## Introducing IBM PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1

This chapter describes the mechanism on which PowerHA SystemMirror works to allow enterprise-level business services to become highly available.

This chapter covers PowerHA SystemMirror concepts, including these new features:

- PowerHA architecture concepts
- Hardware environment
- Cluster scenarios
- New features on PowerHA 7.1.1
- PowerHA 7.1.1 installation
- Migrating to PowerHA 7.1.1

Resources: For more information about PowerHA 7.1.1, see the IBM Information Center for PowerHA SystemMirror:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.aix.powerha.nav igation/powerha\_main.htm

## 1.1  PowerHA architecture concepts

Before you start with the PowerHA features, we suggest a good understanding of the main goals and special PowerHA concepts.

One of the PowerHA solution main goals is to help continuous business services operations even after one (or more) components experience failures. Unexpected failures can happen and they can be related to human errors or other errors. Either way, the PowerHA design phase is intended to remove any Single Point of Failure (SPOF) from the environment by using redundant components and automated PowerHA procedures.

It is important to remember that any hardware component can experience failures and cause application disruptions. So, when you plan a highly available environment, you must check all components, from disk access to power circuits, for redundancy.

See Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2 on page 3 for examples of how an environment can be configured with or without redundant components, and what behavior can be expected in each scenario.

Figure 1-1   A sample client environment with no fault tolerance

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-1 shows a client environment with no fault tolerance mechanisms. So, if any component fails, for example, the company network switch, or the SAN switch, the application that runs on the IBM Power 750 server becomes unavailable due to lack of redundancy.

If failures occur with this configuration, the IBM Power 750 server experiences a disruption until all failing components are replaced or fixed. Depending on which component fails, it can take from hours to weeks to fix it, which affects service availability and in the worst case, data availability.

Figure 1-2   A sample client environment with redundant components

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-2 shows a sample client environment with redundant network connections and dual SAN switches for disk access. The configuration in Figure 1-2 enables the IBM Power 750 server to be more resilient to environmental issues. This resiliency keeps business services available even with failures in parts of the company infrastructure.

Even without using PowerHA features, this configuration is resilient to certain possible failures. If an IP network switch becomes unavailable, the IBM Power 750 server has a secondary network connection on a secondary network switch. If a SAN switch is not available, the IBM Power 750 server can reach its data smoothly through the secondary SAN switch. Therefore, the client environment becomes more resilient to unexpected issues. The client environment allows business services and all their data to be active, accurate, and available to any user all the time.

PowerHA, as requirement, needs redundancy on many components, for example:

- Network access
- SAN disk access
- SAN disk formatting as Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)

When a production environment is to be migrated to a clustered infrastructure, all possible components must be assessed to address all necessary redundancies before the cluster setup. It is important to avoid issues that are caused by no redundant components or SPOF .

For more details about infrastructure requirements for the PowerHA cluster buildup, see Chapter 3, 'PowerHA 7.1.1 basic installation and configuration' on page 73.

High availability solution: It is important to mention that a high availability solution such as IBM PowerHA SystemMirror for AIX helps with the failure of any component, such as hardware, software, or system management. A high availability solution prevents the application and its data from being inaccessible to the user community through the elimination or masking of both planned and unplanned downtime. High availability solutions help eliminate SPOFs through appropriate design, planning, selection of hardware, configuration of software, and carefully controlled change management discipline. High availability does not mean that there is no interruption to the application; therefore, it is called fault resilient instead of tolerant.

Before you start with PowerHA features and configurations, it is important to pay attention to the fundamental PowerHA concepts. The concepts allow a better understanding of all scenarios, configurations, and features that are explained in this publication.

This book is focused on special features in PowerHA 7.1.1 implementation. The book briefly explains the important concepts in PowerHA.

## 1.1.1  Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology (RSCT)

RSCT is a set of low-level operating system components that allow clustering technologies implementation such as PowerHA and General Parallel File System (GPFS). The implementation of RSCT is part of the IBM AIX operating system structure. On the current AIX release, AIX 7.1, RSCT is on Version 3.1.2.0.

All RSCT functionalities are based on the following RSCT components:

- Resource Monitoring and Control (RMC) subsystem: It is considered the backbone of RSCT. It runs on each server and provides a common abstraction about server resources (a hardware or software component that provides services to some other component).
- RSCT Core Resource Manager: It is a software layer between a resource and RMC. Resource Manager maps the abstractions that are defined by RMC to real calls and commands for each resource.
- RSCT Security Services: It provides the security infrastructure that is required so that RSCT components can authenticate the identity of other parties.
- Topology Services subsystem: It provides the node and network monitoring and failure
- detection.

Important: After installing PowerHA and Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) filesets, RSCT Topology Services subsystem is deactivated and all its functionality is performed by CAA.

- Group Services subsystem: It coordinates cross-node operations on cluster environments. This subsystem is responsible to span changes across all cluster nodes and to ensure that all of the changes finished completely with all modifications performed.

Figure 1-3 shows the RSCT filesets that are installed during the AIX 7.1 OS installation with descriptions of their functions.

## 1.1.2 Cluster Aware AIX (CAA)

AIX 7.1 (and 6.1 TL6) introduced a new built-in clustering capability called Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) . This feature enables system administrators to create clusters from a group of AIX instances by using commands and programming APIs. It includes kernel-based heartbeating, monitoring, and an event infrastructure.

CAA is primarily intended to provide a more reliable layer for clustering products such as PowerHA SystemMirror. Also, clients can directly use CAA layer functionalities to enhance their management tasks in their own computer environments.

CAA also introduces a new component, which is required for PowerHA cluster environments, called Cluster Repository Disk . It is a central repository for all cluster topology-related information, and it must be shared by all servers that form the cluster.

In PowerHA 7.1.0, if the repository disk failed, the nodes shut down automatically. A new feature in PowerHA 7.1.1 called Repository Disk Resilience allows administrators to perform cluster maintenance tasks, for example, cluster fallover and fallback, even after the repository disk experiences a failure. Now, CAA supports online repository disk replacement with no cluster effects. For more details about Repository Disk Resilience and the procedure to replace a failing repository disk, see 2.2.7, 'Repository disk resiliency' on page 44.

Important: At the time of writing this publication, CAA does not support IPv6-based network environments. Consider this aspect of CAA when you design your cluster or migrate to later PowerHA releases.

Figure 1-5 shows how AIX, RSCT, CAA, and PowerHA services interact from a software stack perspective.

Figure 1-5   Interaction between AIX, RSCT, CAA, and PowerHA components

<!-- image -->

For more information: For more detailed information about CAA features, functionalities, and operations, see 1.1.2, 'Cluster Aware AIX (CAA)' on page 6. Consider the deprecated CAA command parameters on PowerHA 7.1.1, specifically with the chcluster , clusterconf , and rmcluster commands.

## 1.1.3  PowerHA cluster components

The following sections provide information about the PowerHA cluster components.

## PowerHA cluster

A cluster is a set of connected computer systems that access commonly attached storage. They can be in the same geographical place or data center. Or, they can be separate, such as one data center in the US and another data center in Brazil.

By adopting cluster technologies, companies can increase service reliability to their customers or make disasters not apparent to their customers. So, from the delivered service

quality perspective, a clustered environment enables companies to be better service providers. A clustered environment can continue to operate automatically without being affected by a disaster.

When an initial PowerHA cluster is configured, you assign a cluster name (Figure 1-6). The name is used by PowerHA methods and procedures to work with a specific group of machines, services, and information.

Figure 1-6   Cluster name of a running PowerHA cluster

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-6 shows the cluster name of a running PowerHA cluster. It can be checked by using smitty sysmirror and choosing Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the Cluster  Display PowerHA SystemMirror Configuration options.

Also, the same output can be obtained by using the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/cltopinfo command.

## PowerHA cluster nodes

A PowerHA cluster node is any AIX based system that runs PowerHA services and is part of a PowerHA cluster (Figure 1-7 on page 9).

Figure 1-7   Standard 2-node cluster hardware configuration

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-7 shows a standard cluster configuration with two nodes. The network and the SAN accesses are redundant and data is shared due to the use of shared disk subsystems.

In PowerHA 7.1.1, up to 16 nodes can be included in a single cluster. PowerHA 7.1.1 supports cluster nodes, POWER servers that are divided into logical partitions (LPARs), IBM System i®, Blades, stand-alone POWER servers, or a combination.

A cluster requires infrastructure components that are shared among all cluster nodes. For further details about hardware requirements and configuration, see Chapter 3, 'PowerHA 7.1.1 basic installation and configuration' on page 73.

Important: You cannot dynamically change the host names of any cluster node. To change the name, you must remove the cluster, change the host names, and reconfigure the cluster.

## PowerHA networks

For PowerHA, networks are the paths through which cluster nodes communicate with each other. In addition, all CAA heartbeat messages are sent between the nodes. Also, a network is used by customers or application services to reach services that run on top of the PowerHA cluster layer.

When you define a network, you can choose any name for the network. Make it easy to be identified when you view the cluster topology. Otherwise, PowerHA automatically assigns a network name with the net\_ether\_ XX pattern, as shown in Figure 1-8 on page 10.

Starting with PowerHA 7.1.1, the networks can be Public or Private . The main difference between Public and Private networks is that CAA does not perform heartbeat operations across Private networks.

Figure 1-8   Cluster network configuration

<!-- image -->

## PowerHA IP addresses and IP labels

In a clustered environment, different IP addresses labels can be used:

- Boot (or base) IP label: It is related to the IP that is physically configured to the Ethernet adapters. It is the first IP that is configured on nodes when they finish a boot process.
- Service IP label: It is related to the IP address that is used by application services users to get into application functionalities and data. Normally, it moves between cluster nodes, according to which node is the current holder of the cluster services.
- Persistent IP label: In many cluster configurations, as in the cluster configuration that is used to develop this book, the boot IP addresses are part of a non-routed network. For specific operating system maintenance tasks where the IT support team needs to reach specific nodes, do not use the service IP addresses. To ensure that the IT support team can reach the cluster nodes even when the cluster is not up, persistent IP addresses are used.

## PowerHA service IP addresses distribution policies

Because cluster nodes can have multiple Ethernet adapters, there are seven policies that can be used to service IP distribution:

- Anti-collocation: The standard cluster policy for allocation of the service IP addresses. PowerHA services allocate the service IP addresses in the maximum number of Ethernet adapters that share the network.
- Collocation: PowerHA allocates all service IP addresses that share the same network on the same Ethernet adapter.
- Anti-collocation with persistent label: PowerHA distributes the service IP addresses to all Ethernet adapters that are not hosting the persistent IP address. Service IP and persistent IP addresses share the same Ethernet adapter only if there is a shortage of interfaces.
- Collocation with persistent label: PowerHA allocates all service IP addresses on the Ethernet adapters that are hosting the node persistent IP address. It is useful for environments where certain firewall restrictions are applied and only specific interfaces are allowed to communicate with external networks.
- Anti-collocation with source: Introduced in PowerHA 7.1, service IP addresses are allocated by using the anti-collocation policy but, if there are not enough adapters, more than one service IP address can be put on one adapter. Then, one service IP address is chosen as the source address for communication.

- Collocation with source: Introduced in PowerHA 7.1, service IP addresses are allocated by using the collocation policy. Then, one service IP address is chosen as the source address for communication on the outgoing shared adapter.
- Anti-collocation with persistent label and source: Introduced in PowerHA 7.1, service IP addresses are allocated by using the anti-collocation with persistent label policy. One service IP address can be chosen as the source address if there are multiple service IP addresses on the same boot adapter. A common 2-node network cluster is shown in Figure 1-9.

Figure 1-9   Common network configuration in a 2-node cluster environment

<!-- image -->

## IP address (IPAT)

In most environments, when a service is released to user access, it must be a routable IP address. So, when you design a clustered environment, you must consider how the application services are reached by users on any cluster node.

PowerHA implements one mechanism called IP Address Takeover (IPAT) in which PowerHA services manage all IP addresses that move between cluster nodes by using IP aliases.

When a resource group is moved to a secondary node for any reason, the service IP address that is assigned to the resource group is activated on the secondary node as an IP address alias. The users do not need to care where the services are running. The IP address that is used on the application layer is the same IP address on any cluster node that runs the resource group services.

## PowerHA resources and resource groups

When a client considers purchasing a cluster solution, the goal is to keep specific business applications highly available. Any application, database, or middleware product can be considered a business application.

A Resource is any component that is required to bring up one service application and that, by using PowerHA mechanisms, can be moved from one cluster node to another. A resource can consist of many things:

- File systems
- Raw devices
- Volume groups (VGs)
- IP addresses
- Network File System (NFS) mounts
- Workload partitions (WPARs)
- Applications

To bring up one application, a set of resources is usually required. This set is called the Resource Group .

Figure 1-10 shows a sample cluster scenario with basic shared components.

Figure 1-10   A sample cluster scenario with basic shared components

<!-- image -->

Consider Figure 1-10 to create a sample scenario inside a PowerHA. The shared components (IP addresses, VGs, and file systems) can be put together in a single resource group. The shared components are shared and moved between the two cluster nodes.

Maximum: By using PowerHA 7.1.1, you can configure environments up to a total of 64 resource groups.

## PowerHA resource group policies

When you design a PowerHA cluster, you need to plan how you want the cluster to behave in the event of failure. To make it easier, PowerHA uses methodologies to automatically manage this requirement.

When you define a resource group by using smitty , normally, you see a window similar to Figure 1-11.

Figure 1-11   Resource Group policy definitions on smitty sysmirror menu

As shown in Figure 1-11, there are three types of resource group policies that must be configured during cluster implementation.

The first policy to be configured in the resource groups is called the Startup Policy . It defines when and on which node the resource group is brought online when the cluster is started. The following options are available for the Startup Policy:

- Online on home node only: When this policy is chosen, the resource group is brought online only on the node that is called the home node , which is the first one from the left on the Participant Nodes field in Figure 1-11. By using Figure 1-11 as an example, if this policy is chosen, the resource group rg1 is online only when node1 is online.
- Online on first available node: When this policy is chosen, the resource group is brought online on the first participant node that comes online. By using Figure 1-11 as an example, if this policy is chosen, the resource group rg1 is online on node1 if it is the first available node. Or, it is online on node2 if node2 becomes available first.
- Online using distribution policy: When this policy is chosen, the resource group is brought online by following one of these two methods. The resource groups are distributed, trying to keep only one resource group online on each participant node online ( node-based resource group distribution ). Or, they are distributed trying to keep only one resource group per node and per network ( network-based resource group distribution ).
- Online on all available nodes: When this policy is chosen, the resource group is brought online on all available nodes in the cluster. To avoid data corruption or any application issue, ensure that the components included on the resource group can be used concurrently.

For resource group startup, there is a parameter that can be customized on the PowerHA cluster side. It is called Settling Time. By using Settling Time, any cluster node waits for the configured time to ensure that any other higher priority node is not about to join the cluster. It is an important parameter to use when you have a multiple node cluster, and all of the nodes start simultaneously.

Setting Time parameter: To change or define the Setting Time on a PowerHA cluster, type smitty sysmirror . Then, choose Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Configure Resource Group Run-Time Policies  Configure Setting Time for Resource Groups .

The second policy is called the Fallover Policy . It defines the behavior of resource groups when the node resource group owning node fails. The following options are available for the Fallover Policy:

- Fallover to next priority node in the list: When the owning node online resource group fails, if the resource group is not online on all available nodes, it is brought online on the next node according to the resource group's participant nodes list (as shown in Figure 1-11 on page 13).
- Fallover using dynamic node priority: When the node owning node online resource group fails, the resource group is moved to another node according to the Dynamic Node Priority policy that is defined. These policies are based on RSCT variables, for example, the node with most free memory. Remember that if you choose this option without a defined Dynamic Node Priority policy, you get an error when you perform a cluster configuration synchronization between the cluster nodes.
- Bring offline (on error node only): When the owning node online resource fails, no fallover action is taken. If the resource group is online at one node at a time, the services are unavailable until any administrator action. When the resource group is online on all available nodes, the resource is offline on the failing node only. The resource group continues to work correctly on all another nodes.

The third policy to be configured is called the Fallback Policy . This policy defines what happens with a resource group when a higher priority node, which experienced a failure, rejoins on the cluster. The following options are available for the Fallback Policy:

- Fallback to higher priority node in the list: When you use this policy, if a higher priority node returns to the cluster from a previous failure, the resource group is brought offline anywhere it is resident and brought online on the higher priority node. It is important to remember when you use this automatic fallback method that if an intermittent issue occurs on the higher priority node, the cluster applications start an infinite loop of movement between nodes.
- Never fallback: When you use this policy, even if a higher priority node returns from a previous failure, the resource group remains on the lower priority node until a manual resource group move is performed by the cluster administrator. It is an important configuration to consider while you design the cluster because there is a short disruption while the resource groups are moved to a higher priority node.

Another policy that you might configure when you create a resource group, which is not mandatory, is the Fallback Timer Policy . By using the Fallback Timer Policy, you can configure on which specific frequency a fallback operation can be performed. The following options are available for this policy:

- Daily: Fallback operations are performed on a daily basis, on the hour and date that are set up by the system administrator.
- Weekly: Fallback operations are performed on a weekly basis, on the day, hour, and time that are specified by the system administrator. You can choose only one week day.
- Monthly: Fallback operations are performed on a monthly basis, on the day of the month, hour, and time that are specified by the system administrator. You can choose only one day of the month.

- Yearly: Fallback operations are performed on a yearly basis, on the month, day of the month, hour, and time that are specified by the system administrator. You can choose only a single year, date, and time.

Fallback Timer Policy: To configure the Fallback Timer Policy, type smitty sysmirror . Then, choose Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Configure Resource Group Run-Time Policies  Configure Delayed Fallback Timer Policies . Or, use the smitty cm\_timer\_menu fast path menu.

## PowerHA resource group dependencies

In some cases, multiple applications are distributed together between cluster nodes. This design becomes an issue if you do not check whether any type of relationship exists between applications. This design also becomes an issue if one application must be started first to allow another to start correctly.

To address this issue, PowerHA allows administrators to define the order to start the resource group and any restrictions about how to bring up the nodes. These features are Parent/Child Dependencies , Location Dependencies, and StartAfter/StopAfter policies.

With Parent/Child Dependencies, PowerHA allows administrators to define a specific order to start the resource groups. If one web service depends on the availability of a database, you can define which resource groups must be started first by using PowerHA features. Figure 1-12 on page 16 shows multiple levels of Parent/Child Dependency where the web services run in a resource group that is called Web RG. Web RG depends on the application services inside a resource group called Application RG to start first. Also, the application services require that the database data is available.

Figure 1-12   Parent/Child dependency in PowerHA resource groups

<!-- image -->

Resource Group Parent/Child Dependencies configuration: Enter smitty sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Configure Resource Group Run-Time Policies  Configure Dependencies between Resource Groups  Configure Parent/Child Dependency . Or, use the smitty cm\_rg\_dependencies fast path.

Also, there are cases when different application tiers cannot run on the same server due to internal application restrictions, such as shared memory or specific network port usage. To address this requirement, PowerHA allows Resource Group Location Dependencies. This function enables restrictions on the configuration of resource groups where you can define which resource groups cannot be brought online at the same time on the same cluster node (Figure 1-13 on page 17).

Figure 1-13   A sample cluster environment with location dependency policies

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-13 shows a sample environment where a company has two services that run inside a cluster: a production database and a quality assurance database. Due to the client requirements, the database services that run on DB Prod RG use the same network ports as the database services that run on DB QA RG. An attempt to put one RG online when another RG is already running on a node results in a failure. To prevent this failure, PowerHA allows the configuration to be restricted by using the Resource Group Location Dependencies Policy.

Resource Group Parent/Child Dependencies: Access Resource Group Parent/Child Dependencies by selecting Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Configure Resource Group Run-Time Policies  Configure Dependencies between Resource Groups  Configure Online on the Same Node Dependency and by using smitty sysmirror .

In some cases, application dependencies are not covered by Parent/Child or Location policies. PowerHA V7.1 offers two more policies: StartAfter and StopAfter . The StartAfter policy allows a special dependency, where one resource group is brought online when another resource group is already started. The StopAfter policy allows a dependency where one resource group can be brought offline only when another one is already shut down.

## PowerHA applications

To PowerHA, any process or service that provides information to users is called an application . Because each application can have specific procedures for startup and shutdown, PowerHA requires specific shell scripts to perform application start and stop operations. The PowerHA functions that control structure are the Application Controller Scripts .

Terminology: Before PowerHA 7.1, the terminology and SMIT menus used Application Server . From PowerHA 7.1 forward, we use the new terminology, which is Application Controller .

As shown in Figure 1-14, specify which scripts are used to start and stop the application services when they are brought up or down by PowerHA.

Figure 1-14   Defining Application Controller scripts by using smitty menus

<!-- image -->

For each application, you can also create Application Monitoring Methods . Application monitoring methods are scripts that perform automatic checks on the application to verify that the application functionalities work correctly. If an application monitoring method fails, by default, the cluster moves the resource group to another node. However, it can also be changed to only notify someone.

PowerHA applications can be created by using smitty sysmirror . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure User Applications (Scripts and Monitors)  Application Controller Scripts  Add Application Controller Scripts . Or, use the smitty cm\_add\_app\_scripts fast path.

Important: Be careful with application monitoring methods because the default is for a resource group fallover to occur when a monitoring script ends with an error. Any inconsistency that is in these scripts might result in an unnecessary fallover.

## PowerHA cluster events

If you consider all involved components, PowerHA provides ways to monitor any part of the cluster structure. Also, according to the output of these monitoring methods, the PowerHA cluster takes any automatic action. These actions can be a notification or even a resource group fallover.

PowerHA allows the customization of predefined cluster events and also allows the creation of events. When you create events, it is important to check whether there is a predefined event that covers the desired action to avoid creating unnecessary events ending up in duplications.

All cluster events have their own meaning and behavior. Some examples of cluster events can be seen in Table 1-1 on page 19.

It considers the node gone and starts a node_down event.                                                                                                                                                  |
| network_up     | Network-related events   | A network_up event starts when the cluster detects that a network is available and ready for cluster usage (for a service IP address activation, for example).                                                                                                                             |
| network_down   | Network-related events   | A network_down event starts when a specific network is unreachable. It can be a network_down_local , when only a specific node lost its connectivity for a network. Or, it can be a network_down_global , when all nodes lost connectivity.                                                |
| swap_adapter   | Network-related events   | A swap_adapter event starts when the interface that hosts one service IP address fails. If there are other boot networks available on the same node, the swap_adapter event moves the service IP address to another boot interface and refreshes the network routing table.                |
| fail_interface | Interface-related issues | A fail_interface event starts when any node interface fails. If the interface has no service IP defined, only the fail_interface event runs. If the failing interface hosts a service IP address and there is no other boot interface available to host it, an rg_move event is triggered. |

Events: All events have detailed usage descriptions inside their script files. All events are in the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/events directory. In a case of status change, For an example Node\_down. PowerHA will log the event in the cluster log files. For example, Sep 12 08:01:16 EVENT START: node\_up &lt;NODENAME&gt;.

## PowerHA cluster configurations

PowerHA is flexible and allows many cluster configurations to provide high availability. Several potential configurations are listed with examples to help you understand how they work.

## Standby configuration

In this simple cluster configuration, one node runs all services for a resource group while the other nodes are idle. The other nodes are ready to host the resource group services if the main node fails (Figure 1-15).

Figure 1-15   Sample standby cluster configuration

<!-- image -->

As shown on Figure 1-15, all cluster services are designed to be up on Node 1, since it is the active cluster node. Node 2 remains idle with no cluster services running on it. Only in case of a Node 1 failure, the DB Prod RG resource group automatically moves to Node 2

## Takeover configuration

This configuration allows more efficient hardware usage. All cluster nodes run parts of the production workload. A takeover configuration can be split in two possible subconfigurations: One-Sided Takeover or Mutual Takeover . Further details about the configurations are shown in Figure 1-16 on page 21 and Figure 1-17 on page 21.

Figure 1-16   Sample one-sided takeover cluster configuration

<!-- image -->

As shown in Figure 1-16, on a one-sided takeover cluster configuration, some application parts are brought up as highly available parts and managed by a resource group. In this example, the DB Prod RG, and some application parts run stand-alone, with no high availability behavior and run outside the cluster structure. If Node 1 fails, its services are automatically brought online on Node 2. But if Node 2 fails, its services remain unavailable until it comes back up and runs in production again.

Figure 1-17   Sample mutual takeover cluster configuration

<!-- image -->

As shown in Figure 1-17, on a mutual takeover cluster configuration, all application parts are highly available and managed by a resource group, for example, the DB Prod RG and Web RG. If Node 1 fails, its services are automatically brought online on Node 2. And if Node 2 fails, its services are automatically brought online on Node 1. Either node failure can be covered by the PowerHA cluster structure with minimal effect to the users.

## PowerHA cluster single point of control (C-SPOC)

When you manage a cluster environment, some administrative tasks become more difficult due to the number of managed clusters and managed nodes. Inconsistencies can appear, especially in relationship to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) structure or user and group management. To avoid these issues, PowerHA provides a way to facilitate administrative tasks on all nodes inside a PowerHA cluster that is called Cluster Single Point of Control (C-SPOC).

By using C-SPOC, you can perform the following tasks on all cluster nodes:

- PowerHA services control: startup and shutdown
- Cluster resource group and applications management
- Cluster nodes communication interface management
- File collection management
- Log viewing and management
- AIX operating system user, group, and password management across all cluster nodes
- LVM management
- General Parallel File System (GPFS) tasks
- Smitty session opened on any specific node
- Encrypted File System (EFS) management
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) integration
- Cluster security

Resource: Throughout this book, many tasks are performed by using C-SPOC functionalities to show specific PowerHA features and behavior. For more detailed information about C-SPOC features, see PowerHA SystemMirror system management with C-SPOC :

## PowerHA Smart Assists

Smart Assists are PowerHA tools that help system administrators include applications in a cluster infrastructure. By using Smart Assists, you can create the cluster application environment. Smart Assists take care of the start and stop scripts for the application. Smart Assists work specifically with each application. Individual Smart Assist packages must be installed in addition to the PowerHA base software to allow support for specific applications.

If an application that needs to be included on a cluster environment has no specific Smart Assist product, PowerHA provides a general application Smart Assist (GASA). GASA helps to include those applications in a clustered environment.

Requirements must be addressed before you use Smart Assists:

1. The Smart Assist fileset must be installed on all cluster nodes.
2. Before you use Smart Assists, a basic cluster must be created by using smitty or the IBM Director interface.
3. Before you configure an application inside the cluster by using Smart Assists, you must ensure that the application already can run manually with no issues on all cluster nodes.
4. We strongly suggest that you configure the application with Smart Assist on the cluster node where the application runs currently.
5. Read the PowerHA documentation to satisfy any documented limitation or consideration.

Figure 1-18   Smart Assists available in IBM PowerHA 7.1.1

Figure 1-18 shows many Smart Assists that can be used other than the GASA.

Chapter 5, 'Smart Assists for PowerHA SystemMirror' on page 227 contains detailed explanations about Smart Assist usage with practical examples.

## 1.2  Hardware environment

In the following chapters, we adopted a common environment (Figure 1-19 on page 24) to perform the scenarios that are presented in this book. In this section, the environment description is introduced from the hardware structure to the virtual environment. We include the naming convention that we used with all partitions and SAN disks.

Figure 1-19   ITSO residency hardware environment

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-19 shows the hardware environment that is used in this book. It consists of an IBM TotalStorage DS4800 connected to a dual SAN environment, which is built with two IBM 2005-B16 switches. The servers are IBM POWER7® 750 servers. Figure 1-20 shows the Power 750 servers in the Hardware Management Console (HMC).

Figure 1-20   POWER7 servers in the HMC

<!-- image -->

## Virtualized environment

To mimic a real-world scenario, we built redundant Virtual I/O (VIO) servers on each frame with Shared Ethernet Adapter (SEA) failover and N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) for all client logical partitions (LPARs).

Figure 1-21   Hardware lab virtual environment

<!-- image -->

The virtualization structure in Figure 1-21 shows that all client LPARs have dual Ethernet connections through client SEAs and dual SAN connection through dual NPIV Fibre Channel (FC) adapters. This structure helps provide the correct hardware redundancy for all scenarios that are presented in this book.

## Client LPAR structure

Because we use three physical servers to build the clustered environments for this book, we partitioned the Power 750 frames to create 10 client LPARs per frame that follow the naming standard LPAR&lt; num &gt;.&lt; frame num &gt;, where &lt; num &gt; is the LPAR sequence number and &lt; frame num &gt; is the frame sequence number (Figure 1-22 on page 26).

As shown in Figure 1-22, on frame Server01 (further details in Figure 1-20 on page 24), we created two redundant VIO servers and 10 client LPARs. The same design is adopted for Server02 and Server03 frames.

## SAN storage environment

All scenarios that are shown in this book are implemented with SAN shared disks for data that is used by PowerHA resource groups.

All disks are created on an IBM TotalStorage DS4800 midrange disk system with 1.7 TB of raw data. All data on the system is formatted in RAID-5 and originates from a single large

array called PW2201\_Array . All logical drives that are used on the cluster scenarios are created inside this RAID-5 array with &lt; Cluster Scenario &gt;-&lt; Disk Sequence &gt; as the naming convention. For performance purposes, all logical volumes are created to keep the load balancing between DS4800 Controller A and Controller B.

Figure 1-23   Summary DS4800 disk system view from the IBM Storage Manager tool

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-23 shows the general configuration of the DS4800 disk system that is used during the book scenarios. For each scenario, specific host groups are created to ensure that only the correct nodes can reach logical unit number (LUN) disk sets, as shown in Figure 1-24 on page 28.

Figure 1-24   Host groups that are defined for cluster scenarios

## LPARs access to SAN disks

All hardware connections are configured for redundancy. All clustered LPARs have two NPIV adapters and two paths for disk access, as shown in Figure 1-25 and Figure 1-26 on page 29.

- -Support for mirror pools.
- -Disk renaming support inside the cluster.
- -PowerHA 7.1.1 now supports EMC, Hitachi, and HP disk subsystems multipathing LUN as a clustered repository disk.
- -PowerHA 7.1.1 capability to display disk Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
- -PowerHA 7.1.1 filesystem mounting feature called Mount Guard . After one filesystem is mounted by using this feature, AIX ensures that no other node can improperly mount the same filesystem, at the same time, which can cause data corruption.
- Application management: A new application startup option is available on PowerHA 7.1.1. When you add an application controller, you can choose the Application Startup Mode. Now, you can choose background startup mode, which is the default and where the cluster activation moves forward with an application start script that runs in the background. Or,

you can choose foreground startup mode. When you choose the application controller option, the cluster activation is sequential, which means that cluster events hold application startup script execution. If the application script ends with a failure (non-zero return code), the cluster activation is considered to failed, as well.

## Network features

PowerHA 7.1.1 offers more network management features. It is now possible to define a network as private and more network tunables are provided.

Network features: For more details about the new administrative and network management features, see Chapter 4, 'Cluster administration' on page 149.

## Smart Assist features

Within PowerHA 7.1.1, new Smart Assists are included for the following applications:

- SAP liveCache Hot Standby for fast failover with IBM DS8000® and SAN Volume Controller
- MQ Series Smart Assist

Smart Assist: For more details about Smart Assists usage and new features, see Chapter 5, 'Smart Assists for PowerHA SystemMirror' on page 227 and 7.3.2, 'Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for SAP' on page 366.

## 1.5  PowerHA 7.1.1 installation

When you install PowerHA 7.1.1, it is important to have a supported environment. This chapter provides a brief introduction and description for all topics that relate to PowerHA 7.1.1 product installation. For detailed information about this topic, see Chapter 3, 'PowerHA 7.1.1 basic installation and configuration' on page 73.

## Supported hardware

PowerHA 7.1.1 supports POWER5, IBM POWER6®, POWER7, and Power Blades servers.

From disk subsystems, PowerHA allows the usage of multiple disk solutions as shared disks between cluster nodes. The following IBM TotalStorage systems are supported:

- DS3000 family
- IBM DS4000® family
- DS5000 family
- IBM DS6000™ family
- DS8000 family
- IBM XIV®

For all information that relates to version compatibility between AIX, PowerHA, and IBM disk subsystems, see this website:

http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/TD105638

For the latest firmware upgrades for server and disk subsystems, see IBM Fix Central:

http://support.ibm.com/fixcentral

Matrix: For a complete list of supported hardware for PowerHA 7.1.1 and as the minimum operating system level that is required, see the PowerHA Hardware Support Matrix:

http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/TD105638

## Supported AIX OS versions

The minimum AIX level that is required to install PowerHA 7.1.1 is AIX 6.1 TL7 SP2 or AIX 7.1 TL1 SP2. We suggest that you keep your environment on the newest Technology Level that is available for your AIX release before you start with PowerHA 7.1.1.

Important: There is no support for AIX 5.3. Any environment that still runs AIX 5.3 must be upgraded to AIX 6.1 TL7 SP02 at a minimum before you install or migrate to PowerHA 7.1.1.

The latest AIX updates are at IBM Fix Central:

http://support.ibm.com/fixcentral

## Disk space requirements

PowerHA 7.1.1 requires a specific amount of free filesystem space for installation. Check that the following requirements are satisfied before you start the PowerHA 7.1.1 filesets installation:

- The / filesystem must have at least 1 MB of free disk space.
- The /usr filesystem must have at least 82 MB of free disk space.

The cluster logs are stored inside the /var/log and /var/hacmp directories. It is important to keep adequate free space available in the /var filesystem, or it can lead to serious problems within the PowerHA cluster.

## PowerHA 7.1.1 filesets

The PowerHA 7.1.1 installation media contains several filesets. Figure 1-27 shows the names and descriptions of these filesets.

## Obtaining PowerHA 7.1.1 updates

After you install PowerHA 7.1.1, a common practice is to apply the latest service packs (SPs) on the system. All updates and SPs that relate to any IBM product, including PowerHA 7.1.1, are in IBM Support Fix Central:

http://support.ibm.com/fixcentral

For more information: For further details about planning and the design steps both before and during a PowerHA 7.1.1 installation, see Chapter 3, 'PowerHA 7.1.1 basic installation and configuration' on page 73.

## 1.6  Migrating to PowerHA 7.1.1

If your current PowerHA environment runs at 5.4.1 or later, you can migrate your cluster to the current PowerHA Version 7.1.1. PowerHA supports migrations for earlier versions to current releases:

- Offline migration: PowerHA services are brought offline on all nodes before any upgrade task is performed. During the upgrade period, no resources are available to users.
- Snapshot migration: The following actions occur with this upgrade approach:
- -A cluster snapshot is taken.
- -PowerHA cluster services are brought offline on all nodes.
- -The current PowerHA release is uninstalled.
- -PowerHA 7.1.1 is installed.
- -The snapshot is converted by using the clconvert\_snapshot utility.
- -The cluster configuration from the snapshot is restored.
- Rolling migration: During a rolling migration only one node is stopped and updated at a time. The next node is only upgraded when the previous one is successfully upgraded and rejoins the cluster.

## Migration requirements

It is important to know the supported PowerHA migration methods. The following guidelines apply to a PowerHA 7.1.1 migration:

- PowerHA 7.1.1 supports automatic migration from the following prior releases:
- -PowerHA 5.4.1
- -PowerHA 5.5
- -PowerHA 6.1
- -PowerHA 7.1.0
- To migrate from PowerHA 7.1.0 to PowerHA 7.1.1, you can use only offline migration or snapshot migration.
- Due to CAA characteristics, PowerHA 7.1.1 does not support a migration from an old PowerHA release that uses IPv6-based networks.
- After all migration steps are done, apply all latest updates for the PowerHA cluster product.

For more information: All detailed steps for PowerHA cluster migration from earlier (supported) versions to PowerHA 7.1.1 are fully described in Chapter 6, 'Migration scenarios' on page 255.

## Cluster Aware AIX

This chapter provides information about Cluster Aware AIX (CAA). This chapter includes new features for Release 2 (R2), and the differences from Release 1 (R1).

This chapter discusses the following topics:

- Introduction
- Changes and new features
- Security
- Deadman switch (DMS)
- The central repository disk
- Repository disk for third-party multipathing
- Repository disk resiliency
- CAA start and stop commands
- CAA tunables
- Troubleshooting CAA
- Statistics
- Gathering more cluster information
- CAA cluster commands and force option
- Restricting interfaces from clustering use
- VLAN tagging
- Round-trip time and heartbeats
- End-to-end monitoring
- CAA daemons
- CAA multicast

## 2.1  Introduction

Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) introduces fundamental clustering capabilities into the base AIX operating system. These capabilities include the creation and definition of the set of nodes that comprise the cluster. CAA provides the tools and monitoring capabilities for the detection of node and interface health.

Filesets: CAA is provided by the AIX filesets bos.cluster.rte , bos.ahafs , and bos.cluster.solid . These filesets are included in AIX 6.1 TL6 and later, and in the AIX 7.1 installation media.

For more information about CAA, see the information center:

http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.aix.clusteraware/clawa re\_main.htm

CAA provides a set of tools and APIs to enable clustering on the AIX operating system. CAA does not provide the application monitoring and resource failover capabilities that PowerHA provides. Other applications and software programs can use the APIs and command-line interfaces (CLIs) that CAA provides to make their applications and services 'Cluster Aware'.

Figure 2-1 shows a high-level architectural view of how IBM high availability (HA) applications PowerHA and Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) clustered storage use Resource Monitoring and Control (RSCT) and the CAA architecture.

Figure 2-1   HA applications that use RSCT and CAA

<!-- image -->

The following products use the CAA technology:

- RSCT (3.1 and later)
- PowerHA (7.1 and later)
- VIOS 2.2.0.11-FP-24 SP-01 and later

CAA provides the following features among others:

- Central repository:
- -Configuration
- -Security
- Quorumless (CAA does not require a quorum to be up and operational)
- Monitoring capabilities for custom actions
- Fencing aids:
- -Network
- -Storage
- -Applications

The following sections explain some of the concepts of the CAA central repository, changes from previous versions, and how PowerHA 7.1.1 uses CAA.

Important: If you use PowerHA, you do not need to manually configure the CAA cluster. Any configuration changes in the CAA cluster are managed by the PowerHA configuration tools.

CAA does not support IPv6-based network environments.

## 2.2  Changes and new features

We describe the changes and new features in the 2011 release of CAA, and its impact on PowerHA 7.1.1 functionality:

- Changes
- Security
- Deadman switch
- The central repository disk
- CAA and IBM solidDB®
- Repository disk for third-party multipath disks
- Repository disk resilience
- Synchronous configuration changes
- Start and stop commands
- CAA tunables
- Troubleshooting CAA - snap &amp; logs
- Statistics
- How to gather more cluster information
- CAA cluster commands and force option
- The use of the ifrestrict file
- Added support for VLAN tagging
- Round-trip time and heartbeats

## 2.2.1 Changes

The following list summarizes the changes and updates in the 2011 release of CAA:

- Upgrading AIX in a CAA cluster to AIX 6.1 TL07 or to AIX 7.1 TL01 is not supported.
- To upgrade from AIX 6.1 TL6 to TL7 or from AIX 7 to TL1, first remove the CAA cluster, and then install AIX 6 with 6100-07 or install AIX 7 with 7100-01 on all nodes that are part of the new cluster. See Appendix A, 'AIX upgrades and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0' on page 531.
- CAA no longer uses embedded IBM solidDB database. The solid and solidhac daemons are no longer used by CAA.
- The CAA infrastructure now provides limited support for third-party multipathing software. No disk events are available for these disks, but they can be configured into a cluster as a repository or as shared disks.
- CAA commands no longer support force cleanup options. The following list shows the options, by command, that are not supported in the 2011 release:
- -chcluster -f
- -rmcluster -f
- -clusterconf -f , -s , -u

The clctrl command can be used for tuning the cluster subsystem.

Important: Only tune the cluster subsystem under the direction of IBM customer support.

## 2.2.2  Security

Secure the core communication between nodes in the cluster by using one of the following encryption mechanisms.

The following encryption keys are supported:

- Message Digest 5 (MD5) with Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- MD5 with Triple DES
- MD5 with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

The following certificates are supported:

- Open Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- Self-signed certificates
- Secure Shell (SSH) certificates

You can configure the security options and options to distribute encryption keys by using the SMIT interface or the clctrl command:

- smit clustsec
- clctrl -sec

## 2.2.3  Deadman switch (DMS)

A deadman switch is an action that occurs when CAA detects that a node is isolated in a multinode environment. No network or disk communication occurs between nodes.

While it might not seem obvious, the reason for implementing the DMS is to protect the data on the external disks.

The AIX operating system reacts differently depending on the DMS (deadman\_mode) tunable. The deadman switch mode can be set to either force a system crash or generate an Autonomic Health Advisor File System (AHAFS) event. See Example 2-1 for the DMS tunable options help and Example 2-2 for a listing of the current DMS tunable status.

The CAA DMS tunable (deadman\_mode) allows two actions:

- Assert (crash) the system
- Generate AHAFS event

Example 2-1   DMS tunable options

## root@caa2 / # clctrl -tune -h deadman\_mode

Tuning:

Help for tunable deadman\_mode:

Purpose:

Controls the behavior of the deadman timer.  The interval associated with this timer is the node\_timeout tunable.

Scope: clusterwide, per node

Values:

Default: a

Range: a, e

Unit:

When the value is set to "a" (assert), the node will crash upon the deadman timer popping.

When the value is set to "e" (event), an AHAFS event is generated.

A node-specific setting trumps the cluster-wide setting and can be used to override the behavior on a per-node basis.

Example 2-2   Listing DMS tunable status

| root@caa1 / # clctrl -tune -L deadman_mode                                                                                    | root@caa1 / # clctrl -tune -L deadman_mode                                                                                    | root@caa1 / # clctrl -tune -L deadman_mode                                                                                    | root@caa1 / # clctrl -tune -L deadman_mode                                                                                    | root@caa1 / # clctrl -tune -L deadman_mode                                                                                    | root@caa1 / # clctrl -tune -L deadman_mode                                                                                    | root@caa1 / # clctrl -tune -L deadman_mode   |

By default, the CAA deadman\_mode option is 'a'. If the deadman timeout is reached, the node crashes immediately to prevent a partitioned cluster and data corruption.

Next, we present a scenario of a node isolation in a running mutual takeover PowerHA cluster, a consequent deadman switch is triggered, and a node crashes. Look for the behavior of PowerHA and CAA clusters on the surviving node.

Figure 2-2 on page 40 shows the initial status of the PowerHA cluster.

Figure 2-2   Status of the cluster before the deadman switch

<!-- image -->

We unmap the repository disk from the storage for both nodes to simulate the loss of the disk. Then, we detach the Ethernet interfaces on the caa1 node, type the next commands (Example 2-3) to simulate the network failure, and stop any communication between the nodes.

```
root@caa1 / #ifconfig en2 down detach root@caa1 / #ifconfig en1 down detach root@caa1 / #ifconfig en0 down detach root@caa1 / #
```

Example 2-3   Ifconfig commands to disconnect the network

After some seconds, the caa1 node crashes (Example 2-5 on page 41) with the KERNEL\_PANIC and the UNEXPECTED SYSTEM HALT messages in the AIX error log.

Example 2-4 shows the system configuration attribute that causes the reboot after the DMS crashes the system.

```
root@caa1 / # lsattr -El sys0|grep restart autorestart true Automatically REBOOT OS after a crash True root@caa1 / #
```

Example 2-4   Autorestart system configuration attribute

Example 2-5 on page 41 shows the message in the AIX error log when the DMS kernel extension is triggered.

## 2.2.4  The central repository disk

PowerHA SystemMirror uses a shared disk across the cluster as a central repository for managing the configuration of the cluster. This disk must be accessible by all of the nodes in the cluster.

With CAA, you can use the cluster repository disk for the following purposes:

- Cluster-wide configuration management
- Cluster messaging and heartbeating

The amount of configuration information that is stored on this repository disk is directly dependent on the number of cluster entities, such as shared disks, number of nodes, and number of adapters in the environment. You must ensure that you have enough space for the following components when you determine the size of a repository disk:

- Node-to-node communication
- Cluster topology management
- All migration processes

You must have at least 512 MB and no more than 460 GB of disk space that is allocated for the repository disk. Normally, 1 GB is enough for any configuration.

The repository disk is partitioned by the cluster to maintain redundant copies of the information, and to provide high availability for the configuration data and cluster communication. Use RAID technology to protect this disk from any disk failure. Use the PowerHA SystemMirror snapshot function to back up or restore any cluster configurations.

Important: The loss of the cluster repository disk does not affect the normal PowerHA cluster operation. This information is true only for PowerHA 7.1.1; it is not true for PowerHA 7.1.0). However, changes to the PowerHA cluster configuration are not possible if the repository disk fails. See 2.3, 'End-to-end monitoring' on page 66.

The AIX operating system manages repository disks in a special way during the configuration of a cluster. AIX cluster services recognize the repository disk during the AIX device configuration process and can perform special actions on the disk. Cluster services also generate detailed events in relationship to the health of the repository disk. For example, the repository disk is used by the cluster services to enable disk-based communication across hosts. Disk communication involves one host that writes to the disk and the other host or hosts retrieving the message through a polling mechanism.

Important: Users must not work with the repository disk and the Volume Group (VG) that is created on it by using varyonvg , varyoffvg , or mklv . This disk and VG are for the exclusive use of CAA.

## 2.2.5  CAA and the IBM solidDB

CAA support is either removed or deprecated for these previously available features:

- IBM solidDB is no longer used by CAA.
- The logical volumes fslv00 and fslv01 with file system mount points of /clrepos\_private1 and /clrepos\_private2 no longer exist.
- CAA no longer attempts to create a consistent repository disk device view across the cluster.

With R2 of CAA, solidDB is no longer used. The solid and solidhac subsystems are present but dormant on the system. The fileset bos.cluster.solid is installed but not used.

Example 2-6 shows the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and file system structure of a CAA R1 repository disk.

```
# lsvg -l caavg_private caavg_private: LV NAME TYPE LPs PPs PVs LV STATE MOUNT POINT caalv_private1 boot 1 1 1 closed/syncd N/A caalv_private2 boot 1 1 1 closed/syncd N/A caalv_private3 boot 4 4 1 open/syncd N/A fslv00 jfs2 4 4 1 closed/syncd /clrepos_private1 fslv01 jfs2 4 4 1 open/syncd /clrepos_private2 powerha_crlv boot 1 1 1 closed/syncd N/A
```

Example 2-6 Content of previous caavg\_private volume group

As shown in Example 2-7, the CAA R2 does not create file systems /clrepos\_private1 , /clrepos\_private2 , and their associated logical volumes, fslv00 and fslv01. With this change, CAA makes raw I/O requests to the repository disk.

```
# lsvg -l caavg_private caavg_private: LV NAME             TYPE       LPs     PPs     PVs  LV STATE      MOUNT POINT
```

Example 2-7   Content of the caavg\_private volume group

| caalv_private1   | boot   |   1 |   1 |   1 | closed/syncd   | N/A   |
|------------------|--------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|-------|
| caalv_private2   | boot   |   1 |   1 |   1 | closed/syncd   | N/A   |
| caalv_private3   | boot   |   4 |   4 |   1 | open/syncd     | N/A   |
| powerha_crlv     | boot   |   1 |   1 |   1 | closed/syncd   | N/A   |

## 2.2.6  Repository disk for third-party multipathing

The AIX operating system can configure the following types of disks as repository disks:

- AIX multipath disks (AIX MPIO)

These disks can be automatically created and used as repository disks.

- Third-party multipath disks

These disks follow the guidelines of AIX multipathing concepts, but provide their own multipathing device drivers and software. These disks can be configured as repository disks when the relevant Object Data Manager (ODM) information is available. Disks that are managed by EMC PowerPath and Hitachi Dynamic Link Manager (HDLM) can be configured as repository disks by using this method.

## 2.2.7  Repository disk resiliency

Repository resiliency is a new feature that allows the replacement of a failed repository disk on a running PowerHA SystemMirror cluster with no downtime. CAA repopulates the new disk with cluster-related information and starts to use that disk as the repository disk.

The repository disk resiliency function requires these software levels at a minimum:

- PowerHA 7.1.1 SP1
- AIX 6.1 TL7 SP3
- AIX 7.1 TL1 SP3

CAA can handle these failures without affecting critical cluster functions. The PowerHA cluster operates in a restricted mode until you replace the failed repository disk. In this mode of operation, most topology-related operations are not allowed. For example, a node cannot be added or a node cannot join the PowerHA cluster. However, critical PowerHA cluster functions, such as moving a resource group from an active node to a standby node, are handled by the cluster.

Important: You must configure a repository disk through multipathing and RAID configurations if you want a highly available environment.

## Viewing the status of the repository disk

CAA runs verification checks to detect when a repository disk failure occurs and generates a notification message in the cluster event log file ( hacmp.out ). The notification messages continue until you replace the failed repository disk with a new repository disk. These verification checks are performed when the CAA configuration daemon runs, every 10 minutes, and also every time that the disk is required for a particular function (cluster creation, cluster deletion, or cluster modification). These checks include disk existence and repository signature validation.

Parallel to CAA, the storage framework also checks for repository disk existence and notifies CAA when it loses connectivity to the repository disk. When this situation occurs, CAA looks to the repos\_mode tunable for the user-desired assertion: currently either logging the event

through the AIX error log facilities or asserting (deliberately crashing) the system. See 2.2.10, 'CAA tunables' on page 54.

## Status of the cluster before the repository disk fails

Figure 2-4 shows the hdisk2 that is configured as the repository disk with the caavg\_private VG in the active state.

## Failure of the repository disk

For this test, to simulate the repository disk failure, we unmap the logical unit number (LUN) from the storage for both nodes.

Almost immediately after we simulate the failure, we start to see error messages in the PowerHA event log file and the AIX error log, as usual, as shown in Figure 2-7 on page 48.

```

## Testing critical cluster functions

For this test, we start with the cluster active and running in a mutual takeover configuration as shown in Figure 2-10. We simulate the failure of the repository disk by unmapping the disk from the Storage Manager.

Next, we show the output for some commands, such as clRGinfo and lscluster , so that we can check the status of the cluster and to show that the cluster still provides critical functions (Figure 2-10):

- Move a resource group (RG) to the other node
- Bring an RG offline
- Bring an RG online on the home node again

## Replacing the failed repository disk in a running cluster

In this section, details are provided about how to replace a failed repository disk in a running cluster.

## Replacing a repository disk with SMIT

To replace a repository disk with a new disk, complete the following steps:

1. From the command line, enter smit sysmirror .
2. From the SMIT interface, select Problem Determination Tools  Select a new Cluster repository disk , and press Enter.
3. In the repository disk field, press F4 (Lists of available new repository disks). SMIT shows only shared disks whose size is 512 MB - 460 GB. Select an available disk from all nodes in the cluster, or enter the name of the disk. Press Enter to set up the selected disk as the new repository disk for the cluster.
4. Verify and synchronize the cluster configuration.
5. After all nodes are updated, verify that the new repository disk works by running the /usr/sbin/lscluster -d command.

## Replacing a repository disk from the command line

To replace a repository disk with a new disk, complete the following steps from the command line:

1. From the command line, use the clmgr command to replace the disk:
2. clmgr modify cluster caa\_cl REPOSITORY=hdiskX
2. Verify and synchronize the PowerHA configuration:
4. clmgr verify cluster CHANGES\_ONLY=yes SYNC=yes
3. After all nodes are updated, verify that the new repository disk works by running the /usr/sbin/lscluster -d command.

## 2.2.8  CAA configuration changes are synchronous

All cluster configuration events occur through a new process that is called ' coordinated configuration '. This process is a synchronous sequence of steps in which all nodes of the cluster must agree before committing the change. The change is committed to all nodes simultaneously. Only one coordinated configuration operation is allowed at a time. The coordinated configuration operation stops on the first failure. This new feature is introduced to prevent situations where the cluster state and status differ between the nodes.

The following configuration tasks are coordinated across the cluster:

- Cluster creation
- Add or remove nodes or disks
- Cluster removal
- Stop or start the node
- Node reboot

## 2.2.9  CAA start and stop commands

The clctrl command provides a set of subcommands for managing a CAA cluster. The start and stop subcommands are new in R2 of CAA:

- The -stop subcommand is used to take one or more nodes offline for maintenance. Stopping a node causes the other nodes to consider it as down.
- A stopped node does not send or receive heartbeat messages, and it remains in the stopped state, even across a reboot operation, until a -start subcommand causes it to rejoin the cluster.
- The -stop subcommand can also be issued while a node is powered off to prevent it from rejoining the cluster when it is rebooted.
- The -start subcommand is used to bring one or more nodes online after they are offline for maintenance. Starting a node allows it to rejoin the cluster and have the other nodes consider it as up.
- The -start subcommand can also be issued while a node is powered off to allow it to rejoin the cluster when it is rebooted.

To stop a node, you can issue the command as shown in Example 2-10 on page 54 from any active node in the cluster. The stop is persistent across node reboots until you issue the start command.

Example 2-10   Stop a cluster node

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The stop command is useful, for example, if you need to install device drivers on the node or maintain the node.

To start a node, issue the command as shown in Example 2-11.

Example 2-11 Start a cluster node clctrl - start -m &lt; node &gt;

## 2.2.10 CAA tunables

With the clctrl command and by using the tune subcommand, you can list or change some configuration options across cluster nodes. The -tune subcommand is used to display or set cluster tunable values. Table 2-1 shows the flags that control the -tune subcommand.

Table 2-1   Flags that control the -tune subcommand

## Changing CAA tunables

To set a tunable value, you can use the following command syntax:

clctrl -tune -o &lt; tunable &gt;=&lt; value &gt;

This command modifies the tunable across the cluster in the repository disk. The new value becomes active at the next start of the node.

Example 2-12 shows the help for the repository disk repos\_mode tunable. This tunable defines the action of a node that is part of a CAA cluster if the access to the repository disk is lost for the node.

```
root@caa2 / # clctrl -tune -h repos_mode Help for tunable repos_mode: Purpose: Controls node behavior when cluster repository access is lost. Scope: clusterwide, per node Values: Default: e Range: a, e Unit: Tuning: When the value is set to "a" (assert), the node will crash upon losing access to the cluster repository. When the value is set to "e" (event), an AHAFS event is generated. A node-specific setting trumps the cluster-wide setting and can be used to override the behavior on a per-node basis.
```

Example 2-12   clctrl repos\_mode tunable help

To see the actual configuration of the repos\_mode tunable, use the command in Example 2-13. In this case, the tunable is configured with the default value of 'e'. Therefore, when a node loses access to the repository disk only, an AHAFS event is generated.

We can use the command in Example 2-14 to change this behavior and change the value from 'e' (event) to 'a' (assert). After changing this tunable, reboot the node to apply the changes. If the repository disk is lost, the node crashes instead of generating an AHAFS event.

```
root@caa2 / # clctrl -tune -o repos_mode=a 1 tunable updated on cluster caa_cl.

## 2.2.11  Troubleshooting CAA

We provide details about troubleshooting CAA by using the snap command. We review the syslog facility.

## SNAP command

The clustering subsystem provides a snap script to help you collect logs and provides data configuration that you can use to help troubleshoot problems.

The snap caa command collects data and log files in the directory structure as shown in Example 2-15 on page 57.

Example 2-15   snap caa command

```
root@caa2 / # snap caa ********Checking and initializing directory structure Creating /tmp/ibmsupt/caa directory tree... done. Creating /tmp/ibmsupt/testcase directory tree... done. Creating /tmp/ibmsupt/other directory tree... done. ********Finished setting up directory /tmp/ibmsupt Checking Space requirement for caa Checking for enough free space in filesystem... done. Gathering caa data
```

## Log file

CAA uses the syslog facility to log debug information and errors. Example 2-16 shows the default syslog configuration for CAA.

Example 2-16   CAA syslog configuration /etc/syslog.conf file caa.info /var/adm/ras/syslog.caa rotate size 1m files 10

You can edit the /etc/syslog.conf file if you want to troubleshoot any particular problem. For example, you can change from *.info to the *.debug facility, which provides more information.

Refresh: You need to refresh the syslog daemon if you modify the configuration file.

The following information is in the CAA log file:

- All configuration commands ( mkcluster , rmcluster , and chcluster )
- All storage events and their delivery to the cluster network
- Error events

## 2.2.12  Statistics

To display the cluster statistics, use the lscluster -s command as shown in Example 2-17.

```
root@caa1 / # lscluster -s Cluster Statistics:
```

## 2.2.14  CAA cluster commands and force option

In the R2 release of CAA, the -f flag is not used to force the commands. See 2.2.1, 'Changes' on page 38 for a list of commands that are not supported. If you want to force some CAA commands, the environment variable CAA\_FORCE\_ENABLE is set to 1 before executing the command instead of using the -f flag.

Example 2-22 shows the rmcluster with force to scrub the repository disk and ignore all errors.

Example 2-22   rmcluster command with force

# export CAA\_FORCE\_ENABLED=1

# rmcluster -r hdisk2

See Table 2-2 on page 60 for a list of CAA commands and actions with and without the force option.

Table 2-2   CAA commands

| Command         | No force                                                | With force                                                                                                               |

## 2.2.15 Restricting interfaces from clustering use

When you create a cluster, all network interfaces that are configured with an IP address are used by CAA to exchange multicast packets between nodes. To restrict specific interfaces, you can configure them as type private. Every interface of a network that is defined as private in the PowerHA configuration is listed in the /etc/cluster/ifrestrict file, and it is not used by the CAA multicast communication.

Important: Interfaces that are not defined in the HA topology can still be restricted. A typical example is a virtual LAN (VLAN) that is dedicated to backups and that is not included in the HA topology. If a client wants to reduce or avoid unnecessary traffic, the client adds the VLAN to the ifrestrict (even if it is not in the HA topology). After the client manually edits the ifrestrict file, the client must also run clusterconf to instruct CAA to include the change (even with HA active).

The following AIX levels are required to support this functionality:

- AIX 6.1 TL6 SP4 (bos.cluster.rte 6.1.6.4) and up
- AIX 7.1 TL0 SP3 (bos.cluster.rte 7.1.0.15) and up

## Restricting interfaces

We describe how to restrict interfaces in a 2-node cluster with two networks that are configured as public with two interfaces each (Figure 2-15 on page 61).

Private networks: The private network is reintroduced in PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. It is used for Oracle interconnect purposes only. No other external or user traffic is allowed to use it. There is no heartbeating or any PowerHA related communication on it. The private adapters are listed in the /etc/cluster/ifrestrict file. Y ou cannot mark the interface that has the host name as private.

Figure 2-15   Two-node cluster with two defined networks

<!-- image -->

Example 2-23 shows the AIX network configuration for both nodes.

```

To restrict specific interfaces for cluster usage, follow these steps:

1. Define the network as a private network in the PowerHA configuration (Figure 2-17 on page 63). Use smitty sysmirror . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage Networks and Network Interfaces  Networks  Change/Show a Network .

```

```

Figure 2-17   Change the network attribute to private

2. Stop the cluster services in all nodes.
3. Verify and synchronize the cluster configuration.

Important: If you try to synchronize the cluster configuration with the cluster services running, the synchronization fails with this error:

cldare: Changes made to the networking configuration will result in IP aliasing support being enabled or disabled.  Please note that changing these network parameters via a DARE is not supported.

4. Start the cluster services.

Restricting an interface: The /etc/cluster/ifrestrict file is created every time that PowerHA starts. This file can be edited manually, which is the only way that a client can restrict an interface that is not in the PowerHA topology.

## Testing the restricted interfaces

After you perform these steps, verify that the /etc/cluster/ifrestrict file is created in every cluster node (Figure 2-18 on page 64). This file contains the interfaces that belong to the private network in the PowerHA configuration and that are restricted to CAA.

```
root@caa1 # cat /etc/cluster/ifrestrict en1 ----root@caa2 # cat /etc/cluster/ifrestrict en1
```

Figure 2-18   Content of /etc/cluster/ifrestrict file

We see the en1 interface with the status DOWN RESTRICTED in the lscluster command output. This status means that CAA does not use this interface for multicasting any longer as shown in Figure 2-19.

```
Interface number 2 en1 ifnet type = 6 ndd type = 7 Mac address length = 6 Mac address = b6.fc.c1.1f.84.70 Smoothed rrt across interface = 7 Mean Deviation in network rrt across interface = 3 Probe interval for interface = 100 ms ifnet flags for interface = 0x1e080863 ndd flags for interface = 0x21081b Interface state  DOWN  RESTRICTED  SOURCE HARDWARE RECEIVE  SOURCE HARDWARE TRANSMIT Number of regular addresses configured on interface = 1 IPV4 ADDRESS: 10.1.2.48  broadcast 10.1.2.255  netmask 255.255.255.0 Number of cluster multicast addresses configured on interface = 1 IPV4 MULTICAST ADDRESS: 228.1.1.48  broadcast 0.0.0.0  netmask 0.0.0.0
```

Figure 2-19   Output of the lscluster -i command for the restricted interface

You can also use the tcpdump command to verify that there is no multicast traffic in the restricted interface as shown in Figure 2-20.

```
root@caa2 /etc/cluster # tcpdump -t -i2 -v ip and host 228.1.1.48
```

Figure 2-20   Tcpdump command output for the restricted interface

```
tcpdump: listening on en1, link-type 1, capture size 96 bytes 820 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel
```

You can also use the tcpdump command for the non-restricted interface. Figure 2-21 on page 65 shows how the multicast traffic goes through the interface.

```
root@caa2 /etc/cluster # tcpdump -t -i1 -v ip and host 228.1.1.48 tcpdump: listening on en0, link-type 1, capture size 96 bytes IP (tos 0x0, ttl  32, id 0, offset 0, flags [none], proto: UDP (17), length: 1478) caa2.drmsfsd > 228.1.1.48.drmsfsd: UDP, length 1450 IP (tos 0x0, ttl  32, id 0, offset 0, flags [none], proto: UDP (17), length: 1478) caa2.drmsfsd > 228.1.1.48.drmsfsd: UDP, length 1450 ...

```

Figure 2-21   Tcpdump command output in a non-restricted interface

Important: You cannot configure the network as private in PowerHA if you have a mix of Boot and Service or Persistent IPs that are configured in the network. It fails with the following error:

ERROR: Network net\_ether\_02 has a mix of interface types. Only networks with all boot or all service labels can be converted to private.

After the changes are completed, the new scenario for the 2-node cluster with one Public and one Private Network is shown in Figure 2-22.

## 2.2.16 VLAN tagging

In previous versions of AIX 7.1 and AIX 6.1, CAA did not accept packets with VLAN tags in the Ethernet header. Any network interfaces that are defined on top of an AIX VLAN adapter must be 'restricted' through the CAA ifrestrict mechanism.

As of AIX 7.1 TL1 SP03 and AIX 6.1 TL7 SP03, CAA fully supports VLAN tagging, including the use of AIX pseudo VLAN devices.

## 2.2.17  Round-trip time and heartbeats

Unlike previous versions of PowerHA, normally heartbeat tuning is unnecessary. CAA monitors the interfaces of each node by using the multicast protocol and gossip packets. Gossip packets are periodically sent from each node in the cluster for timing purposes. These gossip packets are automatically replied to by the other nodes in the cluster. The packet exchanges are used to calculate the round-trip time.

The round-trip time ( rtt ) value is shown in the output of the lscluster -i and lscluster -m commands. The mean deviation in network rtt is the average round-trip time, which is automatically managed by CAA.

To change the cluster heartbeat settings, modify the failure cycle and the grace period for the PowerHA cluster from the custom cluster configuration in the SMIT sysmirror panel (Example 2-25). Use smit sysmirror . Select Custom Cluster Configuration  Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the Cluster  Cluster heartbeat settings .

Example 2-25   Cluster heartbeat settings SMIT panel

```
Cluster heartbeat settings Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes. [Entry Fields] * Grace Period                                       [0] * Failure Cycle                                      [0]
```

In Example 2-25, the following definitions apply:

- Grace period : The grace period is the amount of time in seconds that the node waits before the node marks the remote node as DOWN. This value can be 5 - 30 seconds. The default value is zero seconds.
- Failure cycle : The failure cycle determines the frequency of the heartbeat. This value can be 1 - 20 seconds. The default value is zero seconds.

## 2.3  End-to-end monitoring

We provide the monitoring details.

## Point-of-contact

A point-of-contact is a receive-side entity in software that is used to indicate connectivity from the current node to another node in the cluster. It correlates with an actual communications interface from which traffic from the remote node is received. A point-of-contact is most

important for when CAA performs unicast communications between the current node and a specific other node.

A point-of-contact indicates that a node actually received communication packets across this interface from another node. This communication process allows the application that is monitoring the health of a node to act discretely based on near real-time event notification. You can also monitor the storage devices to provide UP and DOWN events for any recovery actions that are identified as necessary by the monitoring application.

## Point-of-contact status

The point-of-contact is marked UP when the first packet of any type is received in the interface. The point-of-contact is marked down when no communication packets are received for the node down period of time.

CAA monitors both the communication interface states and the points-of-contact between nodes on a node-by-node basis (Example 2-26).

Monitoring: The ability to monitor this particular condition is important. An interface in the UP state and a point-of-contact in a down state can occur because of the hardware or other network issues between these particular nodes.

## 2.4  CAA daemons

When CAA is active, the following daemon services run as shown in Figure 2-23.

Figure 2-23 CAA services

| root@caa2 Subsystem   | / # lssrc -g caa Group   |     PID | Status   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------|----------|
| clcomd                | caa                      | 6553806 | active   |
| clconfd               | caa                      | 6619352 | active   |

CAA includes the following services:

- clcomd: This daemon is the cluster communications daemon, which changed in PowerHA 7.1. In previous versions of PowerHA, it was called clcomdES. The location of the rhosts file that PowerHA uses also changed. The rhosts file that is used by the clcomd service is in the /etc/cluster/rhosts file. The old clcomdES rhosts file in the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc directory is not used.
- clconfd: The clconfd subsystem runs on each node of the cluster. The clconfd daemon wakes up every 10 minutes to synchronize any necessary cluster changes.

Daemons: The solid and solidhac daemons are no longer used by CAA.

## 2.5  CAA multicast

Multicast consists of sending messages or information from the source to a group of hosts simultaneously in a single transmission. This communication uses network infrastructure efficiently. The source sends a packet only one time, even if it needs to be delivered to many receivers. The other nodes in the network replicate the packet to reach multiple receivers only when necessary.

CAA uses a multicast IP-based network communication mechanism to communicate between nodes in a cluster. A special ' gossip ' protocol is used to determine node information and implement scalable reliable multicast. For cluster communication, you can manually configure a multicast address or have CAA automatically select the multicast address.

## 2.5.1  Testing multicast in a network

Do not attempt to create a PowerHA cluster until you verify that multicast packets can be sent successfully across all nodes that are part of the PowerHA cluster.

To test end-to-end multicast communication across all nodes in your network, run the mping command to send and receive packets between nodes.

If you run PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1, or later, you cannot create a cluster if the mping command fails. If the mping command fails, your network is not set up correctly for multicast

communication. If your network is not set up correctly for multicast communication, review the documentation for your switches and routers to enable multicast communication.

You can run the mping command with a specific multicast address; otherwise, the command uses a default multicast address. You must use the multicast address that is used to create the cluster as input for the mping command (Figure 2-24).

```
Tip: To see this IP , use the lscluster -c command to display it.
```

Figure 2-24 mping command options

```
root@caa2 / # mping Usage: mping -r|-s [-v] [-a address] [-p port] [-t ttl] -r|-s Receiver or sender. Required argument, mutually exclusive -a address   Multicast address to listen/send on, overrides the default. (must be < 16 characters long) -p port      Multicast port to listen/send on, overrides the default of 4098. -t ttl Multicast Time-To-Live to send, overrides the default of 1. -v Verbose mode -c count     Count of packets to send/receive before quitting, default is to quit on receiving interrupt signal
```

Example 2-27 shows the mping command for the multicast address 228.1.1.34, where node A is the receiver and node B is the sender.

CAA selects a default multicast address if you do not specify a multicast address when you create the cluster. The default multicast address is created by combining the logical OR of the value (228.0.0.0) with the lower 24 bits of the IP address of the node as shown in Example 2-28.

```
if the node's IP address is 10.1.1.33, then the default multicast address would be 228.1.1.33 root@caa2 / # lscluster -i Network/Storage Interface Query Cluster Name:  caa_cl Cluster uuid:  cfd568b8-7207-11e1-9211-b6fcc11f846f Number of nodes reporting = 2 Number of nodes expected = 2 Node caa2 Node uuid = cf98b95e-7207-11e1-9211-b6fcc11f846f Number of interfaces discovered = 3 Interface number 1 en0 ifnet type = 6 ndd type = 7 Mac address length = 6 Mac address =  6e.8d.d5.65.89.6f Smoothed rrt across interface = 7 Mean Deviation in network rrt across interface = 3 Probe interval for interface = 100 ms ifnet flags for interface = 0x1e080863 ndd flags for interface = 0x21081b Interface state  UP Number of regular addresses configured on interface = 2 IPV4 ADDRESS: 172.16.21.33  broadcast 172.16.21.255  netmask 255.255.254.0 IPV4 ADDRESS: 10.1.1.33  broadcast 10.1.1.255  netmask 255.255.254.0 Number of cluster multicast addresses configured on interface = 1 IPV4 MULTICAST ADDRESS: 228.1.1.33 broadcast 0.0.0.0  netmask 0.0.0.0
```

Example 2-28   Default multicast address

## 2.5.2  Troubleshooting multicast

Use the mping command to test whether your nodes can send and receive multicast packets. If the mping command fails, you need to identify the problem in your network environment.

To troubleshoot multicast problems, review the following guidelines:

- Review the documentation for the switches that are used for multicast communication.

- Disable the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping on the switches that are used for multicast communication.
- Eliminate any cascaded switches between the nodes in the cluster. Have only a single switch between the nodes in the cluster.
- Verify that an entry exists in the routing table for the multicast IP address.

Troubleshooting: If your network infrastructure does not allow IGMP snooping to be disabled permanently, you might be able to troubleshoot problems by temporarily disabling snooping on the switches and then adding more network components one at a time.

Error: The mping command fails with the following message if there is no routing entry for the multicast address:

```
root@caa1 / # mping -r -a 228.1.1.34 mping version 1.1 setsockopt() failed: Can't assign requested address
```

## PowerHA 7.1.1 basic installation and configuration

This chapter describes step-by-step how to design and implement a PowerHA cluster.

We include the following topics:

- Introduction
- Designing your cluster
- Hardware requirements
- Important considerations for VIOS
- Networking
- Disk considerations
- PowerHA SystemMirror installation and prerequisites
- Configuring PowerHA SystemMirror topology
- Configuring PowerHA resources
- Configuring the application for PowerHA
- Dynamic LPAR and capacity on demand resources
- Test scenarios
- Troubleshooting

## 3.1  Introduction

We show you how to design, install, and configure a 2-node, mutual takeover PowerHA SystemMirror cluster. We focus on a typical, widely used cluster configuration, which covers the usual client requirements.

We produced a detailed, step-by-step installation guide, which is suitable for system administrators without prior clustering experience. We assume that you have a basic understanding of AIX and that you read Chapter 1, 'Introducing IBM PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1' on page 1.

Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) is the new underlying layer of PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. You do not need to be afraid of CAA. You do not have to deal directly with it. PowerHA commands take care of it. We use only one command to check the initial setup of the CAA cluster.

Figure 3-1 shows a typical, 2-node, mutual takeover PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 cluster.

Figure 3-1   Typical PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 cluster

<!-- image -->

## 3.1.1  Our sample cluster

We install a typical, 2-node, mutual takeover cluster.

We summarize what we know about our cluster configuration at the beginning of the design phase:

- We have a 2-node cluster.
- Application1 runs on the first node.
- Application2 runs on the second node.
- In a node failure, the application is recovered in the other node.
- We use a fully virtualized environment.

Next, we describe how to collect all required configuration data for the PowerHA implementation.

## 3.2  Designing your cluster

In the beginning of the design phase, usually limited information about our cluster configuration is available. You might know only the application and its basic requirements: required disk size, mount points, and the designated service IP address. Starting from this information, you can gradually collect all required data for the cluster configuration. Follow the steps to design and implement your own cluster.

Now, we show you the two most important design concepts of the PowerHA cluster:

- Avoid a single point of failure (SPOF).
- Keep it simple.

Important: Even with simple cluster designs, anyone who operates the cluster without adequate AIX and PowerHA skills often introduces downtime.

## 3.2.1  Avoid a single point of failure

When you implement a PowerHA cluster, ensure that there are no hardware or software components that are a single point of failure. Check all components of the installation for redundancy:

- The server has a redundant power supply that is connected to two independent electrical circuits.
- There are redundant fan modules or cooling in your server.
- The storage area network (SAN) consists of two fully independent networks.
- Use two network switches per server for redundant Ethernet connectivity.
- Mirror your system disks (rootvg).
- Have two Ethernet cards for each network.
- Have two SAN adapters for each node.
- Use a redundant power supply for the Ethernet and SAN switches.
- Use a redundant storage system.
- Use disk multipath I/O (MPIO).
- For the multiport adapters, ensure that you do not use different ports of the same adapter to access the same network.
- For further reducing the possible downtime, consider buying a server with hot-plug extension cards and disks.

You need the following components if you plan to use a Virtual I/O Server (VIOS):

- Two VIOS per frame
- Two Ethernet cards for each network on each VIOS
- Two SAN adapter cards on each VIOS

## 3.2.2 Keep it simple

Try to keep the PowerHA configuration as simple as possible. As you introduce more components, for example, networks and resource groups, your configuration becomes more tangled and requires more effort to keep it working. In most cases, the simple 2-node cluster with two resource groups is sufficient. It is rare that you need to configure more than two resource groups or more than two networks.

## 3.3  Hardware requirements

PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 can be installed on any hardware that is supported by AIX 6.1 TL7 SP2 or AIX 7.1 TL1 SP2. For supported IBM servers, extension cards, and storage subsystems, see the PowerHA hardware support matrix:

http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/TD105638

The 'Setting up cluster storage communication' page provides a list of supported Fibre Channel (FC) cards for SAN heartbeating:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.aix.clu steraware/claware\_comm\_setup.htm

Important: It is highly suggested but not technically mandatory that all cluster nodes are on different hardware servers.

PowerHA supports full system partitions as well as fully virtualized logical partitions (LPARs). You can use a mixture of physical and virtual interfaces, too. If you plan to use physical adapters, ensure that you have the required redundancy.

## 3.4  Important considerations for VIOS

PowerHA 7.1.1 supports a virtualized environment. For example, you can use virtual Ethernet, virtual SCSI disks, and FC N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV).

The PowerHA is indifferent to the device that you use: a real hardware device or virtual adapter. However, there are important considerations about using VIOS:

- Have two VIOS on each frame for redundancy.
- Configure Shared Ethernet Adapter (SEA) failover or network interface backup in the VIOS.
- You have to configure the netmon.cf file to check the status of the network behind the virtual switch.
- Have two independent Ethernet switches for fully redundant network access.
- Configure MPIO for disk access for the VIOS.
- Configure MPIO for disk access for the PowerHA LPAR.

This configuration is common for all virtualized environments so you use these features on your server anyway. Before you start installing and configuring the PowerHA cluster, check and test that the VIOSs, SEA failover, and MPIO work correctly.

For further information about VIOS configuration, see IBM PowerVM Virtualization Introduction and Configuration , SG24-7940.

## 3.4.1  Virtual Ethernet: SEA failover, network interface backup, and the number of virtual Ethernet adapters

During the developing of this book, we repeatedly asked 'What is the suggested virtual Ethernet configuration?' The authors all had their own opinions, and there were many long debates on this topic. Finally, we agreed that there is no specific or suggested virtual Ethernet configuration because all redundant configurations work well in a PowerHA environment.

We suggest the following virtual Ethernet configuration:

- Two VIOSs per physical server.
- Use the servers that are already configured virtual Ethernet settings because no special modification is required. For a VLAN-tagged network, the preferred solution is to use SEA failover; otherwise, use the network interface backup.
- One client-side virtual Ethernet interface simplifies the configuration; however, PowerHA misses network events.
- Two virtual Ethernet interfaces need to be on the cluster LPAR to enable PowerHA to receive the network events. This configuration results in a more stable cluster.

Important: The VIOS provides Ethernet network redundancy by using the SEA failover or Network Interface Backup (NIB) feature. However, the SEA failover and the NIB do not check the reachability of the specified ping address through the backup interface if the primary interface is up and running. So, you do not know that your backup path is working until the primary interface fails.

You might want two Ethernet interfaces in the cluster LPARs so that PowerHA can track the network changes, similar to physical network cards. Ensure that the two virtual Ethernet cards use different SEAs, VIOSs, and virtual Ethernet switches as their primary path.

In the following section, we describe some of the possible virtual Ethernet solutions and their properties. The only common component in the following configurations is the dual VIOSs.

## Two Ethernet adapters in the PowerHA network (no SEA failover or NIB)

Figure 3-2 on page 78 shows the simplest configuration: two virtual Ethernet adapters without SEA failover or NIB:

- No SEA failover or NIB, which is easy to configure on the VIOS side.
- Two virtual Ethernet adapters per PowerHA network.
- Redundancy that is provided by PowerHA.
- Similar to the traditional, dual physical adapter configuration.
- If the VIOS is down, the PowerHA network interface swap happens in the cluster.

Figure 3-2   Configuration with two virtual Ethernet adapters without SEA failover or NIB

<!-- image -->

## NIB and a single Ethernet adapter in PowerHA network

The following characteristics apply to this scenario:

- NIB provides load balancing across the VIOS.
- This scenario can be used only when there is no VLAN tagging on the network.
- Redundancy is provided by the NIB EtherChannel active-backup setting.
- Only one Ethernet adapter is allowed per PowerHA network.
- PowerHA cannot see the network events.

See Figure 3-3 on page 79 for the design of the simple NIB configuration.

Figure 3-3   Simple NIB configuration

<!-- image -->

## NIB and two Ethernet adapters per PowerHA network

See Figure 3-4 on page 80 for the dual virtual Ethernet NIB configuration with the following characteristics:

- NIB provides load balancing across the VIOSs.
- This scenario can be used only when there is no VLAN tagging on the network.
- Two Ethernet adapters are required per PowerHA network.
- Two virtual switches are required.
- Double redundancy: PowerHA and NIB EtherChannel exist.
- PowerHA can track the network events.

Figure 3-4   NIB with dual Ethernet adapters on the client LPAR

<!-- image -->

## SEA failover and one virtual Ethernet adapter on the client side

Figure 3-5 on page 81 shows the simple SEA failover configuration, which has these characteristics:

- It works with VLAN tagging.
- SEA shared mode provides load sharing between VLANs.
- When you use SEA shared mode, the default path might change after every reboot.
- Only one virtual Ethernet adapter exists per network.
- Redundancy is provided by SEA failover.
- PowerHA cannot track the network events.

Figure 3-5   Simple SEA failover configuration

<!-- image -->

## SEA failover with two virtual Ethernet interfaces in the cluster LPAR

This configuration has the following characteristics:

- There are two virtual switches.
- Each virtual adapter connects to its own virtual switch and SEAs - no common devices.
- It works with VLAN tagging.
- SEA shared mode provides load sharing between VLANs.
- When you use SEA shared mode, the default path can change after every reboot.
- Two virtual Ethernet adapters exist per network.
- Dual redundancy is available with SEA failover and PowerHA.
- PowerHA tracks the network events.

Figure 3-6 on page 82 shows a drawing of the SEA failover with the virtual Ethernet interfaces in the cluster LPAR.

Figure 3-6   SEA failover with two virtual Ethernet adapters on the client side

<!-- image -->

## 3.4.2  Our sample cluster virtual environment

Figure 3-7 on page 83 shows our sample configuration, a typical redundant VIOS environment. All components are duplicated on the VIOS and client LPAR level, too. We have two, fully redundant Ethernet networks that are connected to the same subnet or VLAN. One network consists of one physical adapter on each VIOS, one dedicated virtual switch, and the corresponding SEA and virtual adapters. Thus, there are no single points of failure.

Figure 3-7   Redundant VIOS environment of our sample cluster

<!-- image -->

Under normal circumstances, the first network connects through VIOS 1, and the second network uses VIOS 2. If an Ethernet switch fails or a VIOS fails, the Shared Ethernet failover ensures that both connections remain online through the second switch or VIOS.

For rootvg, we use Virtual SCSI disks. For data disk access, we choose NPIV. Both solutions provide multipath capability through two VIOSs for the client LPARs. Therefore, a controller, VIOS, or SAN switch failure does not affect our system.

## 3.5  Networking

Networking is the most challenging part of the PowerHA configuration. First, we clarify the following PowerHA networking terms.

PowerHA uses two network types:

- IP network: Ethernet network for user external access
- Non-IP network: SAN-based heartbeat communication and disk heartbeat through the repository disk

PowerHA has two types of network functions:

- Service network: For normal user communication
- Private network: For Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) internal communication

The PowerHA network configuration (Figure 3-8) has the following network interfaces and functions:

- One or more service addresses
- One persistent address for each node (optional)
- One or two base addresses for each network that is protected by PowerHA

Figure 3-8   Typical cluster network topology

<!-- image -->

Figure 3-8 shows the typical PowerHA cluster network topology. For better viewing and understanding, we omitted the VIOS and its components.

Important: The network must able to handle multiple IP addresses on the adapters. The same IP address can appear on different Ethernet cards and servers with a Media Access Control (MAC) address, which, on a typical network environment, is not a problem.

In the following section, we show the function of all interfaces and how to choose the correct IP address for them.

## 3.5.1  PowerHA network

A PowerHA network is a collection of interfaces and IP addresses that connect to the same 'physical' network or VLAN.

On each node, a traditional PowerHA network configuration consists of the following components:

- Two Ethernet adapter cards with their base IP addresses
- One optional persistent address: An IP alias that is in one of the base adapters
- A service address: An IP alias that is in one of the base adapters

See Figure 3-8 on page 84 for a graphical representation of the PowerHA network components.

## 3.5.2  Number of Ethernet adapters per node per network

Although you can create a cluster with only one Ethernet adapter per service network per node, we highly suggest that you have two adapter cards for each network on each node. We recognized that the cluster topology and network error detection and correction works better with the dual-adapter configuration.

## Physical network adapters

If you use physical network adapters, always use two adapter cards per node for each PowerHA network. Otherwise, you lose the swap adapter functionality, so a single network error starts a resource group takeover and application outage.

## Virtual Ethernet

Even if you use a fully virtualized environment with SEA failover, we advise that you have two virtual Ethernet adapters for each node. For our suggested virtual Ethernet configuration, see 3.4.1, 'Virtual Ethernet: SEA failover, network interface backup, and the number of virtual Ethernet adapters' on page 77.

## EtherChannel interfaces

PowerHA supports EtherChannel interfaces as the base adapter. However, try to avoid the use of EtherChannel in Active-Backup mode because PowerHA misses all network connectivity-related events. The EtherChannel protocol does not check the status of the backup adapter if the primary link is active. Another disadvantage is that you might have to use the same switch for both adapters. So, if you have two network cards, we advise that you configure them as base adapters for PowerHA and not use EtherChannel in Active-Backup mode.

We advise that you use 802.3AD link aggregation for higher network bandwidth requirements and for load balancing between the network cards. If possible, have a third interface as a secondary base adapter in PowerHA.

Figure 3-9 Suggested EtherChannel configuration for PowerHA cluster

<!-- image -->

Figure 3-9 shows the suggested EtherChannel configuration for the PowerHA cluster. We have three network cards (ent0, ent1, and ent2). Ent0 and ent1 are used for 802.3AD link aggregation. The EtherChannel interface is ent3, and we use ent3 as a base adapter in the cluster configuration. We can configure the persistent IP and the service IP address to be on this adapter, by default. The ent2 interface is used as a base interface too in a total EtherChannel failure or network switch failure. Then, the service address is relocated here.

## 3.5.3  Service network

The service network is used for external user communication. All of its interfaces are used for heartbeating; PowerHA constantly monitors their status. The Ethernet network is the service network, by default.

## 3.5.4  Private network

The private network is reintroduced in PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. It is used for Oracle interconnect purposes only. No other external or user traffic is allowed to use it. There is no heartbeating or any PowerHA related communication on it. The private adapters are listed in the /etc/cluster/ifrestrict file. Y ou cannot mark the interface private that has the host name.

## 3.5.5  Service address

The application users use the service IP address to connect to the service by the name: service address. This IP address is configured in a resource group and PowerHA brings it up and down with the corresponding application. In a takeover, this address is relocated to the secondary or backup node. If PowerHA is down, this address is down, too.

The service address is an IP alias that is in one of the base network interfaces. This address must be in the normal company data room network range and must be accessible from the outside network.

## 3.5.6  Persistent address

When the PowerHA services are down, or the application resource group is on the other node, we cannot use the service address for login. The persistent address is an IP alias, which is permanently connected to one of the base addresses of a node. It is always on the node. PowerHA does not move or change this address in a takeover or node that is down. This address can be used to distinguish a node. The persistent address is used to log on to the server during installation, when the PowerHA service address is down or when you want to connect to a certain node. This interface is used by the system administrators only; users never log on through it. We advise that the persistent IP address is in the same IP subnet with the service address.

Tip: If you have the boot IP in the same subnet as the service IP , you can configure a default gateway or static routes without a persistent address.

## 3.5.7 Base addresses

Because PowerHA uses IP aliases for the service and persistent addresses, there must be an IP address that is associated with the network interface cards (NICs). This IP address is the base address. Each network that is defined in the PowerHA topology has one or (preferably) two NICs (physical or virtual). Each card has its own base IP address in a different IP subnet. The base IP address is used for CAA heartbeating only; there is no incoming or outgoing external connection for the base IP address. We advise you to use non-routable IP subnets for the base address.

## 3.5.8  Why use different subnets for the two base IP addresses

Because of TCP/IP routing rules, if an AIX server is connected to the same IP subnet by more than one network interface only, the first interface is used for outgoing packets. Both interfaces can receive packets. Figure 3-10 shows an AIX server that is connected to same subnet by using two interfaces.

Figure 3-10   AIX server that is connected to same subnet by using two interfaces

<!-- image -->

Figure 3-10 on page 87 shows that when we address the second interface from an outside address, the TCP/IP packets are received on the second interface. But, the reply packet always uses the first interface as a source address. So, PowerHA is not able to verify the full functionality of the network cards.

In the preferred dual-network card PowerHA configuration, the service and persistent address must be in a separate IP subnet because they are on top of the base addresses.

## 3.5.9  Hostname and node name

Unlike earlier versions, now PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 has strict rules for which interface can be the hostname due to the new CAA layer requirements.

## Important:

- The hostname cannot be an alias in the /etc/hosts file.
- The name resolution for the hostname must work for both ways, therefore a limited set of characters can be used.
- The IP address that belongs to the hostname must be reachable on the server, even when PowerHA is down.
- The hostname cannot be a service address.
- The hostname cannot be an address located on a network which is defined as private in PowerHA.
- The hostname, the CAA node name, and the 'communication path to a node' must be the same.
- By default, the PowerHA, nodename, the CAA nodename, and the 'communication path to a node' are set to the same name.
- The hostname and the PowerHA nodename can be different.
- The hostname cannot be changed after the cluster configuration.

The rules leave the base addresses and the persistent address as candidates for the hostname. You can use the persistent address as the hostname only if you set up the persistent alias manually before you configure the cluster topology.

On the Domain Name System (DNS) server, you can specify any 'external' name for the service addresses so that the clients can use this name when they connect to the application that runs in the cluster.

See our sample cluster hostname configuration in 3.7.5, 'Setting up the hostname' on page 96.

Note: We could not configure a PowerHA 7.1.1 cluster because of a mismatch in the way the hostname was used. The hostname was defined using lowercase characters but in the /etc/hosts file it was written using uppercase. All the default TCP/IP commands worked fine. But the cluster setup failed. We updated the hosts file and then cluster setup worked fine.

## 3.5.10 IP subnet rules

We summarize the IP subnet rules for PowerHA SystemMirror.

## Important:

- The two base IP address pairs for a specific physical network must be on separate subnets.
- All service and persistent addresses must be on a separate subnet from any of the base subnets.
- The service IP addresses can all be in the same or different subnets.
- The base addresses and the corresponding persistent and service addresses must have the same subnet mask.
- The persistent IP address can be in the same or a different subnet from the service IP addresses.
- If you use separate subnets for the persistent and the service IP addresses, be aware of the TCP/IP routing issues.
- If you have a single adapter network configuration, both the base and service addresses are allowed on the same subnet.

To clarify this concept, here is our sample cluster network configuration:

- We use one IP network with two virtual Ethernet network interfaces per node. We use two service IP addresses (one for each application) from the company data room network, which is 172.16.20.0/23. We know that our service IP address for application1 is 172.16.21.67, and for application2 is 172.16.21.72. The netmask is 255.255.254.0 and the default gateway is 172.16.20.1.
- Now, we need two persistent addresses. They must be in the same subnet with the service IP . Our persistent addresses are 172.16.21.39 and 172.16.21.47. The corresponding netmask is 255.255.254.0.
- We have two Ethernet interfaces on each node as a base adapter. We selected two subnets that are not used elsewhere in the company network and the routers do not forward them. These networks are 10.1.0.0/23 and 10.10.0.0/23. The first pair of interfaces (one from each node) uses the 10.1.1.39 and 10.1.1.47 addresses. The other two interfaces use the 10.10.1.39 and 10.10.1.47 addresses. Because our company data room network has a 255.255.254.0 subnet mask, we use the same subnet mask on the base adapters, too.

## 3.5.11  Multicast heartbeat

PowerHA uses multicast addressing for heartbeating. Therefore, the network infrastructure must correctly handle the multicast traffic (check the multicast configuration with your network administrator):

- Enable multicast traffic on all switches that are used by the cluster nodes.
- Check the available multicast traffic IP address allocation.
- Ensure that the multicast traffic is correctly forwarded by the network infrastructure (firewalls and routers) between the cluster nodes.

The multicast address is generated automatically the first time that the cluster is synchronized. The CAA changes the first octet of the base address to 228 to create the multicast address:

base address: x.y.z.t multicast address: 228.y.z.t

Alternatively, you can specify your multicast address during the cluster installation. For more information about the multicast heartbeat, see 2.5, 'CAA multicast' on page 68.

## 3.5.12  Netmon.cf file

There are changes in PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 on the use of the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf file:

- If you plan to use a network with one physical adapter (not virtual) per node, you do not need to use the netmon.cf file any more.
- If you use virtual Ethernet in your cluster, you must configure netmon.cf .

## 3.5.13 Netmon.cf file configuration for virtual Ethernet environment

Important: This configuration requires APAR IV14422.

When the cluster nodes have virtual Ethernet adapters, the correct configuration of the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf file is required for PowerHA to monitor the status of the network outside of the virtual switch.

In the virtual Ethernet configuration, the LPARs are connected to a virtual switch that hides the underlying physical adapters and VIOS components from the client LPARs. When the VIOS network cables are unplugged, the virtual switch remains intact, up, and running inside the frame. The LPAR clients cannot recognize the external network failure without knowing the entire network topology.

If something happens to the VIOS physical network interfaces or SEAs, the Virtual IO clients are not notified; therefore, PowerHA does not know the status of the external network. For example, when all network cables are removed from the VIOS, PowerHA is not notified of the network failure and does not run any event.

## 3.5.14  Firewalls

Do not put firewalls between the cluster nodes. If you use a firewall, you must open the firewall for the persistent and service addresses. The firewall must handle the IP address changes and relocations in the cluster.

Optionally, you can define a permanent source address of the outgoing traffic. For more details, see 3.9.2, 'Configuring the service IP address distribution preference' on page 123. In this case, when the cluster is up and running, all outbound TCP/IP packets have the predefined source address.

## Changing PowerHA networks

To change network behavior, you can use smitty sysmirror command and go through Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage Networks and Network Interfaces  Networks  Change/Show a Network . Then, select the network for which you want to change the Network attribute configuration , as shown in Figure 3-11.

Figure 3-11   Cluster network configuration

<!-- image -->

## 3.6  Disk considerations

For data disks, there is no practical limitation in PowerHA SystemMirror.

## 3.6.1  Repository disk

PowerHA stores the CAA cluster configuration on a designated disk, which is called the repository disk . This disk is shared between the cluster nodes; therefore, it must support concurrent access. The repository disk size must be 512 MB - 460 GB. For a 2-node cluster, about 1 GB of disk space is sufficient.

Important: The repository disk cannot be mirrored by using AIX Logical Volume Manager (LVM) mirror. Ensure that the repository disk is a hardware RAID-1 or RAID-5 protected logical unit number (LUN).

PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 now supports EMC, Hitachi, and HP storage for repository disks. For the supported storage subsystems, see the PowerHA hardware support matrix:

In this section, we perform the actual installation steps for our sample PowerHA cluster. Our sample cluster has fully virtualized nodes; however, the same procedure applies to a cluster with physical Ethernet and FC adapters.

We provide a detailed step-by-step configuration that is easy to follow. We advise you to double-check every step to avoid any configuration errors.

## 3.7.1  Our sample cluster

Figure 3-12 on page 92 displays the detailed configuration for our sample cluster.

## Application and resource group configuration

We have two applications, app1 and app2, in a mutual takeover configuration. Each application has a service IP address (instsvc1 and instsvc2), a volume group (app1vg, app2vg), and a file system ( /data1 and /data2 ). The cluster consists of two resource groups, one for each application. The resource groups are named inst1rg and inst2rg. The resource groups contain the application, related volume groups, file systems, and service IP addresses.

Figure 3-12   Our sample cluster configuration

<!-- image -->

## Network configuration

Our main service network is 172.16.20.0/23 and the default gateway is 172.16.20.1. This network is used for application client communication. We configure a persistent and service IP for each node from this subnet. The persistent IP label is the hostname.

The base IP ranges are 10.1.0.0/23 and 10.10.0.0/23. These subnets are not used anywhere else in our company network; the routers do not forward them.

Table 3-1 summarizes the service network IP configuration for our sample cluster. We use the default net\_ether\_01 name for this service network in the cluster configuration.

Table 3-1   IP addresses that are used by our sample cluster

| Function   | Node1 IP address   | Node1 IP label   | Node2 IP address   | Node2 IP label   |
|------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| service    | 172.16.21.67       | instsvc1         | 172.16.21.72       | instsvc2         |
| persistent | 172.16.21.39       | inst1            | 172.16.21.47       | inst2            |
| base 1     | 10.1.1.39          | inst1b1          | 10.1.1.47          | inst2b1          |
| base 2     | 10.10.1.39         | inst1b2          | 10.10.1.47         | inst2b2          |

We use the persistent IP labels for the hostname and node name, which are bold in the table.

We have an additional network in our servers, which is used for accessing the Tivoli Storage Manager backup servers only. The network is configured in the PowerHA topology as net\_ether\_02 . However, there is no service address for that network; therefore, we do not configure this network as part of a resource group. PowerHA does not protect this network. Table 3-2 shows the backup network IP settings.

Table 3-2   Backup network IP configuration

| Function   | Node1 IP address   | Node 1 IP label   | Node2 IP address   | Node2 IP label   |
|------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| base       | 10.1.2.39          | inst1backup       | 10.1.2.47          | inst2backup      |

We advise you to create a similar network configuration table for your cluster.

## Hardware configuration

We use two IBM Power 750 servers. We have two VIOSs on each system. The VIOSs are connected to our Ethernet network by two adapter cards. For SAN connectivity, we use two Fibre Channel (FC) adapters per VIOS. All LPARs are fully virtualized with virtual Ethernet and FC adapters.

## Virtual I/O Server configuration

Our servers have the following VIOS configuration:

- Two VIOSs on each server
- SEA failover for all Ethernet interfaces
- Virtual SCSI disks for rootvg
- NPIV port virtualization for SAN connectivity

For the detailed VIOS configuration, see 3.4.2, 'Our sample cluster virtual environment' on page 82.

## 3.7.2  Starting point for the installation

For the start of the PowerHA SystemMirror installation, we assume that you have the following environment:

- Two servers
- Fully working and tested redundant VIOS configuration
- Ethernet connectivity and outside network access that works well
- Storage access, including SAN zones and LUN mapping
- Two installed AIX 7.1 LPARs
- No IP that is configured on the LPARs

- No default gateway that is set
- Mirrored rootvg

We advise you to hardcode the host name into the PS1 environment variable (Example 3-1) for the root and other administrative users so the system administrators always see from the prompt on which cluster node they are signed up. We know of several cases when the system administrator stopped the wrong cluster node.

Example 3-1   Setting up PS1 environment variable for the root user

inst1:/# cat .profile export PS1='inst1:$PWD#'

set -o vi

## 3.7.3  Base adapter network setup

First, we must configure the network settings for the base adapters. You have to log on through the Hardware Management Console (HMC) virtual terminal session because we are going to change the IP addresses. Identify your network adapters, and then use smit mktcpip to configure the two base adapters on both cluster nodes. Select the interface that you want and enter the TCP/IP parameters. Do not set your default gateway yet. See Figure 3-13 to set up the base address.

## 3.7.4 Persistent IP and default gateway setup

To log on to the cluster nodes through the company network, we must configure the persistent addresses on the LPARs. Enter smit inetalias . Click Add an IPV4 Network Alias . Select one of the base interfaces, and enter the persistent IP address and the corresponding netmask. Figure 3-14 on page 95 shows how to configure an IPV4 alias for a persistent address.

Figure 3-14 Configuring the IP alias for the persistent address

<!-- image -->

Now, configure your default gateway. Start smitty mktcpip , select any of the base interfaces, and fill out the default gateway entry field (see Figure 3-15). Set the persistent address IP label to your hostname.

Figure 3-15   Configuring the default gateway

<!-- image -->

Log on to your cluster nodes from the company network.

## 3.7.5  Setting up the hostname

CAA has strict rules for hostname conventions.

Important: Unlike in earlier versions of PowerHA, the hostname must not be an alias in the /etc/hosts file. The name resolution for the hostname must work for both ways, therefore a limited set of characters can be used. The IP address that belongs to the hostname must be reachable on the server:

- The hostname cannot be a service address.
- The hostname cannot be an alias in the /etc/hosts file.
- The hostname cannot be an address located on a network which is defined as private in PowerHA.
- The hostname, the CAA node name, and the 'communication path to a node' must be the same.
- By default, the PowerHA, nodename, the CAA nodename, and the 'communication path to a node' are set to the same name (see 3.8.3, 'Initial cluster setup' on page 114).
- The hostname of the cluster nodes cannot change after the cluster is configured.

We advise you to use one of the base addresses or the persistent address as the hostname. You can use the persistent address as the hostname only if you set up the persistent alias manually before you configure the cluster topology.

We use the persistent IP labels for hostname and node name, inst1 and inst2.

## 3.7.6  Preparing the /etc/hosts file and changing the name resolution order

This area is the most problematic part of the cluster configuration. If your /etc/hosts file is incorrect, you cannot define your PowerHA cluster. Now, you know the cluster topology, networks, and all IP labels. During the node discovery, PowerHA reads the /etc/hosts file and compiles a list of IP labels. You must prepare the /etc/hosts file so that you can select the correct IP labels with the SMIT dialogs during the cluster configuration.

## Important:

- All IP labels that are used by the PowerHA cluster must be resolvable.
- Do not use aliases in the /etc/hosts file because of CAA considerations.
- The cluster IP addresses and IP labels must be the same on all cluster nodes.

Example 3-2 displays the /etc/hosts file on our PowerHA cluster. Our hostnames are inst1 and inst2 , and they are configured as the persistent addresses.

Example 3-2   /etc/hosts file for the cluster

```
#Base IP addresses (10.1.0.0/23) 10.1.1.39       inst1b1 10.1.1.47       inst2b1 #Base IP addresses (10.10.0.0/23) 10.10.1.39      inst1b2 10.10.1.47      inst2b2 #Persistent IP Addresses (172.16.20.0/23) 172.16.21.39 inst1 172.16.21.47 inst2
```

#Service IP Addresses (172.16.20.0/23)

172.16.21.67    instsvc1

172.16.21.72    instsvc2

#Backup network IP addresses (10.1.2.0/24)

10.1.2.39       inst1backup

10.1.2.47       inst2backup

If you use a nameserver, we strongly advise that you change the name resolution order in the /etc/netsvc.conf file:

hosts=local,bind

Therefore, AIX looks for an IP label/IP address in the local /etc/hosts file first, and then in the nameserver that is defined in /etc/resolv.conf file.

## 3.7.7  Check your network settings

Before you continue, double-check the network settings. From our experience, the wrong network configuration is the most common source of PowerHA configuration problems. Example 3-3 shows how to check your network settings.

Example 3-3   Checking the network settings

```

Ensure that the network connectivity works:

- Log on to the nodes from the company network by using the persistent address.
- Ping the base adapter pairs.
- Ping or access the default gateway.
- Ensure that name resolution works for the hostname, all IP labels, and addresses that are used in the cluster configuration.

## 3.7.8  Time synchronization

We suggest that you use time synchronization on the cluster nodes. Some applications require time synchronization, but by running xntpd , the cluster administration and debugging are easier.

## Configuring NTP clients

If your network already has an established time server, you can set up the cluster nodes to get the accurate time information from it:

- 1.
- Modify the /etc/ntp.conf file to contain these lines: server 192.169.1.254 # your ntp time server's IP address goes here driftfile /etc/ntp.drift tracefile /etc/ntp.trace
2. Start the xntpd daemon: startsrc -s xntpd
3. Set up xntpd to start automatically at boot time. Remove the comment mark from the beginning of the line in the /etc/rc.tcpip file:

```
start /usr/sbin/xntpd '$src_running'
```

## Setting up a time server

If you do not have a time server, you can easily set up a time server in the cluster. Without external time information, the time of the servers is not accurate, but identical. Follow these steps:

1. Choose one of the nodes to act as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, preferably the node with the highest priority in the cluster.
2. Modify the /etc/ntp.conf file on the NTP server:
3. Edit the /etc/ntp.conf file on the other nodes:

```
disable auth server 127.127.1.1 prefer # use the local clock as preferred fudge 127.127.1.1 stratum 4 driftfile /etc/ntp.drift
```

server 10.10.1.1 # your cluster's ntp time server's base IP address goes here driftfile /etc/ntp.drift

tracefile /etc/ntp.trace

We suggest that you use the NTP server node base address or a persistent interface, if any.

4. Edit the /etc/rc.tcpip file on all nodes so that xntpd starts automatically:

start /usr/sbin/xntpd '$src\_running'

5. Start xntpd on all nodes:

startsrc -s xntpd

## 3.7.9  Installing the AIX prerequisites

Install the following filesets from the AIX media:

bos.adt

bos.ahafs

bos.cluster

bos.clvm

bos.net.tcp.client

bos.net.tcp.server

devices.common.IBM.storfwork.rte

rsct.basic.rte

rsct.compat.basic.hacmp

rsct.compat.client.hacmp

If you plan to use Network File System (NFS), you must install the NFS client and server packages, too:

bos.net.nfs.client

bos.net.nfs.server

For the optional message authentication and encryption communication between the cluster nodes, install one of the following packages from the AIX Expansion Pack media:

- rsct.crypt.des - For Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- rsct.crypt.aes256 - For Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- rsct.crypt.3des - For Triple DES

## 3.7.10  Installing the latest AIX fixes

This point is the best time to install the latest AIX fixes. Y ou can download them from IBM FixCentral:

http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/

Also, remember to download the latest PowerHA fixes. We install them later. After you apply the AIX fixes, reboot the servers.

Important: If you plan to use virtual Ethernet adapters in the cluster, install APAR IV14422.

## 3.7.11  Setting up the required SAN zones for SAN-based heartbeat

We must set up an additional SAN zoning that is required for the SAN-based heartbeat. We need to add a zone that contains all SAN adapters of the cluster nodes in the fabric so that they can access each other.

## Important:

- If you use physical FC adapters, you must zone together that cards' worldwide name (WWN).
- If you use virtual FC adapters, you must to zone together the physical adapters' WWN from the VIOSs.

Example 3-4 shows how to query the WWNs of the FC cards. In this case, the cards are physical FC adapters on a cluster node.

```
root@inst1 / # lscfg -vpl fcs0|grep Network Network Address.............1050760506190014 root@inst1 / # lscfg -vpl fcs1|grep Network Network Address.............1050760506190015 -------------------------------------------------------------root@inst2 / # lscfg -vpl fcs0|grep Network Network Address.............10507605061A0078 root@inst2 / # lscfg -vpl fcs1|grep Network Network Address.............10507605061A0079
```

Example 3-4   Listing the WWN addresses of the FC cards

If you use virtual FC adapters, you have to use the physical adapters on the VIOS. Example 3-5 shows how to display the WWN addresses of the FC cards on the VIOSs.

```
$ lsdev -dev fcs0 -vpd | grep Network Network Address.............10000000C9E331E8 $ lsdev -vpd -dev fcs1 |grep Network Network Address.............10000000C9E331E9
```

Example 3-5   Displaying the WWN addresses of the FC cards on the VIOSs

Example 3-6 illustrates the required zones on the SAN switches for a 2-physical card configuration.

```
Fabric1:
```

Example 3-6   The required SAN zones

```

```

## 3.7.12  Configuring the physical FC adapters for SAN-based heartbeat

We describe how to configure SAN-based heartbeat for physical FC adapters. If you use virtual FC adapters (NPIV), see 3.7.13, 'Configuring SAN heartbeating in a virtual environment' on page 103.

You can configure SAN-based heartbeat only if you have one of the supported FC adapters. For more information, see the 'Setting up cluster storage communication' page:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.aix.clu steraware/claware\_comm\_setup.htm

To correctly configure the FC adapters for the cluster SAN-based communication, follow these steps:

X in fcsX: In the following steps, the X in fcsX represents the number of the FC adapters. You must complete this procedure for each FC adapter that is involved in the cluster SAN-based communication.

1. Change the tme attribute value to yes in the fcsX definition:

chdev -P -l fcsX -a tme=yes

2. Enable the dynamic tracking, and the fast-fail error recovery policy on the corresponding fscsiX device:

chdev -P -l fscsiX -a dyntrk=yes -a fc\_err\_recov=fast\_fail

3. Restart the server.
4. Verify the configuration changes by running the following commands:

```
lsdev -C | grep -e fcsX -e sfwcommX lsattr -El fcsX | grep tme lsattr -El fscsiX | grep -e dyntrk -e fc_err_recov
```

Example 3-7 illustrates the procedure for port fcs0 on node inst1.

```
inst1:/ # lsdev -l fcs0 fcs0 Available 00-00 8Gb PCI Express Dual Port FC Adapter (df1000f114108a03) sinst1:/ # lsattr -El fcs0|grep tme tme no         Target Mode Enabled                                True inst1:/ # rmdev -Rl fcs0 fcnet1 Defined sfwcomm0 Defined fscsi0 Defined fcs0 Defined inst1:/ # chdev -l fcs0 -a tme=yes fcs0 changed inst1:/ # chdev -l fscsi0 -a dyntrk=yes -a fc_err_recov=fast_fail fscsi0 changed inst1:/ # cfgmgr -l fcs0;cfgmgr -l sfwcomm0 inst1:/ # lsdev -C|grep -e fcs0 -e sfwcomm0 fcs0 Available 01-00       8Gb PCI Express Dual Port FC Adapter (df1000f114108a03) sfwcomm0   Available 01-00-02-FF Fibre Channel Storage Framework Comm
```

Example 3-7   SAN-based communication channel setup

```
inst1:/ # lsattr -El fcs0|grep tme tme yes        Target Mode Enabled True inst1:/ # lsattr -El fscsi0|grep -e dyntrk -e fc_err_recov dyntrk       yes       Dynamic Tracking of FC Devices        True fc_err_recov fast_fail FC Fabric Event Error RECOVERY Policy True
```

No other configuration is required in PowerHA. When your cluster is up and running, you can check the status of the SAN heartbeat with the lscluster -i sfwcom command. See Example 3-10 on page 105.

## 3.7.13 Configuring SAN heartbeating in a virtual environment

If you do not have a physical FC adapter that is assigned to the cluster LPARs, you still can use SAN heartbeating through the VIOSs. This solution does not require virtual FC adapters on the client LPARS, virtual SCSI clients can use it, too. Figure 3-16 on page 104 shows the SAN heartbeat configuration and data flow. For clarity, we omitted the second VIOS and the redundant VIOS components from both frames.

The client LPARs cannot use the FC adapters of the VIOSs directly for heartbeating. A number of forward devices (sfwcommX) and a special virtual Ethernet connection are needed between the LPARs and the VIOS. This connection requires a dedicated virtual Ethernet adapter with VLAN ID 3358 on the VIOSs and all cluster LPARs. The PowerHA underlying CAA cluster uses the sfwcomm VLAN Storage Framework Communication device to send the heartbeats. The heartbeats go through the virtual Ethernet switch. Then, the VIOS's sfwcomm device forwards it to the physical FC adapter and to the SAN network. To bypass AIX and the VIOS TCP/IP subsystem, sfwcomm devices use the Ethernet data link layer communication.

Figure 3-16   SAN heartbeating in a virtual environment

<!-- image -->

Important: To configure SAN-based heartbeating in a virtual environment, VIOS level 2.2.0.11-FP24SP01 or newer is required. You can download the latest version of VIOS from IBM Fix Central:

http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/

Follow these configuration steps:

1. Check that the FC adapter in the VIOS supports target mode. See the 'Setting up cluster storage communication' page for the supported FC adapters:
2. http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.aix. clusteraware/claware\_comm\_setup.htm
2. Configure the FC adapters for SAN heartbeating on the VIOSs:
4. chdev -dev fcs0 -attr tme=yes -perm
5. Repeat this step for all FC cards.
3. Reboot the VIO server.

Important: Repeat step 2 and 3 on all VIOSs serving the cluster LPARs.

4. On the HMC, create a new virtual Ethernet adapter for each cluster LPAR and VIOS. Set the VLAN ID to 3358. Do not put another VLAN ID or any other traffic to this network interface. Save the LPAR profile. For further information about how to create a virtual Ethernet interface for an LPAR on the HMC, see IBM PowerVM Virtualization Introduction and Configuration , SG24-7940.
5. You do not have to set up any IP address on the new virtual Ethernet interface.
6. On the VIOS, run cfgdev , and then check for the new Ethernet and sfwcomm devices with the lsdev command. See Example 3-8.
7. On the cluster nodes, run cfgmgr , and check for the virtual Ethernet and sfwcomm devices with the lsdev command (Example 3-9).
8. No other configuration is required in PowerHA. When your cluster is up and running, you can check the status of the SAN heartbeat with the lscluster -i sfwcom command (Example 3-10).

```
$ lsdev|grep sfw sfw0 Available   Storage Framework Module sfwcomm0         Available   Fibre Channel Storage Framework Comm sfwcomm1         Available   Fibre Channel Storage Framework Comm sfwcomm2         Available   SAS Storage Framework Comm sfwcomm3         Available   vLAN Storage Framework Comm
```

```
root@inst1 / # lsdev -C|grep sfw sfw0 Available             Storage Framework Module sfwcomm0       Available 81-T1-01-FF Fibre Channel Storage Framework Comm sfwcomm1       Available 82-T1-01-FF Fibre Channel Storage Framework Comm sfwcomm2       Available             vLAN Storage Framework Comm
```

```

## 3.7.14  Shared storage

Now, we explain the process of creating an enhanced concurrent volume group for the application data.

## Configuring the FC adapters

If dynamic tracking and the fast-fail error recovery policy are not enabled, enable the dynamic tracking and the fast-fail error recovery policy on the fscsi devices, and then, restart the server. This task applies to virtual FC adapters, too.

chdev -P -l fscsi0 -a dyntrk=yes -a fc\_err\_recov=fast\_fail

## Disabling the SCSI reservation

Important: You must disable the SCSI reservation locks for all shared cluster disks.

## Disabling the SCSI locks on the data disks on the storage subsystem

You must disable the SCSI locks for the data disks. If you use physical or virtual FC adapters to connect to the storage subsystem, you have to check this feature on the storage. However, on most storage systems, if you set the host type correctly, you do not have to do anything. For more information, see the storage documentation.

## Disabling the SCSI reservation locks on the VIOS

If your cluster uses data disks through a virtual SCSI adapter from a VIOS, disable the SCSI locks on the VIOS:

1. Log on to the VIOS and check the reserve policy for the hdisk that is used for the virtual SCSI backing device for the cluster nodes. Example 3-11 shows how to check the reserve policy for an hdisk.
2. Change the reserve policy for the virtual SCSI backing device:

Example 3-11   Checking the reserve policy for virtual SCSI backing disks

chdev -dev hdisk1 -attr reserve\_policy=no\_reserve

3. Repeat this step for all virtual SCSI backing disk devices on all VIOSs.

## Disabling SCSI locks for the data disks on the cluster nodes

You must check the reserve\_policy for all your cluster data and repository disks and change it to no\_reserve, if necessary. Example 3-12 shows how to change the reserve policy to no\_reserve .

Example 3-12   Checking and changing the reserve policy for a cluster data disk

root@inst1 / # lsattr -El hdisk4|grep reserve

reserve\_policy  single\_path      Reserve Policy             True

root@inst1 / # chdev -a reserve\_policy=no\_reserve -l hdisk4

## Configuring the hdisk Physical Volume ID on all cluster nodes

We advise you to set up the Physical Volume ID (PVID) on the cluster data and repository disks on all cluster nodes by using the commands that are shown in Example 3-13. This step speeds up the shared disk configuration process later because PowerHA identifies the disks by the PVID.

Example 3-13 Setting up the PVID for the cluster data and repository disks (first node)

Repeat the previous steps on the other cluster node so that we have the same PVIDs for the data disks (Example 3-14).

Example 3-14   Setting up the PVID for the cluster data and repository disks (second node)

| root@inst2   | / # lspv         |        |        |

| hdisk4       | 00f74d45367edf3b | None   |        |

## Creating data volume groups and file systems

Perform these steps on the primary node only. To create a scalable, enhanced concurrent access volume group from the data disks, use smit mkvg . Then, select Add a Scalable Volume Group . Figure 3-17 displays how to create a volume group.

Figure 3-17   Creating a scalable, enhanced concurrent volume group

<!-- image -->

Ensure that you supply a unique major number for each volume group. The available major numbers can differ on the cluster nodes. To get the list of the available major numbers, move the cursor to the Volume Group MAJOR NUMBER line and press F4 or issue the lvlstmajor command. Select a number that is available on all cluster nodes. A good starting number can be 100.

The major number represents the pointer to the device in the kernel. Normally, you are not concerned with this number, but PowerHA forces you to use the same major number for all volume groups in the cluster configuration.

Example 3-15 shows how to check a volume group major number.

Example 3-15   Checking a volume group major number

root@inst1 / # ls -al /dev/app1vg crw-rw----    1 root     system

100 , 0 Mar 21 14:49 /dev/app1vg

## Creating logical volumes and file systems

You have to issue the varyonvg app1vg command manually before you can start to create the logical volumes and file systems. Do not vary on the same volume group on the backup node. During logical volume and file system creation, ensure that you use unique names for the LVM components. If you plan to use separate journaled file system (JFS)/JFS2 log volumes, all volume groups must have their own log volume. We advise you to use an inline log for the JFS2 file systems. When you create a file system set 'Mount AUTOMATICALLY at system restart?' to no .

Alternatively, you can add your file systems later when the cluster is up and running by using smit cspoc . For information about how to manage the shared LVM components from PowerHA Cluster Single Point of Control (C-SPOC), see 4.15, 'C-SPOC cluster user and group management' on page 202.

## Importing the volume groups to the backup node

After you create the necessary logical volumes and file systems, you must import the volume group to the backup node:

- 1.
- Unmount the file systems and vary off the data volume groups on the primary node: varyoffvg app1vg
2. Identify the physical volume IDs of the data volume on both cluster nodes. See Example 3-16 and Example 3-17.
3. Import the volume group to the backup site: importvg -V major\_number -y volume\_group\_name -c physical\_volume . Example 3-18 shows how to use the importvg command.

Example 3-16 Identify the PVIDs of the app1vg volume group on the primary node

| inst1:/# lspv hdisk0   | 00f74d45f95e5beb   | rootvg   | active   |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------|----------|
| hdisk1                 | 00f74d45fa932b47   | rootvg   | active   |
| hdisk2                 | 00f74d45367ec638   | None     |          |
| hdisk3                 | 00f74d45367ed24c   | app1vg   |          |
| hdisk4                 | 00f74d45367edf3b   | app2vg   |          |

Example 3-17   Identify the PVID of the data volume group on the backup node

| root@inst2   | # lspv           |        |        |
|--------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| hdisk0       | 00f74d47f96263a2 | rootvg | active |
| hdisk1       | 00f74d47fa934fef | rootvg | active |
| hdisk2       | 00f74d45367ec638 | None   |        |
| hdisk3       | 00f74d45367ed24c | None   |        |
| hdisk4       | 00f74d45367edf3b | None   |        |

Example 3-18   Importing a data volume group to the secondary node

```
root@inst2 / # importvg -V 100 -y app1vg -c hdisk3 app1vg 0516-783 importvg: This imported volume group is concurrent capable. Therefore, the volume group must be varied on manually.
```

Ensure that you use the same major number that you use on the primary node.

## Converting an existing volume group to an enhanced concurrent volume group

If data volume groups are already created, you can change them to enhanced concurrent capable: run smit chvg , then press F4, and select the volume group. Set the volume group type to enhanced concurrent and disable the automatic activation. For information to change a volume group to enhanced concurrent, see Figure 3-18 on page 110.

Important: PowerHA 7.1 supports shared VGs of type enhanced concurrent only (unlike previous PowerHA versions).

```

Figure 3-18   Changing an existing volume group to the enhanced concurrent type

Now, you can import the volume group on the other node. Ensure that you use the same major number on both nodes. If the volume group has a major number that is already used on the other node, export and import the volume group on the primary node, too. Example 3-19 shows how you can synchronize the volume group major number between the cluster nodes.

```
Primary node: root@inst1 / # ls -al /dev/app2vg crw-rw----    1 root     system 33,  0 Mar 21 15:35 /dev/app2vg root@inst1 / # lvlstmajor 39..99,101... Backup node: root@inst2 / # lvlstmajor 35..99,101... Primary node: inst1:/# exportvg app2vg inst1:/# importvg -V 101 -y app2vg -c hdisk4 app2vg 0516-783 importvg: This imported volume group is concurrent capable.

## 3.7.16  Installing PowerHA fixes

Install the latest PowerHA fixes. You can download them from IBM FixCentral:

http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/

## 3.8  Configuring PowerHA SystemMirror topology

The PowerHA SystemMirror topology is the skeleton of the cluster. It describes the cluster networks and network interfaces. CAA always monitors all interfaces, no matter which ones are in the HA topology.

After you complete 3.7, 'PowerHA SystemMirror installation and prerequisites' on page 91, then you can proceed with the PowerHA SystemMirror configuration.

There are several ways to create and configure your cluster:

- SMIT: SMIT is the easiest and most convenient way to manage your cluster. We use this method in this section. Figure 3-19 displays the main SMIT menu for PowerHA SystemMirror ( smit sysmirror ).
- The clmgr command-line interface: New in PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1. You can perform all cluster management tasks with clmgr . This interface is an excellent tool to write scripts for large-scale deployments and daily cluster management tasks. See Appendix B, 'Configuring the PowerHA cluster by using clmgr' on page 551 for more information about clmgr usage.
- PowerHA SystemMirror plug-in for IBM System Director: This System Director plug-in provides a graphical user interface for cluster management.
- Web-based SMIT: A graphical, web-based SMIT for PowerHA menus only. You have to install the cluster.es.client.wsm fileset; however, we do not advise you to use this method.

Figure 3-19   SMIT PowerHA SystemMirror main menu

<!-- image -->

Important: The PowerHA SMIT windows have a new design since the earlier version. However, some help text and man pages still refer to the old version.

Familiarize yourself with the SMIT PowerHA menus. Some of the functions are not available until you set up the corresponding cluster objects. Press F1 anytime for context-sensitive help.

## 3.8.1 Propagating the /etc/cluster/rhosts file

The first step is to create and propagate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file on the nodes. Unlike in earlier version of PowerHA SystemMirror, now you have to manually edit this file. Follow these steps:

1. Create the /etc/cluster/rhosts file and write all IP addresses or IP labels from the cluster nodes into it. See Example 3-20 for our sample cluster rhosts file. We insert all base, persistent, and service addresses from both nodes.
2. Copy the file to all nodes.
3. Restart the clcomd daemon on all nodes: refresh -s clcomd .

```
root@inst1 / # cat /etc/cluster/rhosts 10.1.1.39 10.1.1.47 10.10.1.39 10.10.1.47 172.16.21.39 172.16.21.47 172.16.21.67 172.16.21.72
```

Example 3-20   /etc/cluster/rhosts file

## 3.8.2  Configuring the netmon.cf file

If you use virtual Ethernet adapters in the cluster, you have to create the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf file.

Important: This configuration requires APAR IV14422.

Select a good target IP address for each of your networks. We advise you to use the IP address of the default gateway, firewall, or any other fundamental device of your network. The address must answers for the ping requests.

Edit the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf file. The file format is shown:

!REQD base\_ip1 target\_IP1

!REQD persistent\_ip target\_IP3

!REQD base\_ip2 target\_IP2

Consider the following information as you edit this file:

- The first IP is always the monitored adapter; the second IP is the target that we want to ping.
- You can add as many lines as you want. If there are more than one entry for an adapter, PowerHA tries to ping all of them. If at least one target replies, the interface is marked 'good'.
- Ensure that you add at least one line for each base adapter. It is suggested to add a ping target for your persistent addresses.
- The file can be different on the nodes.

You can see our nemton.cf files from our sample cluster nodes in Example 3-21. We use the default gateway as our target IP address for the persistent IP . Because the IP addresses on the base interfaces cannot access the default gateway, we use another PowerHA host IP for their target.

```
root@inst1 / # cat /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf
```

Example 3-21   /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf files from our cluster

```
!REQD 10.1.1.39 10.1.1.55 !REQD 10.10.1.39 10.10.1.73 !REQD 172.16.21.39 172.16.20.1 root@inst2 / # cat /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf !REQD 10.1.1.47 10.1.1.55 !REQD 10.10.1.47 10.10.1.73 !REQD 172.16.21.47 172.16.20.1
```

## 3.8.3  Initial cluster setup

Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Initial Cluster Setup (Typical)  Setup a Cluster, Nodes and Networks . Provide a cluster name (avoid extra or international characters), add new nodes by moving the cursor down to the New nodes line, and press F4. SMIT shows you the host names from your /etc/hosts file. Select the hostname of the new node with F7. See Figure 3-20 on page 115.

PowerHA performs the following actions:

- Connects to the nodes through the specific communication path.
- Discovers the current network settings.
- Parses the /etc/hosts file.
- Discovers the shared disk settings.
- Defines the boot addresses in the cluster topology.
- Creates the network definitions for the cluster topology. By default, the new network name is net\_ether\_01 , and it contains all base adapters.

This information is used in the SMIT menus to help users accurately select the existing components.

Important: Ensure that the following information applies when you add a new node to the cluster:

- The hostname can be resolved.
- There is no alias for the hostname in the /etc/hosts file.
- The hostname is not an alias.
- The hostname and the PowerHA node name are the same.
- The hostname and the 'communication path to the node' are the same.

Figure 3-20   Set up the cluster

<!-- image -->

We created our installation\_cluster with two nodes: inst1 and inst2. We selected the persistent adapter (inst2) of the second node as the communication path to the new node. When the setup is finished, the SMIT output shows the network and disk information of the discovered nodes.

## 3.8.4  Defining the repository disk

Define the repository disk and the cluster IP address:

1. Ensure that the repository disk has the same PVID on all cluster nodes. See 'Configuring the hdisk Physical Volume ID on all cluster nodes' on page 107.
2. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Initial Cluster Setup (Typical)  Define Repository Disk and Cluster IP Address . Figure 3-21 on page 116 shows the SMIT window for defining the repository disk.
3. Press F4 and select the repository disk from the pickup list.

4. You can specify the cluster IP address that is the multicast address that is used for the heartbeat. If you leave it blank, PowerHA creates one for you (See 'Multicast heartbeat' on page 89).

Figure 3-21   Defining the repository disk and cluster IP address

<!-- image -->

## 3.8.5  Adding persistent IP labels

We describe how to add persistent IP labels:

1. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage Nodes  Configure Persistent Node IP Label/Addresses  Add a Persistent Node IP Label/Address  Select a Node . See Figure 3-22 on page 117 for the corresponding SMIT window.
2. Press F4 to list the available networks. At least one network is defined in the PowerHA topology: net\_ether\_01 . This network is created during the initial cluster setup. By default, this network contains the IP range of the base addresses.
3. Select the network that contains the base adapters where the persistent address is located.
4. Go to the Node IP Label/Address line and press F4. The list shows the discovered and available IP labels from the /etc/hosts file. Choose the persistent address.
5. You can specify the netmask, or PowerHA automatically selects the netmask that is used on the base adapters.
6. Repeat this process for all persistent IP labels.

Figure 3-22   Add a persistent address

<!-- image -->

## 3.8.6  Checking the cluster topology information

Before you proceed, double-check your cluster topology. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the Cluster  Display PowerHA SystemMirror Configuration to verify the current PowerHA configuration. See Figure 3-23 on page 118.

Figure 3-23   Checking the PowerHA topology configuration

<!-- image -->

There are other useful PowerHA commands to verify the cluster configuration. For example, /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/cllsif is the best way to check the cluster network settings. See Example 3-22 for the output of the cllsif command on our sample cluster.

The persistent addresses are not shown in the cllsif output.

## 3.8.7 Verifying and synchronizing the cluster topology

We verify and deploy the cluster topology configuration. The PowerHA verification and synchronization performs the following tasks:

- Checks the new configuration for errors.
- Contacts the cluster nodes and downloads the current PowerHA configuration, if any.
- Compares the new and the current configuration.
- Synchronizes the new cluster configuration to all nodes.
- Creates and starts the CAA cluster.
- If the cluster is already running, the PowerHA applies the new modification dynamically.

Start smit sysmirror and select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration to synchronize the cluster. See Figure 3-24 for the output of the cluster verification function.

```

```

Figure 3-24   PowerHA verification and synchronization

Important: If you encounter any error or warning messages now, rerun the cluster verification and synchronization before you continue the installation process. For more information about how to debug your cluster problems, see 3.8.9, 'If a problem occurs during the initial cluster configuration' on page 121.

## 3.8.8  Checking the CAA cluster

The underlying CAA cluster must be up and running. We can check it with the lscluster command. See Example 3-23 on how to check the CAA cluster status.

```
root@inst1 / # lscluster -c Cluster query for cluster inst1_cluster returns: Cluster uuid: 0a21480a-7502-11e1-ad51-2e47986e9270 Number of nodes in cluster = 2 Cluster id for node inst1 is 1 Primary IP address for node inst1 is 172.16.21.39 Cluster id for node inst2 is 2 Primary IP address for node inst2 is 172.16.21.47 Number of disks in cluster = 0 Multicast address for cluster is 228.1.1.32 root@inst1 / # lscluster -m Calling node query for all nodes Node query number of nodes examined: 2 Node name: inst1 Cluster shorthand id for node: 1 uuid for node: 09d7df1c-7502-11e1-ad51-2e47986e9270 State of node:  UP  NODE_LOCAL Smoothed rtt to node: 0 Mean Deviation in network rtt to node: 0 Number of zones this node is a member in: 0 Number of clusters node is a member in: 1 CLUSTER NAME       TYPE  SHID   UUID inst1_cluster      local        0a21480a-7502-11e1-ad51-2e47986e9270 Number of points_of_contact for node: 0 Point-of-contact interface & contact state n/a ------------------------------Node name: inst2 Cluster shorthand id for node: 2 uuid for node: 0a1b8e06-7502-11e1-ad51-2e47986e9270 State of node:  UP Smoothed rtt to node: 7 Mean Deviation in network rtt to node: 3 Number of zones this node is a member in: 0 Number of clusters node is a member in: 1 CLUSTER NAME       TYPE  SHID   UUID inst1_cluster      local        0a21480a-7502-11e1-ad51-2e47986e9270
```

Example 3-23   Checking the CAA cluster status

```
Number of points_of_contact for node: 4 Point-of-contact interface & contact state dpcom  UP  RESTRICTED en1  UP en0  UP en2  UP
```

Also, check the status of the communication interfaces with the lscluster -i command.

## 3.8.9 If a problem occurs during the initial cluster configuration

If a problem occurs during the cluster topology definition and synchronization, check the following information:

- The network interfaces are set correctly, and they follow the networking rules that are described in 'Networking' on page 83.
- A common reason for failures is that multicasting does not work on the client network.
- The /etc/hosts file is correct.
- You follow the rules for the hostname (see 'Initial cluster setup' on page 114).
- The name resolution works.
- All communication interface pairs can ping each other.
- The inetd is enabled.
- Th e clcomd and clstrmgrES daemons are active on all nodes.
- For node connectivity, clrsh works between the nodes, see Example 3-24.

```
root@inst1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities # clrsh inst2 date Fri Mar 23 13:52:52 EDT 2012
```

Example 3-24   Checking node connectivity with the clrsh command

During the early stages of the cluster configuration, you can check the following log files:

- /var/log/clcomd/clcomd.log : Cluster communication daemon log file, which is useful to check node connectivity and Global Object Data Manager (ODM) problems
- /var/hacmp/log/cspoc.log : C-SPOC commands log file, which is useful to debug why a PowerHA command failed on a (remote) node
- /var/hacmp/adm/cluster.log : PowerHA cluster log file, mostly Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology (RSCT) messages
- /var/adm/ras/syslog.caa : CAA cluster log file, which is useful to check why the mkcluster command fails

On 3.13, 'Troubleshooting' on page 144, there are more cluster debugging tips and how to contact IBM for support.

## 3.9  Configuring PowerHA resources

We configure the PowerHA SystemMirror resources for high availability. We assume that you successfully configured and synchronized your PowerHA cluster topology.

## 3.9.1 Configuring the service IP labels

We follow these steps to configure the service IP labels:

1. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure Service IP Labels/Addresses  Add a Service IP Label/Address  Select the network name . See Figure 3-25 for the SMIT window.
2. Select the network that has the IP range of the corresponding base addresses.
3. Press F4 for the list of discovered and available IP labels.
4. Choose your service IP label. See Figure 3-26 on page 123.
5. Optional: Specify the netmask. By default, PowerHA uses the subnet mask of the underlying base adapters.

Figure 3-25   Select the network for the service IP label

<!-- image -->

Figure 3-26   Add a service IP label

<!-- image -->

6. Repeat this process for all service IP labels.

## 3.9.2  Configuring the service IP address distribution preference

This distribution preference defines which base adapter is used for the service, the persistent IP address, and where the external traffic leaves the server. For the available options, see 'PowerHA service IP addresses distribution policies' on page 10. We advise you to use Collocation with Persistent Label . Normally, you access the default gateway through your persistent address (as in our sample cluster). In this case, the persistent and the service addresses connect to same base adapter; therefore, you can avoid routing problems.

The optional Source IP Label for outgoing packets explicitly defines the source IP address that is used in the TCP/IP pockets for the outgoing traffic. If you have strict firewall rules, use this option. See also 3.5.14, 'Firewalls' on page 90.

Follow these steps to configure the service IP address distribution preference:

1. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure Service IP Labels/Addresses  Configure Service IP Label/Address Distribution Preferences . Then, select the network.
2. Press F4 and select the distribution preference. See Figure 3-27 on page 124.
3. Optional: Define the source IP label for the outgoing traffic. Press F4 for the available service IP labels.
4. Repeat these steps for all networks with service IP labels.

Figure 3-27   Configure service IP label distribution preference

<!-- image -->

## 3.9.3  Verifying the service IP settings

Verify the service IP address settings in PowerHA SystemMirror topology network settings with the cllsif command (Example 3-25). Because a service address can be on both nodes, the cllsif lists them twice.

Example 3-25   Checking the service adapter settings in the PowerHA topology

## 3.9.4  Creating the resource group

We describe how to create a resource group:

1. Start smit sysmirror . Then, select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Add a Resource Group . See Figure 3-28.
2. Supply the resource group name. We advise that you provide a meaningful name for the resource group. For example, include the primary node name or the application name in the resource group name. We use inst1rg and inst2rg for the names in our sample cluster.
3. Select the participating node names. The node name order is important because it is the node priority order for the resource group. You can select the nodes from the pickup list by pressing F4.

Figure 3-28   Add a resource group in smit sysmirror

<!-- image -->

4. Select the startup policies:
2. -Online On Home Node Only
3. -Online On First Available Node
4. -Online Using Distribution Policy
5. -Online On All Available Nodes
5. Choose the fallover policies:
7. -Fallover To Next Priority Node In The List
8. -Fallover Using Dynamic Node Priority
9. -Bring Offline (On Error Node Only)
6. Select the fallback policies:
11. -Fallback To Higher Priority Node In The List
12. -Never Fallback

For a detailed description of these resource group policies, see 'PowerHA resource group policies' on page 12.

We created two resource groups with the following characteristics:

- Resource group name: inst1rg :
- -Participating nodes (default node priority): inst1, inst2
- -Startup policy: Online On First Available Node
- -Fallover policy: Fallover To Next Priority Node In The List
- -Fallback policy: Fallback To Higher Priority Node In The List
- Resource group name: inst2rg :
- -Participating nodes (default node priority): inst2, inst1
- -Startup policy: Online On Home Node Only
- -Fallover policy: Fallover To Next Priority Node In The List
- -Fallback policy: Never Fallback

## 3.9.5 Adding resources and attributes for the resource groups

In this step, we define the cluster resources, such as the service address, shared volume group, and attributes for the resource groups.

Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Change/Show Resources and Attributes for a Resource Group  Select the resource group . See Figure 3-29 on page 127 for the SMIT panel.

Change/Show All Resources and Attributes for a Resource Group

Figure 3-29   Add resources for a resource group

## You can specify the following parameters:

- Fallback Timer Policy : See 'PowerHA resource group policies' on page 12 for more information.
- Service IP Labels/Addresses : Y ou can add one or more service addresses. Press F4 for the list of the available service labels.
- Application Controllers : Press F4 for the defined application servers. We do not use this option during this setup.

- Volume Groups : F4 gives the list of the discovered, shared, and enhanced concurrent volume groups.
- Use forced varyon of volume groups, if necessary : Select true only if you use AIX LVM mirroring in the shared volume groups.
- Automatically Import Volume Groups : Leave it false . This setting is only important when you add a volume group to the cluster dynamically.
- File systems : If you want PowerHA to mount all file systems from the shared volume groups, leave this field empty.
- File systems Consistency Check : Y ou can select between the fsck and logredo commands to perform the consistency check. We advise that you use fsck .
- File systems Recovery Method : It can be sequential or parallel . If you have many shared file systems, set it to parallel .
- File systems mounted before IP configured : When you use NFS in the cluster, always set it to true . Otherwise, leave it false .
- File systems/Directories to Export (NFSv2/3) : Enter the directories to NFS export inside the cluster.
- File systems/Directories to NFS Mount : All nodes in the resource group mount this file system. The format is global\_nfs\_mount;local\_filesystem . For the correct syntax, see 'NFS cross mount' on page 129.
- Network For NFS Mount : The preferred network to mount over the NFS directories.
- Tape Resources : Y ou can add your tape resources here.
- Raw Disk PVIDs : If your application uses raw disks without volume groups, you must specify the physical volume IDs for the disks.
- Primary Workload Manager Class : Optional Workload Manager Class that is used by the primary node for this resource group.
- Secondary Workload Manager Class : Optional Workload Manager Class that is used by the backup nodes for this resource group.
- Miscellaneous Data : Y ou can specify a string here that is placed in the environment with the resource group information during script execution. Leave it empty.
- WPAR Name : Y ou can specify a WPAR name where this resource group application runs. For more information about WPARs and PowerHA, see Chapter 8, 'Workload partition and PowerHA scenario' on page 487.
- User Defined Resources : You can have your own type of resources. Virtually, it is a set of start, stop, recovery, and notification scripts for special purposes.

We create the following resources:

- Resources for inst1rg :
- -Service IP label: instsvc1
- -Volume groups: app1vg
- Resources for inst2rg :
- -Service IP label: instsvc2
- -Volume groups: app2vg

All other options are empty or use defaults.

## 3.9.6 NFS cross mount

If you want to use NFS cross mount in the cluster, you need extra preparation steps.

Important: The NFS cross mount requires that you install the following filesets:

- cluster.es.nfs
- bos.net.nfs.server
- bos.net.nfs.client

For example, you want to import a file system that is called /nfsdata to all cluster nodes from the primary node (inst1). You must create the file system in a shared volume group. But, do not name it /nfsdata . Use a different name for it: /nfsdata\_local . PowerHA mounts this file system locally on the primary node, then it exports and mounts it on all nodes under the /nfsdata name. On the local node, /nfsdata\_local is mounted to /nfsdata through NFS loopback (Example 3-26). Your application must use /nfsdata on all nodes.

Example 3-26   NFS cross mount on the primary node

Create a resource group with the following resources for the NFS cross mount. The following resources are for inst1rg:

- Participating nodes: inst1 and inst2

Service IP label:

instsvc1

- Volume group: app1vg
- File systems are mounted before the IP is configured: true
- File systems/directories to export (NFSv2/3): /nfsdata\_local
- File systems/directories to NFS mount: /nfsdata;/nfsdata\_local
- Network for NFS mount: net\_ether\_01

## 3.9.7  Checking the cluster resources

Review all modifications that you made before you performed the cluster synchronization. You can check the cluster resources by starting smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Show All Resources by Node or Resource Group  Show Resource Information by Resource Group  Select resource group . See Figure 3-30.

Figure 3-30   Displaying resource group configuration

<!-- image -->

## 3.9.8  Verifying and synchronizing the cluster resource configuration

Verify and synchronize the PowerHA cluster resources by starting smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration .

The PowerHA verification and synchronization performs the following tasks:

- Check the new configuration for errors.
- Contacts the cluster nodes and downloads the current PowerHA configuration.
- Compares the new and the current configuration.
- Synchronizes the new cluster configuration to all nodes.
- If the cluster is already running, it applies the new modification dynamically.

Important:

If you encounter any error or warning messages here, correct them and rerun cluster verification and synchronization before you proceed with the installation process.

For more information about how to debug your cluster problems, go to 3.13,

'Troubleshooting' on page 144.

## 3.9.9  Starting the cluster

It is time to start the cluster. Start smit sysmirror . Select System Management (C-SPOC)  PowerHA SystemMirror Services  Start Cluster Services , or use smit clstart to start the cluster services. By pressing F4, select both nodes to start. See Figure 3-31 for the window.

Figure 3-31   smit clstart window

<!-- image -->

The following startup options are available:

- Start now, on system restart or both : Normally, you select now . However, you can specify that the cluster automatically starts at system reboot, which is not advised.
- Start Cluster Services on these nodes : Select the cluster nodes where you want to start the cluster. Select all nodes.
- Manage Resource Groups : If you specify Automatically , PowerHA starts all resource groups. Manually means that you have to bring up the resource group by using smit cspoc . Then, select Resource Groups and Applications  Bring a Resource Group Online .
- BROADCAST message at startup : The cluster manager sends a 'wall' broadcast notification to all terminal sessions.

- Startup Cluster Information Daemon : If you plan to use the clstat utility or any other Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based monitoring tool, you must start the clinfo daemon. For more information about clstat , see 'Clstat' on page 154.
- Ignore verification errors : During the cluster startup, PowerHA runs a full cluster verification and synchronization. If this process encounters any error, you can force the cluster manager to ignore it. This option is useful if you lost one of your nodes or the cluster configuration is broken.
- Automatically correct errors found during cluster start : You can select how the cluster manager corrects the verification errors: automatically , interactively (prompts for yes or no), or not at all.

Tip: Weadvise that you monitor the output of the /var/hacmp/log/hacmp.out log file during the cluster startup, shutdown, and resource group movement operation.

## 3.9.10  Verifying PowerHA services

After you successfully start PowerHA on all nodes, check the status of the cluster:

- Cluster resource group status ( /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clRGinfo -m ).
- Service addresses are configured ( netstat -in ).
- Shared volume groups are activated in concurrent mode ( lspv ).
- Shared file systems are mounted ( mount ).
- Repository disk is activated and /aha file system is mounted ( lspv , mount ).
- Log on to the nodes from an external server by using the service address of the nodes.

See Example 3-28 to check the status of the cluster by using various AIX commands.

## 3.9.11  Testing the cluster functionality without an application

Before we install the application, we must test the PowerHA functionality. Without a configured application, we can ensure that the cluster works and that the takeover and resource group movements work. To start a resource group relocation, start smit sysmirror . Select System Management (C-SPOC)  Resource Groups and Applications  Move Resource Groups to Another Node . Select the resource group to move from the list, and then, select the destination node (see Figure 3-32).

For more details about testing PowerHA SystemMirror, see 3.12, 'Test scenarios' on page 143. If you encountered any problem during the cluster tests, check the /var/hacmp/log/hacmp.out log file for any obvious errors or config\_too\_long\_events . For more information about how to debug PowerHA problems, see 3.13, 'Troubleshooting' on page 144.

## 3.9.12 Stopping the cluster

Follow these steps if you want to stop the PowerHA SystemMirror:

1. Start smit clstop . See Figure 3-33.
2. Select the nodes where you want to stop the cluster.
3. Choose the shutdown mode:
4. -Bring Resource Groups Offline : Normal shutdown of the cluster. The application stops.
5. -Move Resource Groups : Takeover. The resource groups from the node are moved to the other nodes.
6. -Unmanage Resource Groups : The PowerHA stops, but all resources, the application, shared volume groups, and service IP remain available on the cluster node. This method is a good way to install the PowerHA fixes without stopping the application.

Figure 3-33   Stop PowerHA SystemMirror

## 3.10  Configuring the application for PowerHA

Now, our cluster is ready for the application installation. Follow these steps:

1. Start the cluster and bring up all resource groups on its primary node.
2. Hand over the cluster to the application administrators.
3. Install the application on the primary node.
4. Create the application startup and shutdown scripts. For more information, see 'Creating the application startup and shutdown scripts' on page 135.
5. Stop the application on the primary node.
6. Move the resource groups to the backup server.
7. Install the application on the backup server.
8. Stop the application and revert the cluster.

Ensure that the following information is correct:

- You have the same users and settings cluster wide. User names and the corresponding user ID (UID) must be the same on all nodes. See 'Showing the disk UUID' on page 182.
- You install all application components on all nodes.
- The application configuration is the same everywhere.
- The application survives an abrupt end and restart. You might need to enable application redo logging.
- You have to maintain the application on all cluster nodes during the full lifecycle of the system. If you install application upgrades or new components, you must apply the changes on all cluster nodes.

## 3.10.1  Creating the application startup and shutdown scripts

You must write your own application startup and shutdown scripts. Follow these guidelines:

- Put your scripts in a separate directory for easy management.
- Name them meaningfully.
- Do not use interactive scripts or startup and shutdown programs.
- The startup script must start all of the required application components.
- The shutdown script must stop all application components. No process can be running.
- The scripts can differ on the nodes, but they must have the same name and path.
- The scripts must finish in a timely manner and return exit 0 on success. For example, with an Oracle Database, use shutdown abort to stop the database.
- During execution, PowerHA redirects the output of the script to the /var/hacmp/log/hacmp.out log. We advise you to log all pertinent information to a separate application startup and shutdown log file.
- Test run your scripts before you add them to the cluster configuration.

## 3.10.2  Creating the application monitoring scripts

PowerHA SystemMirror supports application monitoring. There are two methods:

- Process monitoring: You have to specify a process name, the number of instances, and the process owner name. PowerHA checks for this specific process.
- Custom monitoring: You can write your own application monitor script.

Requirements for the custom application monitor script:

- Check the application availability by running some internal application process. For example, in Oracle, you can run an SQL select on the system tables.
- The script must finish in a few seconds.
- The monitor must return exit code 0 on success.
- The monitor must return a non-zero exit code on failure.
- If the application fails, print a meaningful description of the error.
- The scripts can differ on the nodes, but they must have the same name and path.
- PowerHA redirects the output of the monitoring script to the /var/hacmp/log directory. The file name is clappmond.&lt; application\_name &gt;.&lt; resource\_group\_name &gt;.monitor.log .

## 3.10.3 Configuring the application control scripts in PowerHA

We describe how to configure the application control scripts in PowerHA:

1. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure User Applications (Scripts and Monitors)  Application Controller Scripts  Add Application Controller Scripts . See Figure 3-34.
2. Enter the name of the application server (use a meaningful name).
3. Provide the full path name of the startup and stop scripts.
4. You cannot add the application monitor name yet, so leave it empty. We configure that name in the next step ('Configuring the application monitor in PowerHA' on page 136).
5. Select the application startup mode. The default and suggested mode is background . If you specify foreground , the PowerHA event execution waits for the termination of the application startup script.

We created two application servers:

- Application controller name: app1
- -Start script: /usr/ha/start\_app1
- -Stop script: /usr/ha/stop\_app1
- Application controller name:

app2

- -Start script: /usr/ha/start\_app2
- -Stop script: /usr/ha/stop\_app2

## 3.10.4  Configuring the application monitor in PowerHA

Important: Ensure that the application administrators are aware of the application monitoring. They must know how to suspend and resume the monitoring.

During application changes and upgrades, you must suspend the monitoring. For instructions to suspend and resume the application monitoring, see 4.7, 'Monitoring the cluster' on page 154.

Configure the application monitor in PowerHA SystemMirror:

1. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure User Applications (Scripts and Monitors)  Application Monitors  Configure Custom Application Monitors  Add a Custom Application Monitor . See Figure 3-35 on page 138.
2. Enter a name for the monitor.
3. Select the corresponding application.
4. Choose between Long-running monitoring , Startup Monitoring , or Both :
5. -Long-running Monitoring : The default mode. PowerHA periodically checks the availability of the application. The checks start after the specified stabilization interval passed.
6. -Startup Monitoring : In this case, the cluster manager checks that the application successfully started during the stabilization interval. This option is useful if you have a child resource group and an application that depends on this application.
7. -Both : The combination of the prior two methods.
5. Enter the full path name of the monitor script.
6. Supply the following parameters (all interval values are in seconds):
10. -Monitor Interval : The monitor runs periodically at this interval. Usually, 60 seconds is fine.
11. -Hung Monitor Signal : The signal is sent to stop the Monitor Method if it does not return within the monitor interval. By default, it is SIGKILL (9).
12. -Stabilization Interval : The estimated start time of the application. There is no monitoring during this period for Long-running monitoring . In Startup Monitoring mode, the application must be up and running within this period. If not, PowerHA starts a takeover. To be cautious, specify a generous time, for example 180 seconds.
13. -Restart Count : The number of times to restart the application before you start a takeover.
14. -Restart Interval : The number of seconds that the application must remain stable after the stabilization interval resets the restart counter. The formula is:
15. restart interval &gt;= 1.1 * restart count* (monitor Interval + stabilization Interval)
16. Eventually, PowerHA calculates this interval for you if you leave it blank.
17. -Action on Application Failure : Select Takeover or Notify . If you choose notify, you have to supply a script that runs if an application has an error.
18. -Notify Method : The full path name of the notification script. This method is required only if you choose Notify earlier.
19. -Cleanup Method : Y ou can leave it blank; PowerHA uses the application server stop script. Alternatively, you can specify another application stop script.
20. -Restart Method : If blank, PowerHA uses the application startup script, but you can have a different startup script.

## 3.10.6  Cluster verification and synchronization

To apply the application configuration changes, we must run cluster verification and synchronization again. This process checks for configuration errors and deploys the new cluster configuration. If everything is correct, PowerHA starts the application.

Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration .

## 3.10.7 Checking the application integration

As the final step in the cluster application integration, you have to ensure that the application starts and stops correctly in the PowerHA cluster. We advise you to perform a full cluster test, as described in 3.12, 'Test scenarios' on page 143.

You can check the resource group and application status with the clRGinfo command (Example 3-29).

## 3.11  Dynamic LPAR and capacity on demand resources

PowerHA supports Dynamic LPAR, capacity on demand (CoD) CPU, and memory resources. You can configure the minimum and desired number of CPUs, virtual CPUs, and memory for each application. When an application is activated on a node, PowerHA contacts the HMC to acquire this resource in addition to the current resources of the LPAR.

In our final example, we show how to set up Dynamic LPAR and CoD resources. If you plan to use CoD resources, ensure that they are activated on the HMC.

1. Example 3-30 shows how to set up passwordless Secure Shell (SSH) communication to the HMC.
2. Add the HMC communication path to a node.

```
root@inst1 /.ssh # /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t rsa Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (//.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in //.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in //.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 9c:00:9f:61:d9:40:60:0c:1d:6b:89:ac:f9:8e:fc:f5 root@inst1 root@inst1 / # mykey=`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` root@inst1 / # ssh hscroot@172.16.20.113 mkauthkeys -a \"$mykey\"
```

Example 3-30   Set up passwordless SSH communication to the HMC

Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure User Applications (Scripts and Monitors)  Configure Application for Dynamic LPAR and CoD Resources  Configure Communication Path to HMC  Add HMC IP addresses for a node . See Figure 3-37 on page 141.

You have to enter the node name, the corresponding HMC IP address, and the managed system name (server name).

3. Configure the Dynamic LPAR or CoD resources:
- a. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure User Applications (Scripts and Monitors)  Configure Application for Dynamic LPAR and CoD Resources  Configure Dynamic LPAR and CoD Resources for Applications  Add Dynamic LPAR and CoD Resources for Applications . See Figure 3-38 on page 142.
- b. Select the application.
- c. Supply the following parameters:
- Minimum number of CPUs : Minimum number of virtual CPUs to acquire when the resource group is activated. If the system cannot fulfill this request, PowerHA starts the resource group recovery actions and takes over.
- Desired number of CPUs
- Minimum number of processing units : Minimum number of processing units to acquire for the resource group. If the system does not have enough CPU capacity, PowerHA performs a takeover.
- Desired number of processing units
- Minimum amount of memory : The minimum memory that is required for the application. If the server does not have enough memory, PowerHA performs a takeover.
- Desired amount of memory
- Use CUoD if resources are insufficient : Select yes, if you want to use CoD resources.
- I agree to use CUoD resources : Select yes one more time if you plan to use CoD.

In Figure 3-38, we configured four virtual CPUs and two processing units for app1 . We can see the actual CPU capacity numbers on the backup node ( inst2 ) when app1rg is not activated (Example 3-31).

Example 3-31   Entitled capacity and the number of online CPUs when app1 is not activated

root@inst2 / # lparstat -i|grep  "Entitled Capacity" Entitled Capacity                          : 1.00

root@inst2 / # lparstat -i|grep  "Online Virtual CPU"

Online Virtual CPUs                        : 4

After the takeover application app1 is activated on node inst2 , and the required CPU and memory settings are acquired for the application, we can see the virtual CPU and entitled capacity settings on Example 3-32 on page 143.

Example 3-32   Entitled capacity and virtual CPU settings when app1 is activated

After you perform each test, ensure that the following capabilities work:

- You can connect to the application through its service IP .
- The shared volume groups and file systems are mounted.
- The resource groups are active on the correct node.
- Applications are running.

## 3.13 Troubleshooting

We introduce the basic PowerHA problem determination techniques.

## 3.13.1 Cluster start-up problems

If your cluster cannot start, check the following areas:

- Network interfaces are set correctly; therefore, they follow the networking rules that are described in 'Networking' on page 83.
- Check that multicasting works correctly (most common problem with PowerHA 7.1 at client sites).
- The /etc/hosts file is correct.
- You follow the rules for the hostname (see 'Initial cluster setup' on page 114).
- Name resolution works.
- All communication interface pairs can ping each other.
- inetd is enabled.
- The clcomd and clstrmgrES daemons are active on all nodes.
- Node connectivity: clrsh works between the nodes.
- Check the AIX error log ( errpt ).
- Check the cluster configuration on all nodes.
- Run cluster verification and synchronization.

## 3.13.2  Resource group errors

If you encounter resource group errors, check the cluster status first:

- Cluster resource group status ( /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clRGinfo -m ).
- Application status ( ps -ef ).
- Persistent and service addresses are configured ( netstat -in ).

- Shared volume groups are activated in concurrent mode ( lspv ).
- Shared file systems are mounted ( mount ).
- Repository disk is activated and /aha file system is mounted ( lspv , mount ).
- You can log on to the nodes from an external server by using the service address of the nodes.
- Check the /var/hacmp/log/hacmp.out log for errors. For more information, see 'The hacmp.out file' on page 146.
- Check the AIX error log ( errpt -a ).

## 3.13.3  Recovering from a script error

If you can locate the problem and resolve it, you can enable PowerHA to continue to process the resource group. For example, a typical problem is that the application cannot stop because the stop script does not handle all application components. If you stop the remaining application processes, you can recover the cluster from the script error:

1. Run smit sysmirror . Select Problem Determination Tools  Recover From PowerHA SystemMirror Script Failure .
2. Select the node where the error occurred.
3. Alternatively, you can run /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clruncmd &lt; nodename &gt; command.
3. Check the /var/hacmp/log/hacmp.out log file for the result that you want.
4. You might have to run the script recovery on all cluster nodes.

## 3.13.4  Releasing locks that are set by dynamic reconfiguration

If you encounter an error during dynamic reconfiguration and the cluster is locked, you can release the DARE locks. Start smit sysmirror . Select Problem Determination Tools  Release Locks Set By Dynamic Reconfiguration .

## 3.13.5  Comparing active and default configurations

You can compare the active, running configuration of the cluster with the ODM-based configuration. With this option, you can identify the changes that are made since the last cluster verification. Start smit sysmirror . Select Problem Determination Tools  Compare Active and Default Configurations .

Example 3-33 shows the output of the cl\_dare\_compare command after we added a service label ( instsvc2 ) to the inst1rg resource group.

Example 3-33   Comparing the active and default cluster configurations

root@inst2 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/cl\_dare\_compare No unsynchronized changes exist - nothing to compare against. Cluster services are active Comparing configuration in /etc/es/objrepos against /usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc/objrepos/active Contents of HACMPadapter do not match Current:                               |  New:

```
HACMPresource:                         < group = "inst1rg"              < type = ""                      < name = "SERVICE_LABEL"         < value = "instsvc2"             < id = 20                        < Found 1 difference in the configuration
```

## 3.13.6  Restoring the PowerHA SystemMirror configuration database from the active configuration

If you unintentionally changed the PowerHA SystemMirror configuration and did not synchronize the cluster, you can restore the original settings from the active, running configuration.

Start smit sysmirror and select Problem Determination Tools  Restore PowerHA SystemMirror Configuration Database from Active Configuration .

## 3.13.7 The hacmp.out file

The /var/hacmp/log/hacmp.out log file is our best source of information about the cluster events. If you encounter any cluster startup, shutdown, or takeover (resource group movement) problem, you have to look in this file for details. Use the grep "EVENT START" /var/hacmp/log/hacmp.out command to see what happened on the cluster. Example 3-34 shows the PowerHA events during a node startup.

```
root@inst1 /var/hacmp/log # grep "EVENT START" hacmp.out
```

Example 3-34   Looking for events in the /var/hacmp/log.hacmp.out file

```
Mar 26 13:56:23 EVENT START: node_up inst1 Mar 26 13:56:26 EVENT START: rg_move_fence inst1 1 Mar 26 13:56:26 EVENT START: rg_move_acquire inst1 1 Mar 26 13:56:26 EVENT START: rg_move inst1 1 ACQUIRE Mar 26 13:56:27 EVENT START: acquire_service_addr Mar 26 13:56:28 EVENT START: acquire_aconn_service en2 net_ether_01 Mar 26 13:56:31 EVENT START: rg_move_complete inst1 1 Mar 26 13:56:31 EVENT START: start_server app1 Mar 26 13:56:35 EVENT START: node_up_complete inst1 Mar 26 13:56:46 EVENT START: node_up inst2 Mar 26 13:56:50 EVENT START: rg_move_fence inst1 2 Mar 26 13:56:50 EVENT START: rg_move_acquire inst1 2 Mar 26 13:56:50 EVENT START: rg_move inst1 2 ACQUIRE Mar 26 13:56:59 EVENT START: rg_move_complete inst1 2 Mar 26 13:57:03 EVENT START: node_up_complete inst2
```

Because the hacmp.out file can be large, the best way to work with it is to search for the ' !!!!!!!!!! ERROR !!!!!!!!!! ' string. The real error messages are usually a few lines above this string. Example 3-35 shows a part of the hacmp.out file with varyonvg errors.

Example 3-35   hacmp.out errors

```
+inst1rg:cl_pvo:app1vg[17] rc=20 +inst1rg:cl_pvo:app1vg[18] : exit status of varyonvg -n -c -P app1vg is: 20
```

```

## 3.13.8  Application monitoring log files

The application monitor files are in the /var/hacmp/log directory. The file name is clappmond.application\_name.resource\_group\_name.monitor.log .

## 3.13.9  Other log files

We show the locations of more log files:

- /var/log/clcomd/clcomd.log : Cluster communication daemon log file, which is useful to check node connectivity and global ODM problems
- /var/hacmp/log/cspoc.log : C-SPOC commands log file helps you debug why a PowerHA command failed on a node
- /var/hacmp/adm/cluster.log : PowerHA cluster log file, which is mostly RSCT messages
- /var/adm/ras/syslog.caa : CAA cluster log file, which is useful to check why the mkcluster command failed
- /var/hacmp/log/clstrmgr.debug : Cluster manager debug file
- /var/hacmp/log/clavan.log : Cluster events

- /var/hacmp/log/cl\_event\_summaries.txt : Cluster events summary
- /var/hacmp/log/autoverify.log : Daily automatic cluster verification log file

## 3.13.10 Contacting IBM support

If you encounter a serious issue with your cluster, and you want to contact IBM support, collect the following information:

- IBM customer number
- Server type and serial number
- PowerHA snap
- Description of the events as clearly as possibly
- Indication of the time of the events, which is important because sometimes we cannot decide which cluster test or event caused the problem

## 3.13.11  Collecting PowerHA snap

We show how to collect the PowerHA snap:

1. Remove the earlier snap information from the nodes: Run snap -r on all cluster nodes to clean up the /tmp/ibmsupt directory structure.
2. Collect AIX snap: Execute snap -a on all nodes. The snap files are collected under the /tmp/ibmsupt directory.
3. Run PowerHA snap: Issue the snap -e command only on one node to collect the PowerHA configuration from all nodes. The output files are in the /tmp/ibmsupt/hacmp directory.
4. Gather the snap files from the /tmp/ibmsupt directory structure into a tar archive. The file name must contain the node name, for example, inst1.snap.tar.Z .
5. Rename the files so that they start with the IBM PMR number. The PMR number is provided by the IBM Technical Support personnel.

Important: The PowerHA snap -e must be collected as soon as possible after the problem to avoid log file wraps and to prevent the loss of useful information to debug the problem.

## Cluster administration

In this chapter, we discuss the administration tasks that relate to the PowerHA SystemMirror daily operations:

- AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror service pack upgrade
- Reconfiguring the cluster online
- Cross-site mirroring and AIX LVM Mirror pools
- Critical volume groups (voting disks) for Oracle RAC
- Federated security for cluster-wide security management

## 4.1  Introduction

Most of the daily administration tasks can be performed from the smit cspoc menu as seen in Figure 4-1. Expert administrators can use the Cluster Single Point of Control (C-SPOC) command line. For easy understanding, we use smit cspoc in all of our examples.

## 4.2  AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror service pack upgrade

Important: Install the latest AIX and PowerHA fixes regularly (twice a year).

You can download the AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror service packs from the IBM FixCentral website:

http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/

Install the latest AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror fixes regularly. Because the AIX service packs contain a new kernel, you cannot avoid a system restart and a short downtime. Also, this scheduled downtime is an opportunity to run takeover tests and ensure that the PowerHA configuration is correct.

You can install PowerHA SystemMirror fixes without any downtime by following these steps:

1. Stop the cluster services on a node that hosts the application.
2. After all upgraded PowerHA SystemMirror cluster nodes are running and the cluster is stable, bring node A offline without bringing its associated resource groups offline by stopping cluster services by using the Unmanage Resource Groups option. (Before PowerHA SystemMirror 5.4, we called this approach ' forced down '.)
2. Install the PowerHA SystemMirror Service Pack.

On node A, apply the PowerHA SystemMirror Service Pack update, which updates the PowerHA SystemMirror configuration database (Object Data Managers (ODMs)).

3. Start cluster services on the upgraded node.
2. Start cluster services on node A. Node A is running the updated PowerHA SystemMirror version while nodes B, C, and others are running the previous version of PowerHA SystemMirror. The upgraded version of PowerHA SystemMirror starts monitoring the running applications and resources on node A. When you run the clstart command, PowerHA SystemMirror executes the application controller start script, unless there is a configured application monitor.
4. Verify the upgraded cluster definition.

After all nodes are running and the cluster is stable, run cluster verification on the upgraded PowerHA SystemMirror cluster.

## 4.3  Reconfiguring the cluster online

You can perform any cluster resource reconfiguration tasks online, while the cluster is up and running and the application is online. In our installation 3.7, 'PowerHA SystemMirror installation and prerequisites' on page 91, we reconfigured the resources groups while the cluster was up and running.

We encourage you to do all PowerHA SystemMirror reconfiguration while the cluster is running. For example, you can add, change, or remove the following objects:

- Nodes
- Networks
- Resources
- Application servers
- Application monitors
- Resource groups

There is only one limitation: you cannot change a resource while it serves an online resource group. For example, you cannot change the service address of the online resource group. The online reconfiguration is safe. PowerHA warns you or prevents the modification that risks the online resource groups and application.

After the configuration changes, you have to run PowerHA cluster synchronization and verification. PowerHA cluster synchronization and verification starts the Dynamic Reconfiguration (DARE) process, which activates the changes.

## 4.4  Verifying the cluster automatically

Important: Enable the daily automatic cluster verification. Remember to check the output file regularly.

The PowerHA SystemMirror can run automatic cluster verification every day. You can set it up by starting smit sysmirror . Select Problem Determination Tools  PowerHA SystemMirror Verification  Automatic Cluster Configuration Monitoring . See Figure 4-2 on page 152. You can modify the daily schedule and the node that runs the test and hosts the log files. The Default node is the first node in alphabetical order in the cluster configuration.

Figure 4-2   Automatic cluster configuration monitoring setup

<!-- image -->

In a verification error, PowerHA sends a broadcast message to all users. The automatic cluster verification log files are at these locations:

- /var/hacmp/log/autoclstrcfgmonitor.out
- /var/hacmp/clverify.log
- /var/hacmp/log/autoverify.log

## 4.5  Regularly testing your cluster

Regularly check your cluster and run takeover tests. For a list of test cases, see 3.12, 'Test scenarios' on page 143. From our experience, we know that most cluster configurations and applications evolve over time. Not all application and system administrators are aware of the related required cluster configuration tasks. For example, we show some of the typical user errors on long-running clusters that can be avoided by performing regular takeover tests:

- User and user ID mismatch between nodes
- Missing users on the backup node
- Forgotten passwords on the backup nodes
- Missing application components on the backup nodes
- Different versions of the application across the cluster nodes
- Application startup and shutdown scripts no longer work correctly
- Incorrectly mounted non-clustered file systems, Network File System (NFS), or Samba-shares and exports (the CD-ROM is mounted under the shared file system)
- New firewalls, or firewall rules between the cluster nodes
- Erroneous /etc/hosts file
- Ping address that is used in netmon.cf or in the EtherChannel configuration no longer works

Check the AIX error log ( errpt ) daily to avoid trouble, such as realizing that the disk failure errors started a year ago.

## 4.6  Backing up the cluster configuration

PowerHA SystemMirror snapshot facility provides a convenient method to back up and restore the cluster configuration. If you plan to modify your cluster, you can create a snapshot first. If you are not happy with the new configuration, you can easily restore the configuration from the snapshot.

The snapshot creates two files: info and odm :

- The info file contains readable output of the cluster configuration and useful information, including the network setup and the shared Logical Volume Manager (LVM) information. You can use this file to document the cluster.
- The odm file is a full copy of the PowerHA ODM files.

Important: Back up your cluster configuration data regularly.

The following steps create a PowerHA snapshot:

1. Start smit sysmirror and select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the Cluster  Snapshot Configuration  Create a Snapshot of the Cluster Configuration .
2. On the SMIT panel (Figure 4-3), enter a meaningful name for the snapshot. This name is the name of the snapshot files ( name.info and name.odm ).
3. You can specify a custom snapshot method, and a short description of the backup.
4. Do not include the cluster log files in the snapshot.
5. The snapshot files are created in the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/snapshots directory.

Figure 4-3 PowerHA snapshot

<!-- image -->

For data safety, we perform this backup regularly:

1. Back up the system by using the mksysb command.
2. Create an AIX snap with the snap -ac command and save the /tmp/ibmsupt/snap.pax.Z file in a safe place. The snap data contains all AIX configuration settings.
3. Back up the PowerHA cluster configuration by using the snapshot facility. Save the files in a safe place.

## 4.6.1 Restoring the cluster configuration from a snapshot

We describe how to restore the cluster configuration from a PowerHA snapshot:

1. Start smit sysmirror and select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the Cluster  Snapshot Configuration  Restore the Cluster Configuration From a Snapshot .
2. Select the snapshot to restore. The snapshot files are in the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/snapshots directory.
3. Select Yes to 'Un/Configure Cluster Resources'. See Figure 4-4 for the screen capture of the SMIT panel.

```

## 4.7 Monitoring the cluster

There are several commands that show the cluster and its resource group status. We show the most useful commands.

## 4.7.1  Clstat

Clstat is an interactive utility that shows the cluster status online. It requires the clinfo daemon and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Version 3.

Figure 4-5 on page 155 shows the output of the clstat command.

```

## 4.7.2  Cldump

Cldump commands provide similar detailed information about the cluster status. It is not an interactive program; therefore, you can use it in shell scripts. It requires clinfo and SNMP Version 1. See Example 4-1 for the cldump output in our sample cluster.

## 4.7.3  ClRGinfo

The /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clRGinfo command shows the resource group and the application status. The command does not require SNMP or clinfo . clRGinfo -s creates colon-separated output that is easy to process in a shell script. Example 4-2 shows the clRGinfo command.

## 4.8 Resource group and application management

In this chapter, we describe the resource group and application management tools in PowerHA SystemMirror. We present the following topics:

- Bringing a resource group online
- Bringing a resource group offline
- Moving a resource group
- Suspending or resuming application monitoring
- Application analysis

## 4.8.1  Bringing a resource group online

To start a resource group and its application, execute the following commands:

1. Start smitty cspoc and click Resource Groups and Applications  Bring a Resource Group Online . See Figure 4-6.
2. Select the resource group. Only the offline resource groups are shown in the pickup list.
3. Select the destination node. An asterisk shows the primary node for that resource group.
4. Wait for the cluster to stabilize.

```
Bring a Resource Group Online Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes.

## 4.8.3  Moving a resource group

To move a resource group and an application between the nodes, follow these steps:

1. Start smitty cspoc and click Resource Groups and Applications  Move Resource Groups to Another Node . See Figure 4-8.
2. Select the resource group. The pickup list shows the current location and status of the resource group.
3. Select the destination node. An asterisk shows the primary node for that resource group.
4. Wait for the cluster to stabilize.

```
Move Resource Group(s) to Another Node Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes. [Entry Fields] Resource Group(s) to be Moved                       inst1rg Destination Node                                    inst2 F1=Help             F2=Refresh          F3=Cancel           F4=List F5=Reset            F6=Command          F7=Edit             F8=Image F9=Shell            F10=Exit            Enter=Do
```

## 4.8.4  Suspending or resuming application monitoring

Important: Your application administrator must be aware of the PowerHA application monitoring feature.

Before you perform any changes to the application environment that require application downtime, suspend the application monitoring.

You have to suspend the application monitoring if you plan to perform any administration task that requires application downtime while the PowerHA resources are active, such as applying fixes for the application.

## Suspending application monitoring

The following steps show how to suspend the application monitoring:

1. Start smitty cspoc and select Resource Groups and Applications  Suspend/Resume Application Monitoring  Suspend Application Monitoring . See Figure 4-9.
2. Select the application controller.
3. Select the resource group for the application. One application controller can be in more than one resource group.

Figure 4-9   Suspend application monitoring

<!-- image -->

## Resuming application monitoring

The following steps show how to resume application monitoring:

1. Start smitty cspoc and select Resource Groups and Applications  Suspend/Resume Application Monitoring  Resume Application Monitoring .
2. Select the application controller.
3. Select the resource group for the application.

## 4.8.5  Application analysis

This tool provides regular reports about the application availability. Follow these steps to configure this tool:

1. Start smitty cspoc . Select Resource Groups and Applications  Application Availability Analysis .
2. Select the application.
3. Provide the start date for the analysis.
4. Enter the end date.

See the application availability analysis report for our sample cluster as shown in Figure 4-10 on page 160.

Figure 4-10   Application availability analysis

<!-- image -->

## 4.9  New application controller foreground startup

In versions before PowerHA 7.1.1, the start scripts of the application controllers run in the background and their exit code is ignored. It is still the default of PowerHA 7.1.1, but you can choose now for foreground execution instead. Foreground execution causes the cluster event processing to wait for the completion of the application controller start script. With foreground execution, your application controller start script is called synchronously during the node up event, and execution of the event stops until the controller start script completes. If the start script exits with a non-zero exit code, the node up event fails.

The exit code of the script is not checked in the PowerHA 7.1.1 base version. SP1 changed this situation and a non-zero exit causes now an event error. Also, SP1 added timestamps and tracing of the startup sequence in hacmp.out .

Foreground startup simplifies the design of start scripts and allows the sequencing of resource groups with dependencies. In multiple resource groups with dependencies or sequential processing, the user can ensure that one is started before the next one.

Poorly designed scripts can cause the script to stop ( config\_too\_long ). Examine carefully the start script before you configure foreground startup. If there is any possibility of the script

stopping, use a combination of the background startup option with a startup monitor instead of foreground startup.

## 4.9.1  Configuring application controller foreground startup

The application controller startup mode parameter can be selected in the application controller configuration panel as shown in Figure 4-11. The parameter is available with the path smit sysmirror  Cluster Applications and Resources  Resources  Configure User Applications (Scripts and Monitors)  Application Controller Scripts  Add Application Controller Scripts .

Figure 4-11   Application controller configuration panel

<!-- image -->

We configure two application controllers, one for each of the resource groups of our test cluster as detailed in Example 4-3. The resource groups are in a parent/child dependency.

Example 4-3   Details for application controllers and resource groups

```
root@migr3 / # cllsserv -h Name Start Script      Stop Script Startup mode db_app   /HA/db_start.sh   /HA/db_stop.sh foreground ihs_app  /HA/ihs_start.sh  /HA/ihs_stop.sh background root@migr3 / # root@migr3 / # clrgdependency -t'PARENT_CHILD' -sl #Parent                           Child db_rg ihs_rg root@migr3 / #

## 4.9.2  Testing application controller foreground startup

For this test, both resource groups are temporarily configured with the same home node. This way, their application scripts log messages in the same file so that you can see the detailed sequence of their start and finish.

Example 4-5 on page 164 shows the start and stop scripts. The syslog configuration is made to log the messages through the local7 facility in the /var/hacmp/log/foreground\_startup.log log file.

```
root@migr3 /HA # ls clstrmgr db_start.sh db_stop.sh    ihs_start.sh  ihs_stop.sh root@migr3 /HA # cat db_start.sh #!/bin/ksh fp="local7.info" file="`expr "//$0" : '.*/\([^/]*\)'`" # cleanup if [ -f /ihsfs/db.lck ]; then rm /ihsfs/db.lck; fi logger -t"$file" -p$fp "Starting up DB...

```

Example 4-5   Dummy start and stop scripts

With the db\_app application controller in the background, the APP startup script is launched before the DB startup script returns as shown in Example 4-6.

Example 4-6   Startup script markers in background mode

| Apr 25   | 13:12:21 migr3 local7:info db_start.sh: Starting up DB...   |

| Apr 25   | 13:13:11 migr3 local7:info db_start.sh: DB is running!      |

You can see in Example 4-7 the state of the resource groups at various moments interlaced with the messages of the startup scripts.

## 4.10 Disk management in PowerHA SystemMirror

You cannot use standard AIX LVM commands for disks that are configured in the cluster. PowerHA SystemMirror C-SPOC provides the same LVM functionality as standard AIX LVM. We introduce the Cluster Logical Volume Manager (CLVM) and describe how to perform the typical daily LVM tasks.

The basic parameters for the CLVM commands are the same as the corresponding AIX LVM commands. If you are in doubt, check the man pages for the normal LVM command.

## 4.10.1  Adding a disk to the cluster nodes

We describe how to add a disk to the cluster nodes:

1. Create the LUN and map it to the cluster nodes.
2. Run cfgmgr on all nodes, one-by-one.
3. Check for the SCSI Reserve policy by using lsattr -El hdiskX . If the reserve\_policy is not set to no\_reserve , change it by using chdev -a reserve\_policy=no\_reserve -l hdiskX . Y ou have to perform this step on all cluster nodes.
4. Create the Physical Volume Identifier by running the chdev -l hdiskX pv=yes command on all nodes.

## 4.10.2  Creating a shared volume group

We show how to create a shared volume group:

1. Start smit cspoc , and select Storage  Volume Groups  Create a Volume Group . See Figure 4-13 on page 168.

2. Select the node names where you want to create the volume group. By default, you have to select all nodes.
3. Select the disk. PowerHA C-SPOC shows the physical volume ID (PVID) and the disk name to help you.
4. Choose the type of volume group. We suggest scalable volume groups.
5. Optional: You can provide a resource group name. You can select one of the existing resource groups or if you enter a new resource group name, C-SPOC creates a resource group. However, this method is not the best way to create a resource group.

6. Type the volume group name.
7. Enter the typical volume group parameters (you can leave the default value):
3. -Physical partition (PP) size
4. -Max PPs per VG
5. -Max Logical Volumes
6. -Enable Strict Mirror Pools
7. -Mirror Pool name. Check 'Cross-site mirroring and AIX LVM Mirror pools' on page 183.
8. Supply the major number. The major number must be available on all nodes. For more information about the major number, see 'Creating data volume groups and file systems' on page 108.
9. Select Enable Fast Disk Takeover or Concurrent Access:
10. -Enable Fast Disk Takeover: This option is the normal shared enhanced concurrent volume group.

- -Concurrent Access: Parallel disk access for Oracle RAC. This option is used only with the concurrent resource group.
- 10.If you use Concurrent Access, you can set this volume group as a critical one. For more information about critical volume groups, see 'Critical volume groups (voting disks) for Oracle RAC' on page 192.
- 11.If you selected a resource group or created a resource group, you must verify and synchronize the cluster. Start smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration .

Important: If you make any changes in the resource group configuration, you must verify and synchronize the cluster.

## 4.10.3  Adding a disk to a shared volume group

We show how to add a disk to a shared volume group:

1. Start smit cspoc . Select Storage  Volume Groups  Set Characteristics of a Volume Group  Add a Volume to a Volume Group . See Figure 4-14.

## 4.10.18 Replacing a cluster disk

PowerHA SystemMirror C-SPOC provides an easy to use method to exchange a broken disk for a new disk in a shared volume group. In a disk failure, execute the following steps:

1. Configure a new disk or LUN to the cluster nodes. See 'Adding a disk to the cluster nodes' on page 167.
2. -The disk must be the same size or larger than the source disk regardless of the used space in the source.
3. -It cannot be a volume group member.
2. Start smit cspoc and select Storage  Physical Volumes  Cluster Disk Replacement . See Figure 4-28.
3. Select the hard disk to replace.
4. Select the destination disk.

The Cluster Disk Replacement performs the following steps:

- Adds the destination disk to the volume group
- Moves all data from the source disk to the new disk by using LVM mirroring
- Removes the failed disk from the resource group

## 4.10.20 Showing the disk UUID

The Universal Unique ID (UUID) is a low-level disk identifier that is used in the Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) Storage Framework. UUID is based on an Open Software Foundation Distributed Computing Environment standard. This ID can be useful for analyzing low-level traces. You can display the disk UUID by running smit cspoc and selecting Storage  Physical Volumes  Show UUID for a Physical Volume . See Figure 4-29 for more details.

## 4.10.21 Renaming a physical volume

Managing a high number of disks can be a daunting task. Before PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1, the only way to match the hdisk numbers between the nodes is by checking the PVIDs. If you have more than 10 hdisks, this task is challenging.

The new physical volume rename function provides a convenient method to manage cluster disks. You can rename any of the shared disks from hdisk X to any meaningful name that you want to use. Therefore, you can have a common hard disk naming scheme in the cluster. Follow these steps to rename a physical volume:

1. Start smit cspoc and select Storage  Physical Volumes  Rename a Physical Volume . See Figure 4-30 on page 183.
2. Select the hdisk to rename from the pickup list. You can rename only shared disks that are not in a volume group.
3. Enter the new disk name.
4. For Change all Physical Volumes with this PVID, select yes . With this option, C-SPOC changes the name of the hdisk on all nodes regardless of the current disk name.

## 4.11  Cross-site mirroring and AIX LVM Mirror pools

The AIX LVM Mirror Pools feature helps to maintain the physical layout of the LVM mirrors. It is an AIX feature since Version 6.1. We show how to use LVM Mirror Pools in the PowerHA environment.

The Mirror pools feature supports two types of operation modes: synchronous and asynchronous. We focus on synchronous mirror pools because async and remote mirror pools require PowerHA SystemMirror Extended Edition.

## 4.11.1 Introducing PowerHA with Cross-site mirroring

With LVM mirror pools, you can create a multiple site disaster-proof cluster by using PowerHA SystemMirror Standard Edition. The basic configuration is the same as a local cluster. The only difference is that you have two storage subsystems (one on each location) and you have to set up AIX mirroring for all shared volume groups. In a site failure, the surviving nodes still have access to the local copy of the shared data; therefore, they can perform a successful takeover.

Figure 4-31   Cross-site mirroring solution with PowerHA SystemMirror

<!-- image -->

However, there are some important limitations:

- Requires a storage subsystem on each site.
- Requires a reliable, fast SAN and network connection between the sites.
- The servers must connect to the same logical network, and they must have the same subnet and default gateway.
- The maximum distance between the computers is limited. If the distance is longer than 30 - 50 kilometers, the storage-based mirroring performs better.
- You cannot use storage-based mirroring such as the IBM DS8000 Geomirror feature.
- Geographic Logical Volume Manager (GLVM) and asynchronous remote mirror pools are not supported in PowerHA SystemMirror Standard Edition.

Important: You cannot mirror the repository disk, and in a site or storage subsystem failure, you have to rely on the repository disk resilience.

IBM PowerHA SystemMirror Enterprise Edition provides a long-distance disaster recovery solution without the preceding limitation.

When you set up a cross-site mirroring configuration, ensure that the following characteristics are true:

- All shared volume groups are fully mirrored.
- The mirror copies are on the corresponding storage subsystem.
- Quorum checking is turned off for the shared volume groups ( chvg -Q n vgname ).
- After a full site down event, you have to check the volume group reintegration and you might need to manually synchronize the volume group mirrors.

## 4.11.2  The multiple storage mirroring problem

By default, AIX does not track the physical locations of the hdisk devices during LVM mirroring, logical volume, file system creation, and an extension operation. LVM ensures that each copy of a logical volume is on a separate hdisk but it does not matter where a certain hdisk is located. Figure 4-32 shows an example without using AIX Mirror Pools. LVM mirrors the logical volumes without taking care of a disk physical location.

Figure 4-32 LVM mirroring without AIX Mirror Pools

The mirror pools are user-defined tags for physical volumes. If you specify them for all disks in a volume group, AIX lays out the mirror copies according to this label. In Example 4-11, hdisk3 and hdisk5 are in the same storage in our computer data room. We label them as mirror1 . Hdisk4 and hdisk5 are in another building; we use the mirror2 label to differentiate them. When we create our shared, mirrored logical volumes (for example, bubbalv ), we specify LVM to use the mirror1 and mirror2 mirror pools.

## 4.11.3  Assigning the mirror pool names

You can assign the mirror pool names in several ways, for example, when you create or extend a volume group. All standard AIX LVM and PowerHA C-SPOC LVM commands support the mirror pool names:

1. Start smit cspoc and select Storage  Volume Groups  Manage Mirror Pools for Volume Groups  Add Disks to a Mirror Pool .
2. Select the mirror pool. If it is a new mirror pool, choose &lt;New&gt; .
3. In the smit panel (Figure 4-33 on page 187), enter the name of the new mirror pool.
4. Select the disks to add. Press F4 for the list of available, untagged disks.

Figure 4-33   Add disks to a mirror pool

<!-- image -->

## 4.11.4  Extending a volume group

When you extend a volume group, you can specify the mirror pool names for the new disks. Be careful to extend the volume group with disks from only one mirror pool at a time:

1. Start smit cspoc , and select Storage  Volume Groups  Set Characteristics of a Volume Group  Add a Volume to a Volume Group .
2. Select the volume group to extend.
3. Select the physical volumes to add. Select disks from only one storage pool at the same time.
4. Press F4 and select the existing mirror pool name for the new disks. See Figure 4-34 on page 188.

## 4.11.5  Checking the mirror pool assignments

You can check the mirror pool assignments with the lspv -P , lsvg -P vgname , and lslv lvname commands. See Example 4-12.

## 4.11.6  Creating a mirrored logical volume with mirror pools

After your disks are assigned to mirror pools, you can specify the mirror pools instead of the physical volume names in all LVM mirroring-related commands:

1. Start smit cspoc and select Storage  Logical Volumes  Add a Logical Volume .
2. Choose the volume group to contain the new logical volume.
3. Specify the hard disks for the logical volume or leave it Auto-select.
4. Fill out the dialog with the usual logical volume parameters, including the number of mirror copies.
5. In the bottom of the SMIT panel, select the mirror pool names for the first, second, and third copies. See Figure 4-35 on page 190.

## 4.12  Critical volume groups (voting disks) for Oracle RAC

The PowerHA SystemMirror critical volume group function provides multiple node disk heartbeat functionality for the Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) voting disk. This feature is new in PowerHA 7.1; it is a replacement for the old Multi-Node Disk Heart Beat technology.

Critical volume groups safeguard the Oracle RAC voting disks. PowerHA continuously monitors the read-write accessibility of the voting disks. You can set up one of the following recovery actions if you lose access to a volume group:

- Notify only.
- Halt the node.
- Fence the node so that the node remains up but it cannot access the Oracle database.
- Shut down cluster services and bring all resource groups offline.

Important: The critical volume groups and the Multi-Node Disk Heart Beat do not replace the SAN-based disk heartbeat. These different technologies are used for separate purposes.

Do not use critical volume groups instead of the SAN-based heartbeat.

If you have Oracle RAC, have at least one designated volume group for voting. Follow these steps to configure a critical volume group:

1. You have to set up a concurrent resource group for two or more nodes:
2. -Startup policy: Online on all available nodes
3. -Fallover policy: Bring offline
4. -Fallback policy: Never fallback
2. Create an enhanced concurrent volume group, which is accessible for all nodes in the resource group. This volume group stores the Oracle RAC voting files.
3. Add the volume group to the concurrent resource group.
4. Synchronize your cluster.
5. Start smit cspoc and select Storage  Volume Groups  Manage Critical Volume Groups  Mark a Volume Group as Critical .
6. Select the volume group from the pickup list.
7. Configure the failure action: Start smit cspoc and select Storage  Volume Groups  Manage Critical Volume Groups  Configure failure actions for Critical Volume Groups .
8. Select the volume group.
9. Select the recovery action on the loss of disk access:
13. -Notify Only
14. -Halt the node
15. -Fence the node
16. -Shutdown Cluster Services and bring all Resource Groups Offline
17. 10.Synchronize the cluster.

Important: If you change the critical volume groups, verify and synchronize the cluster.

## 4.13  File collections

PowerHA SystemMirror provides cluster-wide file synchronization capabilities through C-SPOC file collection functions. A file collection is a user-defined set of files and synchronization rules.

PowerHA provides three ways to propagate your files:

- Manually: You can synchronize your files manually at any time. The files are copied from the local node to the remote one.
- Automatically during cluster verification and synchronization: The files are propagated from the node where you start the PowerHA verification.

- Automatically when changes are detected: PowerHA checks the file collection on all nodes periodically. If a file changed, PowerHA synchronizes this file across the cluster. Y ou can set up a timer for how frequently PowerHA checks the file collections.

PowerHA retains the permissions, ownership, and time stamp of the file and propagates them to the remote nodes. You can specify filenames, wildcard filenames, and directories. You cannot add the following information:

- Symbolic links
- Wildcard directory names
- Pipes
- Sockets
- Device files ( /dev/* )
- ODM files from /etc/objrepos/* and /etc/es/objrepos/*
- Files from the /proc directory

Always use the full path names. Each file can be added to one file collection only, except those files that automatically are added to the HACMP\_Files collection. The files must not exist on the remote nodes; PowerHA creates them during the first synchronization.

PowerHA creates a backup copy of the modified files during synchronization on all nodes. These backups are stored in the /var/hacmp/filebackup directory. Only one previous version is retained and you can only restore them manually.

The file collection logs are stored in the /var/hacmp/log/clutils.log file.

Important: It is your responsibility to ensure that files on the local node (where you start the propagation) are the most recent and are not corrupted.

## 4.13.1 Predefined file collections

PowerHA provides two file collections by default: Configuration\_Files and HACMP\_Files. None of them is set up for automatic synchronization by default. You can enable them by setting either the 'Propagate files during cluster synchronization' or 'Propagate files automatically when changes are detected' option to Yes in the SMIT Change/Show a file collection menu. See 'Changing a file collection' on page 197.

## Configuration\_Files

This collection contains the essential AIX configuration files:

- /etc/hosts
- /etc/snmpd.conf
- /etc/services
- /etc/snmpdv3.conf
- /etc/inetd.conf
- /etc/rc.net
- /usr/es/sbin/cluster/netmon.cf
- /etc/cluster/rhosts
- /usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc/clhosts
- /usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc/clinfo.rc

You can easily add files to or remove files from this collection. For more information, see 'Adding files to a file collection' on page 198.

## HACMP\_Files

This file collection automatically collects all user-defined scripts from the PowerHA configuration. If you define any of the following files in your cluster configuration, these files are automatically included in the HACMP\_Files file collection:

- Application server start script
- Application server stop script
- Event notify script
- Pre-event script
- Post-event script
- Event error recovery script
- Application monitor notify script
- Application monitor cleanup script
- Application monitor restart script
- Pager text message file
- SNA Link start and stop scripts
- X.25 Link start and stop scripts
- HA tape support start script
- HA tape support stop script
- User-defined event recovery program
- Custom snapshot method script

We show an example of a file collection. Our cluster has an application server, DB2. Its start script is /usr/ha/db2.start and its stop script is /usr/ha/db2.stop . Also, we have a custom post-event script for the node\_up event that is called /usr/ha/post.node\_up . These three files are automatically added to the HACMP\_Files file collection when we defined them during HACMP configuration. You can check that the files are added:

1. Start SMIT PowerHA file collection management by entering smit cspoc and selecting File Collections  Change/Show a File Collection .
2. Select HACMP\_Files from the pop-up list and press Enter.
3. Scroll down to the Collection files field and press F4. As you can see in Figure 4-38 on page 196, the application start and stop scripts and the post-event command are automatically added to this file collection.

Figure 4-38   HACMP\_Files file collection

<!-- image -->

Important: You cannot add or remove files directly to this file collection. If you start to use the HACMP\_Files collection, ensure that your scripts can work correctly on all nodes.

If you do not want to synchronize all user-defined scripts or they are not the same on all nodes, disable this file collection and create another one that includes only the required files.

## 4.13.2 Managing file collections

We describe how you can create, modify, and remove a file collection.

## Adding a file collection

We show how to add a file collection:

1. Start SMIT by entering smit cspoc . Select File Collection .

Or, you can start PowerHA File Collection Management by entering smit cm\_filecollection\_menu .

2. Select Manage File Collections  Add a File Collection .
3. Supply the requested information (see Figure 4-39 on page 197):
3. -File Collection Name: Unique name for file collection.
4. -File Collection Description: A short description of this file collection.
5. -Propagate files during cluster synchronization: If you set this value to yes, PowerHA propagates this file collection during cluster synchronization. This option is a

convenient solution for cluster-related files. For example, your application startup scripts automatically synchronize after you change the cluster configuration.

- -Propagate files automatically when changes are detected: If you select yes, PowerHA checks regularly the files in this collection. If any of them changed, it repropagates them.

If both of the options are left to No, no automatic synchronization takes place.

## 4.14  Replacing the repository disk

If you encounter a hardware error on the repository disk or you have to move it to a new storage system, follow these steps:

Minimum software levels: The 'repository disk replacement' function is not available in the HA 7.1.1 base code. The following minimum software levels are required for repository disk replacement:

- AIX 6.1 TL7 SP3
- AIX 7.1 TL1 SP3
- PowerHA 7.1.1 SP1
1. Ensure that you have a new shared disk that is accessible by all cluster nodes. See 'Adding a disk to the cluster nodes' on page 167.
2. Go to smit sysmirror and select Problem Determination Tools  Select a new Cluster repository disk .
3. Select the new repository disk by pressing F4. See Figure 4-44 on page 202.

## 4.15  C-SPOC cluster user and group management

PowerHA SystemMirror C-SPOC provides an easy-to use interface for cluster-wide user management. You do not have to manually synchronize the user settings between the cluster hosts. It supports both local and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication. We describe the local user management only. For LDAP , see 4.16, 'Federated security for cluster-wide security management' on page 208.

The C-SPOC user and group management use the clustered, multiple node version of the standard AIX user and group management commands. All C-SPOC commands use the same parameters as their stand-alone counterparts. The following functions are implemented:

- Add a user
- Change a user
- Remove a user
- List users
- Add a group
- Change a group
- Remove a group
- List groups
- Change your password
- Change a cluster user password
- Manage the users who can change their cluster-wide password

When you use smit cspoc and select Security and Users , you have to select the nodes by the resource group. With this method, you can create users and groups for a specific resource group or application. For example, if you have a 3-node cluster, and one resource group of your application is configured on only two nodes, you can create users who can log on to only these two nodes.

## 4.15.1  Setting up cluster-wide password management with C-SPOC

If you plan to use C-SPOC user and password management, you have to change the default AIX passwd command to the / usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clpasswd command:

1. Start smit cspoc and select Security and Users  Passwords in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster  Modify System Password Utility .
2. Press F4 and select Link to Cluster Password Utility . See Figure 4-45 on page 203.

Figure 4-45   Modify the system password utility

<!-- image -->

## 4.15.2  Enabling cluster-wide password management for a user

You have to enable the cluster-wide password management for the users; otherwise, the users can have different passwords on the cluster nodes. Follow these steps:

1. Start smit cspoc and select Security and Users  Passwords in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster  Manage List of Users Allowed to Change Password .
2. Press F4 for the list of available users.
3. Select individual users by pressing F7 to enable the user for cluster-wide password management. You have to reselect the previously enabled users because only the actual selected users are allowed to use the cluster password management feature.
4. Alternatively, you can select ALL\_USERS to enable this feature for all users. See Figure 4-46 on page 204.

Figure 4-46   Enable users to have cluster-wide passwords

## 4.15.3  Listing users to use cluster-wide password management

To list the users whom are enabled for cluster-wide password management execute smit cspoc , then select Security and Users  Passwords in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster  List Users Allowed to Change Password .

## 4.15.4  Adding a user to the cluster

We show how to add a user to the cluster:

1. Start smit cspoc and select Security and Users  Users in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster  Add a User to the Cluster .
2. Select the authentication and registry mode: LOCAL(FILES) .
3. Select nodes by resource group: If you leave it empty, PowerHA creates the user on all cluster nodes. Otherwise, select a resource group, and the C-SPOC creates the user only on the nodes where the resource group is configured.
4. Enter the user name and all other pertinent information. See Figure 4-47 on page 205. Leave the User ID field empty so that PowerHA can select an ID that is free on all nodes.

5. If you want to enable cluster-wide password management for the user, follow the steps in 'Enabling cluster-wide password management for a user' on page 203.

## 4.16 Federated security for cluster-wide security management

The AIX operating system provides a rich set of security capabilities. The goal of federated security is to enable the security administration of AIX security features across the cluster.

Federated security addresses Lightweight Access Protocol (LDAP), role-based access control (RBAC), and Encrypted file system (EFS) integration into cluster management.

Through the federated security cluster, users are able to manage roles and the encryption of data across the cluster.

## 4.16.1 Federated security components

Federated security integrates components and features such as LDAP and RBAC into the cluster management. We look into the functional value of each component in the cluster management as shown in Figure 4-50.

Figure 4-50   Federated security components

<!-- image -->

## LDAP

The LDAP method is used by cluster nodes to allow centralized security authentication and access to user and group information.

The following information is stored by the federated security at LDAP:

- PowerHA roles: As part of LDAP client configuration through PowerHA (details of PowerHA roles and LDAP client configuration are explained in the following section).
- EFS keystore: Exports EFS keystore data to LDAP . Stores the local user and group keystores to LDAP when EFS is enabled through PowerHA. Details are in 'EFS' on page 210.
- Stores user and group account information for authorization.

Details of the LDAP server and client configuration are explained in 'Configuring LDAP' on page 211.

The following supported LDAP servers can be configured for federated security:

- IBM Tivoli Director server
- Windows Active Directory server

All cluster nodes must be configured with the LDAP server and the client filesets. PowerHA provides options to configure the LDAP server and client across all cluster nodes.

SSL: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection is mandatory for binding LDAP clients to servers. Remember to configure SSL in the cluster nodes.

## LDAP

The LDAP server and client configuration is provided through the PowerHA smitty option and the System Director PowerHA plug-in.

For the LDAP server and client setup, SSL must be configured. The SSL connection is mandatory for binding LDAP clients to servers.

LDAP server: The LDAP server needs to be configured on all cluster nodes. If there is an existing LDAP server, it can be incorporated into PowerHA for federated security usage.

## RBAC

Cluster administration is an important aspect of high availability operations, and security in the cluster is an inherent part of most system administration functions. Federated security integrates the AIX RBAC features to enhance the operational security.

During LDAP client configuration, four PowerHA defined roles are created in LDAP:

- ha\_admin : Provides ADMIN authorization for the relevant cluster functionality. For example, taking a cluster snapshot is under administrator authorization.
- ha\_op : Provides OPERATOR authorization for the relevant cluster functionality. For example, 'move cluster resource group' is under operator authorization.
- ha\_mon : Provides MONITOR authorization for the relevant cluster functionality. For example, the command clRGinfo is under monitor authorization.
- ha\_view : Provides VIEW authorization. It has all read permissions for the cluster functionality.

These roles can be assigned to the user to provide restricted access to the cluster functionality based on the role.

Roles: PowerHA roles are created while you configure the LDAP client in the cluster nodes.

## EFS

The Encrypted File System (EFS) enables users on the system to encrypt their data in the journaled file system 2 (JFS2) through their individual keystores. The keys are stored in a cryptographically protected keystore. On a successful login, the user keys are loaded into the kernel and associated with the process credentials.

From the federated security perspective, the EFS keystores are stored in LDAP . There is an option to store the keystores through a shared file system in the cluster environment if LDAP is not configured in the cluster.

Tip : Store the EFS keystore in LDAP . As an option, if the LDAP environment is not configured, the keystore can be stored in a Network File System (NFS) mounted file system. In order to avoid the risk of grace period expired during fallover event of the NFSv4 resource group, the resource group run-time policies from the default of parallel into serial release and acquisition order is suggested. This will enforce the NFS un-mounting first on local node before the resource group fallover. This helps avoid NFS cross-mount.

## 4.16.2  Federated security configuration requirement

The following prerequisites are necessary for a complete federated security environment:

- LDAP Configuration:
- -DB2 V9.7
- -GSKit filesets, preferably version 8
- -LDAP Server filesets (Tivoli Director server 6.3 version)
- -LDAP Client filesets (Tivoli Director server 6.3 version)
- RBAC configuration
- EFS environment

The filesets for RBAC and EFS are available by default in AIX 6.1 and later versions, and nothing specific is required. The challenge is to configure LDAP .

## Configuring LDAP

Use the following steps to install the LDAP configuration:

1. Install and Configure DB2.
2. Install GSkit filesets.
3. Install Tivoli Director server (LDAP server and client) filesets.

## Installing DB2

We provide the DB2 installation steps as shown in Example 4-13.

Example 4-13   DB2 installation steps

# ./db2\_install

Default directory for installation of products - /opt/IBM/db2/V9.7 Do you want to choose a different directory to install [yes/no] ? no Specify one of the following keywords to install DB2 products. ESE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Select ESE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CLIENT RTCL Enter 'help' to redisplay product names. Enter 'quit' to exit. ***********************************************************

```
ESE <<<< selected option >>>>> DB2 installation is being initialized. Total number of tasks to be performed: 46 Total estimated time for all tasks to be performed: 2369 Task #1 start Description: Checking license agreement acceptance
```

```
Estimated time 1 second(s) Task #1 end Task #47 end The execution completed successfully.
```

## GSkit filesets

Ensure that the GSkit filesets are installed in both server and client nodes, basically in all cluster nodes. See Example 4-14 on page 212.

Example 4-14   GSkit fileset installation

```
Installing GSkit (64-bit) installp -acgXd . GSKit8.gskcrypt64.ppc.rte installp -acgXd . GSKit8.gskssl64.ppc.rte Installing GSkit (32-bit) installp -acgXd . GSKit8.gskcrypt32.ppc.rte installp -acgXd . GSKit8.gskssl32.ppc.rte Install AIX Certificate and SSL base installp -acgXd . gsksa.rte installp -acgXd . gskta.rte
```

Ensure that the SSL filesets are configured as shown in Example 4-15.

## Example 4-15 SSL filesets

```
# lslpp -l | grep ssl GSKit8.gskssl32.ppc.rte   8.0.14.7  COMMITTED  IBM GSKit SSL Runtime With GSKit8.gskssl64.ppc.rte   8.0.14.7  COMMITTED  IBM GSKit SSL Runtime With openssl.base            0.9.8.1100  COMMITTED  Open Secure Socket Layer openssl.license          0.9.8.801  COMMITTED  Open Secure Socket License openssl.man.en_US       0.9.8.1100  COMMITTED  Open Secure Socket Layer openssl.base            0.9.8.1100  COMMITTED  Open Secure Socket Layer
```

## Tivoli Directory Server (LDAP) filesets

We show the Tivoli Directory Server (LDAP) filesets as shown in Example 4-16.

## Example 4-16   LDAP client and server filesets

```
# lslpp -l | grep idsldap idsldap.clt32bit63.rte 6.3.0.3 COMMITTED Directory Server - 32 bit idsldap.clt64bit63.rte 6.3.0.3 COMMITTED Directory Server - 64 bit idsldap.clt_max_crypto32bit63.rte idsldap.clt_max_crypto64bit63.rte idsldap.cltbase63.adt 6.3.0.3 COMMITTED Directory Server - Base Client idsldap.cltbase63.rte 6.3.0.3 COMMITTED Directory Server - Base Client
```

More information: For complete DB2 and LDAP configuration details, see this website:

https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home/wiki/PowerHA%20S ystemMirror/page/PowerHA%20Cluster%20with%20Federated%20Security?lang=en

## 4.16.3 Federated security configuration details

After the required filesets are installed, the federated security can be configured by using the following two options:

- PowerHA smitty panel
- PowerHA SystemMirror PowerHA plug-in for Systems Director

## LDAP configuration

The LDAP configuration by using the smitty panel can be reached via System Management (C-SPOC)  LDAP as shown in Figure 4-51 on page 213.

Figure 4-51   LDAP configuration panel through C-SPOC

<!-- image -->

## LDAP server configuration

Under the LDAP server configuration, two options are provided (Figure 4-52 on page 214):

- Configure a new LDAP server
- Add an existing LDAP server

If an LDAP server is already configured, the cluster nodes can use the existing LDAP server or configure a new LDAP server.

Figure 4-52   LDAP server configuration option

<!-- image -->

## Configuring a new LDAP server

To configure a new LDAP server (Figure 4-53 on page 215), enter smitty hacmp and select System Management (C-SPOC)  LDAP  LDAP Server  Configure a new LDAP server .

Figure 4-53   New LDAP server configuration

<!-- image -->

## Consider these key points:

- The existence of any LDAP instance is verified. The configuration continues only if the instance name is not ldapdb2. Have only one instance for federated security purposes.
- Internally, the configuration creates a peer-to-peer configuration to avoid LDAP instance failure. Therefore, a minimum of two nodes are expected as input.
- The configuration loads the local user and group information into LDAP .
- The configuration loads the RBAC AIX tables into LDAP .
- The configuration loads the EFS keystore that is defined for users and groups into LDAP .
- Various data trees that are created in LDAP are in the /etc/security/ldap/sectoldif.cfg file.

## Encryption: The encryption seed must be a minimum of 12 characters.

The success of the LDAP configuration can be verified by using the ODM command in Example 4-17.

Example 4-17   ODM command to verify LDAP configuration for federated security

# odmget -q "group=LDAPServer and name=ServerList" HACMPLDAP

## HACMPLDAP:

group = "LDAPServer"

type = "IBMExisting"

name = "ServerList"

value = "selma06,selma07"

## Adding an existing LDAP server configuration

To add an existing LDAP server (Figure 4-54), enter smitty hacmp and select System Management (C-SPOC)  LDAP  LDAP Server  Add an existing LDAP server .

Figure 4-54   Adding an existing LDAP Server

<!-- image -->

Consider these key points:

- Temporarily, the LDAP client is configured to verify the LDAP server input parameters. The compatible LDAP client fileset must be at least at version 6.2.
- It adds the user/group RBAC tables and EFS keystore into the existing LDAP server.

The success of adding an existing LDAP server is verified with the ODM command as shown in Example 4-18.

```
# odmget -q "group=LDAPServer and name=ServerList" HACMPLDAP HACMPLDAP: group = "LDAPServer" type = "IBMExisting" name = "ServerList" value = "selma06,selma07"
```

Example 4-18   ODM command to verify the existing LDAP server configuration for federated security

## LDAP client configuration

To configure the LDAP client (Figure 4-55 on page 217 and Figure 4-56 on page 217), enter smitty hacmp and select System Management (C-SPOC)  LDAP  LDAP Client  Configure LDAP client .

Figure 4-55   LDAP client configuration

<!-- image -->

Figure 4-56   LDAP client configuration parameters

<!-- image -->

## Consider these key points:

- Ensure that the LDAP client filesets and GSkit filesets are installed as described in 'Federated security configuration requirement' on page 211. The minimum compatible LDAP client filesets must be version 6.2.
- The RBAC is configured during client configuration. The PowerHA defined roles are created in the LDAP server.
- It generates SSL keys, extracts the server certificate, and binds with SSL as part of the LDAP client configuration.
- It enables the home directory automatically at user login, which is required by LDAP users.

Verify the client configuration by using the ODM command as shown in Example 4-19.

```
# odmget -q "group=LDAPClient and name=ServerList" HACMPLDAP
```

Example 4-19   ODM command to verify LDAP client configuration

```
HACMPLDAP: group = "LDAPClient" type = "ITDSClinet" name = "ServerList" value = "selma06,selma07"
```

Also, the client configuration can be verified by checking the LDAP client daemon status by using the command as shown in Example 4-20.

```
# ps -eaf | grep secldapclntd root  4194478        1   2 04:30:09      -  0:10 /usr/sbin/secldapclntd
```

Example 4-20 Verify the client daemon status after LDAP client configuration

## RBAC

During the LDAP client configuration, the PowerHA defined roles are created in the LDAP server.

Verify the configuration of the RBAC roles in the LDAP server by using the ODM command as shown in Example 4-21.

```
# odmget -q "group=LDAPClient and name=RBACConfig" HACMPLDAP HACMPLDAP: group = "LDAPClient" type = "RBAC" name = "RBACConfig" value = "YES"
```

Example 4-21   ODM command to verify RBAC configuration into LDAP server

Verify the four PowerHA defined roles that are created in LDAP as shown in Example 4-22.

```
# lsrole -a ALL | grep ha*
```

Example 4-22   Roles that are defined by PowerHA

```
ha_admin ha_op ha_mon ha_view
```

Example 4-22 shows that the RBAC is configured and can be used by the cluster users and groups. The usage scenario of roles by cluster users and groups are defined in the following section.

## EFS

The EFS management scenario is shown in the flow chart in Figure 4-57 on page 219.

Figure 4-57   EFS management

<!-- image -->

To configure the EFS management configuration (Figure 4-58), enter smitty hacmp and select System Management (C-SPOC)  Security and Users  EFS Management .

Figure 4-58   EFS management

<!-- image -->

Under EFS management, the options are provided to enable EFS and to store keystores either in LDAP or a shared file system.

Important: Federated security mandates that the LDAP configuration creates roles and stores EFS keystores. You can store EFS keystores under the shared file system only if LDAP is not configured.

## EFS keystore in LDAP

If LDAP is configured, only the LDAP option is available to store the EFS keystore (Figure 4-59).

Figure 4-59   EFS keystore mode

<!-- image -->

Important: The volume group and service IP are invalid and ignored in LDAP mode.

## Consider these key points:

- Enables EFS by using the /usr/sbin/efsenable -a -d cn=aixdata,o=ibm command.
- Prompts the user to enter the password to protect the initial keystore.

Verify the EFS enablement as understood by the cluster as shown in Example 4-23.

```
# odmget  -q "group=EFSKeyStore AND name=mode"  HACMPLDAP
```

Example 4-23 ODM command to verify the EFS enablement status

```
HACMPLDAP: group = "EFSKeyStore" type = "EFS" name = "mode" value = "1"
```

## EFS keystore in a shared file system

If LDAP is not configured but you want to use EFS to encrypt the cluster data, federated security provides an option to store the EFS keystore in a shared file system.

As shown in Figure 4-13 on page 168, to enable EFS and to store the EFS keystore in the shared file system, provide the volume group and service IP details:

- The volume group to store the EFS keystore in a file system
- The service IP to mount the file system where the keystore is stored so that it is highly available to cluster nodes

Consider these key points during this configuration:

- Creates the EFS keystore file system in the specified volume group
- Creates the EFS mount point on all cluster nodes
- Creates the resource group to include the NFS exports with fallback as an NFS option
- Adds a specified volume group in the resource group
- Adds a service IP and a mount point in the resource group

Important: The file system creation, mount point, and NFS export are performed internally under the EFS keystore in a shared file system option.

Verify the configuration by using the ODM command as shown in Example 4-24.

Example 4-24   ODM command to verify EFS configuration in shared file system mode

```
# odmget  -q "group=EFSKeyStore AND name=mode"  HACMPLDAP

## 4.16.4 User and group management under federated security

From the federated security perspective, the users and groups that are created can be authenticated through LDAP .

## User management

We show user management in PowerHA (Figure 4-60 on page 222).

Figure 4-60   User management

<!-- image -->

To reach user management, enter smitty hacmp and select System Management (C-SPOC)  Security and Users  Users in an PowerHA SystemMirror cluster .

To create a user, you can set the authentication and registry mode to either LDAP or local as shown in Figure 4-61.

Figure 4-61   User creation with registry mode as LDAP or local

<!-- image -->

The new user can be assigned with the PowerHA roles that are created as part of the federated security LDAP configuration as shown in Figure 4-62 on page 223.

Similar to user management, group management can set the registry and authentication mode as LDAP or local as shown in Figure 4-61 on page 222.

## 4.17  IBM System Director plug-in update

The PowerHA Standard Edition configuration can be done via the System Director SysMirror Plug-in.

The architecture of the IBM System Director SysMirror Plug-in is shown for quick reference in Figure 4-64.

Figure 4-64   System Director architecture that involves the PowerHA plug-in

<!-- image -->

Figure 4-65 on page 225 shows the plug-in compatibility matrix with System Director versions.

Figure 4-65   System Director support matrix

<!-- image -->

The SystemMirror Director Advanced Manager is the plug-in that needs to be deployed at the System Director. The Agent Plug-in needs to be deployed at the cluster nodes.

The System Director plug-in offers these advantages:

- A single, centralized view into all PowerHA SystemMirror clusters:
- -Centralized and secure access point
- -Single sign-on (SSO) capability
- Scheduling

For example, functionality, such as Create Cluster and Create Resource Group, can be scheduled.

- Event tracking
- For example, cluster availability can be monitored by using event monitors and event automation plans.
- Multiple cluster management
- Easy to configure through wizards

## Smart Assists for PowerHA SystemMirror

Smart Assists for PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 manages a collection of PowerHA SystemMirror components that you identify to support a particular application. You can view these collections of PowerHA SystemMirror components as a single entity. In PowerHA SystemMirror, the entity is represented by an application name.

This chapter explains how to install and configure a hot standby 2-node IBM PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 cluster by using two of the new Smart Assists that are introduced in this version. Also, there is an example of using the Smart Assist for IBM Tivoli Storage Manager servers. The lab cluster smass is used for the examples with the participating nodes smass1 and smass2.

This chapter describes how to install and configure the following Smart Assist applications:

- Smart Assist for IBM Tivoli Storage Manager
- Smart Assist for IBM MQ Series
- Smart Assist for IBM Tivoli Directory Server

## 5.1  Installing PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist

You can install PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist from media, a hard drive, or an installation server. The media for installing PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist contains the filesets that are shown in Table 5-1.

Verify that your environment meets the specific requirements for the solution deployment before you install and use the various PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist applications, for example:

- The node has at least 5 MB of space in the /usr directory.
- The systems run PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 SP 02, or later.
- The environment uses AIX Version 7.1 with the 7100-01 SP3 Technology Level, or later.
- You have a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster, shared storage, and connectivity.

Prerequisites: Read the Smart Assist manuals carefully for any application-specific prerequisite.

## 5.2  Scenario

In our scenario, we use two AIX logical partitions (LPARs) that are called smass1 and smass2. They both share the storage disk access that is used for the repository disk and data disk.

In each case that we tested, we clear the cluster configuration before installation and configure the next required PowerHA Smart Assist. The base diagram of the configuration is shown in Figure 5-1.

Figure 5-1   Configuration that is used to test PowerHA Smart Assist

<!-- image -->

Figure 5-2 on page 230 shows the cluster configuration after we create the base cluster and before we install and configure any PowerHA Smart Assist products.

```
Cluster Name: smass Cluster Connection Authentication Mode: Standard Cluster Message Authentication Mode: None Cluster Message Encryption: None Use Persistent Labels for Communication: No Repository Disk: hdisk2 Cluster IP Address: 228.1.1.46 There are 2 node(s) and 1 network(s) defined NODE smass1: Network net_ether_01 smass1  10.1.1.46 NODE smass2: Network net_ether_01 smass2  10.1.1.31 No resource groups defined

## 5.3  Smart Assist for IBM Tivoli Storage Manager

Before you start planning, you need to have a basic understanding of the different components of the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager.

## Tivoli Storage Manager server

The Tivoli Storage Manager server provides backup, archive, and space management services to the clients. You can set up multiple servers in your environment to balance storage, processor, and network resources. By using Smart Assist for Tivoli Storage Manager, you can configure the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager server instance for high availability.

## Tivoli Storage Manager client

A client node can be a workstation, a personal computer, a file server, or another IBM Tivoli Storage Manager server. The client node uses installed Tivoli Storage Manager client software and is registered with the server.

## Tivoli Storage Manager backup-archive client

With the backup-archive client, you can maintain backup versions of files, which you can use to restore the original files if they are lost or damaged. You can also archive files for long-term storage and retrieve the archived files when necessary. You can register workstations and file servers as client nodes with the Tivoli Storage Manager server.

## Tivoli Storage Manager for Space Management

Tivoli Storage Manager for Space Management provides you with space management services for workstations. The space management function is essentially a more automated version of archive. Tivoli Storage Manager for Space Management automatically migrates files that are less frequently used to server storage, freeing space on the workstation.

## Tivoli Storage Manager admin center

The Tivoli Storage Manager admin center and integrated solutions console are included in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager product distribution. They are installed with the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager server (as an optional component).

## 5.3.1  Planning for Smart Assist for Tivoli Storage Manager Server

Before you can use the Smart Assist for Tivoli Storage Manager server, review the following information:

- The Tivoli Storage Manager server instance must have the service IP that can be pinged by the Smart Assist for Tivoli Storage Manager client.
- The Tivoli Storage Manager server instance name and Tivoli Storage Manager server user name must be identical and configured on all nodes in the cluster.
- The following information is shared between the nodes in the cluster for an IBM Tivoli Storage Manager server instance:
- -Database directories
- -Instance log volumes
- -Storage pool volumes
- -Instance directory
- -Instance user directory
- Any number of Tivoli Storage Manager server instances can be configured by using the Smart Assist for Tivoli Storage Manager. However, the volume groups that are used for each Tivoli Storage Manager server instance must be different from other Tivoli Storage Manager server instances.
- When you add a Tivoli Storage Manager server instance, it must be defined in the dsm.sys and dsm.opt files in the /opt/tivoli/tsm/server/bin/tsmdiag directory on all nodes of the cluster that are used for starting, stopping, and monitoring the Tivoli Storage Manager server instance. For example, the dsm.sys file must contain the following information:
- -servername tsmsmass
- -tcpport 1500
- -commmethod tcpip
- -tcpserveraddress abc.us.com

The dsm.opt file must contain the servername tsmsmass .

Figure 5-3 on page 232 displays a typical 2-node configuration for a Tivoli Storage Manager Server.

2. Check that a shared volume group is available between the nodes. Create a file system by using Cluster Single Point of Control (C-SPOC) tools to hold the installation of the instance in the shared volume group (Example 5-2 on page 233).

```
root@smass1 / # clcmd lspv -------------------------------NODE smass1 -------------------------------hdisk0          00f61ab2f915452b                    rootvg          active hdisk3          00f74d472c0e 5965 tsmvg -------------------------------NODE smass2 -------------------------------hdisk0          00f74d47f961b168                    rootvg          active hdisk3          00f74d472c0e 5965 tsmvg
```

Example 5-2   Shared volume group for Tivoli Storage Manager instance

3. Remember to install Tivoli Storage Manager server 6.2.3 in both nodes and with the same level as shown in Example 5-3.
4. Create the same user on both nodes as the owner of the instance and make it the owner of the file system on the shared volume group. The binaries remain local and the instance is created in the shared file system as shown in Example 5-4.
5. Create the Tivoli Storage Manager server instance as a normal installation in the first node with the configuration tool dsmicfgx by using a file system in the shared disk.

```
root@smass1 / # clcmd lslpp -L tivoli.tsm.server -------------------------------NODE smass1 -------------------------------Fileset                      Level  State  Type  Description (Uninstaller) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------tivoli.tsm.server          6.2.3.0    C     F    TSM Server -------------------------------NODE smass2 -------------------------------Fileset                      Level  State  Type  Description (Uninstaller) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------tivoli.tsm.server          6.2.3.0    C     F    TSM Server
```

Example 5-3   Tivoli Storage Manager server installation verification

```
root@smass1 / # clcmd lsuser -a id home tsminst
```

Example 5-4 User that owns the file system that is used by Tivoli Storage Manager

```
-------------------------------NODE smass2 -------------------------------tsminst id=208 home=/home/tsminst -------------------------------NODE smass1 -------------------------------tsminst id=208 home=/home/tsminst root@smass1 / # root@smass1 / # chown tsminst /tsmdata
```

Complete the information with the required directories, and check Do not automatically start the server when asked.

6. Manually start the server and check that everything works as shown in Example 5-5. Stop the Tivoli Storage Manager server, unmount the share file system, and vary off the shared volume group.
7. Create the Tivoli Storage Manager server instance as a normal installation in the second node . Indicate that it is a 'backup node on a cluster configuration' so that the instance already created on the shared volume group is imported and ready to use. Ensure that the Tivoli Storage Manager server starts and works. Stop the Tivoli Storage Manager server as shown in Example 5-5. After verification, unmount the share file system and vary off the shared volume group.

```

Log data: The Smart Assist for Tivoli Storage Manager writes log data to the /var/hacmp/log/tsm\_server.log file.

## 5.4  Smart Assist for IBM MQ Series

IBM WebSphere MQ is middleware for messaging and queuing network communication. You can use WebSphere MQ to increase the speed of distributed applications by simplifying application development and testing.

WebSphere MQ runs in various platforms. WebSphere MQ applications use a consistent application programming interface (API) across all platforms. With WebSphere MQ, your applications can communicate with each other across a network of different components such as processors, subsystems, operating systems, and communication protocols.

## 5.4.1 Planning for WebSphere MQ

Install the operating system, PowerHA SystemMirror, and WebSphere MQ by using normal procedures on all systems in the cluster.

Install WebSphere MQs into internal disks (non-shared) on each of the nodes and do not share a single installation on shared disks. It is important that you run identical versions of software on all cluster nodes, except during a rolling upgrade.

When you install WebSphere MQ in a cluster, the mqm username and the mqm groupname must be created and have the same numeric value on all cluster nodes.

Figure 5-6 displays a typical 2-node configuration for a WebSphere MQ installation.

Figure 5-6   Typical 2-node WebSphere MQ cluster configuration

<!-- image -->

The smallest unit of failover for WebSphere MQ is a queue manager because you cannot move part of a queue manager without moving all of it. Place each queue manager in a separate resource group with the resources on which it depends. The resource group must contain the following resources:

- The shared volume group that is used by the queue manager
- The IP address that is used to connect to the queue manager (the service address)
- The object that represents the queue manager

Multiple queue managers: You can put multiple queue managers into the same resource groups, but they might fallover to another node together, even if the problem that causes the fallover is confined to one queue manager.

A queue manager that is used in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster must have its recovery logs and data on shared disks so that they can be accessed by a surviving node in a node failure. A node that runs a queue manager must also maintain a number of files on internal (non-shared) disks. These files include files that relate to all queue managers on the node such as the /var/mqm/mqs.ini file, and queue manager-specific files that are used to generate internal control information.

## 5.4.2  Software requirements

Your environment must run the following software to successfully implement the Smart Assist for WebSphere MQ:

- WebSphere MQ Version 7.0.1, or later
- PowerHA SystemMirror Version 7.1.1, or later

## 5.4.3  Installing WebSphere MQ

Before you install WebSphere MQ, verify that the mqm username and the mqm groupname are created and have the same numeric value on all of the cluster nodes. Set the primary group of user mqm to mqm .

To make the WebSphere MQ queue manager highly available on a node, install the following filesets from the WebSphere MQ media installer:

- mqm.base.runtime
- mqm.client.rte
- mqm.base.sdk
- mqm.java.rte
- mqm.keyman.rte
- mqm.jre.rte
- mqm.server.rte
- mqm.base.runtime
- mqm.txclient.rte

Install the required Smart Assist filesets as shown in Example 5-7.

Important: Ensure that you add /usr/mqm/bin to the global PATH environment.

## 5.4.4  Configuring WebSphere MQ

Before you can configure WebSphere MQ, verify that PowerHA SystemMirror is installed and configured on all nodes in the cluster.

## Configuring a shared disk for WebSphere MQ

A WebSphere MQ queue manager in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster requires that data files and log files are in a common named remote file system on a shared disk (Example 5-8).

To configure a shared disk to work with WebSphere MQ, complete the following steps:

1. Create a fast disk takeover-enabled volume group by using the C-SPOC utilities. This volume group is used for the data and log files of the queue manager. This volume group is managed by the PowerHA SystemMirror cluster in the same resource group as the queue manager.
2. Create a file system for data and another file system for logs by using the volume group that is created in step 1. You can use the C-SPOC utilities so that both nodes have the correct file system configuration.

Example 5-8   Share volume group for MQ installation

## Creating a queue manager for a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster

Before you can use a queue manager in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster, you must create a queue manager on one of the nodes in the cluster.

To create a queue manager for a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Select one of the nodes in the cluster on which you want to create the queue manager and log in as a root user.
2. Vary on the shared volume group and mount the data file system and log file system that you created in the shared disks, for example, /MQHA.

3. Change the owner permissions of the data file system and log file system by running the following commands:

```
chown -R mqm:mqm file_system_name chmod -R 2775 file_system_name
```

The file\_system\_name is the name of the file system.

4. As mqm user , create the queue manager as shown in Example 5-9.

Example 5-9   How to create queue manager

/usr/mqm/bin/crtmqm -md /MQHA/qmgrjcrm/data -ld /MQHA/qmgrjcrm/log qmgrjcrm where qmgrjcrm is the name of the queue manager. And check the output:

WebSphere MQ queue manager created. Directory '/MQHA/qmgrjcrm/data/qmgrjcrm' created. The queue manager is associated with installation 'Installation1'. Creating or replacing default objects for queue manager 'qmgrjcrm'. Default objects statistics : 71 created. 0 replaced. 0 failed. Completing setup. Setup completed.

5. Display the addmqinf command output as the mqm user by running the following command:

dspmqinf -o command qmgrjcrm qmgrjcrm is the name of the queue manager.

6. Verify that you populated the /var/mqm/mqs.ini file with the correct information as shown in Example 5-10.

Example 5-10   Information in mqs.ini file

```
$ cat /var/mqm/mqs.ini #********************************************************************# . . . (a few lines for this output have been omitted) #********************************************************************# DefaultPrefix=/var/mqm LogDefaults: LogDefaultPath=/var/mqm/log QueueManager: Name=qmgrjcrm Prefix=/var/mqm Directory=qmgrjcrm DataPath=/MQHA/qmgrjcrm/data/qmgrjcrm InstallationName=Installation1
```

If you did not, run the addmqinf command that is displayed as a result of running the dspmqinf command in step 5. The addmqinf command that you run is similar to the following example:

addmqinf -sQueueManager -vName=qmgrjcrm -vDirectory=qmgrjcrm -vPrefix=/var/mqm -vDataPath=/MQHA/qmgrjcrm/data/qmgrjcrm

7. Unmount the queue manager file systems and vary off the shared volume group.

Important: If you plan to create more than one qmanager, it is a good idea to create a separate directory in the shared file system for each one.

## Adding a queue manager configuration to other nodes

After you create a queue manager, you can add the configuration from the queue manager that you created to other nodes in the PowerHA SystemMirror cluster.

To add the configuration information for the queue manager to each of other nodes in the PowerHA SystemMirror cluster, complete the following steps on each of the other nodes:

1. Vary on the shared volume group and mount the queue manager data file system and log file system.
2. Add the queue manager configuration information, as mqm user , to the node by editing the /var/mqs.ini file, or by running the addmqinf command that is displayed when you run the dspmqinf -o command.
3. As the mqm user , start and stop the queue manager to verify that the configuration works correctly; see Example 5-11.
4. Unmount the queue manager data file system and log file system, and vary off the shared volume group.

```
$ /usr/mqm/bin/dspmq QMNAME(qmgrjcrm)                                          STATUS(Ended normally) $ /usr/mqm/bin/strmqm qmgrjcrm WebSphere MQ queue manager 'qmgrjcrm' starting. The queue manager is associated with installation 'Installation1'. 5 log records accessed on queue manager 'qmgrjcrm' during the log replay phase. Log replay for queue manager 'qmgrjcrm' complete.

WebSphere MQ queue manager 'qmgrjcrm' started using V7.1.0.0. $ /usr/mqm/bin/dspmq QMNAME(qmgrjcrm)                                          STATUS(Running) $ /usr/mqm/bin/endmqm qmgrjcrm Quiesce request accepted. The queue manager will stop when all outstanding work is complete. $ /usr/mqm/bin/dspmq QMNAME(qmgrjcrm)                                          STATUS(Quiescing) $ /usr/mqm/bin/dspmq QMNAME(qmgrjcrm)                                          STATUS(Ended normally)
```

## 5.5  Smart Assist for IBM Tivoli Directory Server

IBM Tivoli Directory Server is a powerful, security-rich, and standards-compliant enterprise directory for corporate intranets and the Internet. Tivoli Directory Server is the identity data foundation for the rapid development and deployment of web applications and security by including strong management, replication, and security features. Tivoli Directory Server is a powerful Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) infrastructure. It provides a foundation for deploying comprehensive identity management applications and advanced software architectures.

With the Smart Assist for Tivoli Directory Server, you can automatically configure PowerHA SystemMirror where Tivoli Directory Server is already installed.

## Smart Assist for Tivoli Directory Server concepts

Smart Assist for Tivoli Directory Server supports stand-alone directory configurations, distributed directory configurations, and peer-to-peer directory configurations.

## Stand-alone directory configuration

In a stand-alone directory configuration, there are multiple Tivoli Directory Server instances that run on a single node (Node 1). When a failure occurs in Node 1, another node (Node 2) obtains the resources of Node 1 and takes over running the Tivoli Directory Server instance. Node 2 uses the same disk set and the same IP address for the Tivoli Directory Server instance that Node 1 used. When Node 1 fails, a database instance that is created on a shared volume group is started and used by Node 2. Also, when Node 1 fails, its service IP label is taken over by Node 2.

## Distributed directory configuration

In a distributed directory configuration, there are multiple Tivoli Directory Server instances that run on each node in a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster. Each Tivoli Directory Server instance has its peer servers and replica servers that run on a node in the cluster. In a distributed directory configuration, client requests are routed to the correct Tivoli Directory Server by a proxy server that runs in a node in the cluster. The proxy server is not controlled by PowerHA SystemMirror. When a failure occurs on any of the Tivoli Directory Server instances, the instance is restarted by PowerHA SystemMirror. If a failure occurs on a node in the cluster, PowerHA SystemMirror is not supported because fallover and fallback are handled by the Tivoli Directory Server. When a failure occurs for a node and data is replicated into a different Tivoli Directory Server, there is no need for a shared volume group or service IP label in the cluster.

## Peer-to-peer directory configuration

In a peer-to-peer directory configuration, the proxy server is not available, and there is no data partition and data distribution between the Tivoli Directory Server instances. However, the Tivoli Directory Server instances have access to peer server instances and replica server instances on a node in the cluster. When a failure occurs on any of the Tivoli Directory Server instances, the instance is restarted by PowerHA SystemMirror. If failure occurs on a node in the cluster, PowerHA SystemMirror is not supported because fallover and fallback are handled by the Tivoli Directory Server.

## 5.5.1 Planning Smart Assist for Tivoli Directory Server

You must install all Tivoli Directory Server software on all nodes in the cluster before you install Smart Assist for Tivoli Directory Server. You must install the Tivoli Directory Server files in the /opt/IBM/ldap/V6.3 default directory because the Smart Assist looks for the Tivoli Directory Server installation in the default directory during the discovery process.

If you use a stand-alone directory configuration, you must create every database instance on a shared volume group. If you use a peer-to-peer directory configuration or a distributed directory configuration, you do not need to create any database instances on a shared volume group, you can create the database instance on a local node.

## 5.5.2  Software requirements

In our example, we configure a stand-alone directory and then use the Smart Assist to create the needed resource. You must have the following software installed before you install Smart Assist for Tivoli Directory Server:

- Tivoli Directory Server Version 6.3, or later
- PowerHA SystemMirror Version 7.1.1, or later
- Embedded WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.0.7, or later

You must follow the next steps before you configure Smart Assist for Tivoli Directory Server:

1. Check that a shared volume group is available between the nodes. Create a file system by using C-SPOC tools in the volume group to hold the installation of the LDAP instance as shown in Example 5-12.
2. Install the Tivoli Directory Server server filesets on a share file system in the first node . Remember that the same user is created on both nodes, and the home directory for the user is on the share file system on the share volume group.
3. Install embedded WebSphere Application Server for Tivoli Directory Server. It is used to access the server and perform administrative operations later. After you download and unpack embedded WebSphere Application Server, run the installer as shown in Example 5-13.

```
root@smass1 / # clcmd lspv -------------------------------NODE smass1 -------------------------------hdisk0 00f61ab2f915452b rootvg          active hdisk5 00f74d472c0e 5bc0 ldapvg -------------------------------NODE smass2 -------------------------------hdisk0 00f74d47f961b168 rootvg          active hdisk5 00f74d472c0e 5bc0 ldapvg
```

6. Connect to AIX as the owner user of the instance and issue a search to validate that the data is accessible as shown in Example 5-14.
7. Ensure that the service is down, unmount the shared file system, and vary off the shared volume group in the first node.
8. In the second node, use varyonvg to vary on the shared volume group and mount the shared file system. Edit the /etc/services file and include the information from the file in the first node. In our case, Example 5-15 shows the necessary lines that are based on username .
9. Add an entry on the inittab file with the previously created entry in the first node as shown in Example 5-16 on page 250.

```
$ idsldapsearch -D cn=root -w admin -s base objectclass=* | grep config ibm-configurationnamingcontext=CN=CONFIGURATION ibm-slapdisconfigurationmode=FALSE
```

Example 5-14   Validate that the ldap is accessible

```
root@smass1 /tdsdata # cat /etc/services | grep ldapinst DB2_ldapinst 60004/tcp DB2_ldapinst_1 60005/tcp DB2_ldapinst_2 60006/tcp DB2_ldapinst_END 60007/tcp ldapinstsvcids  3708/tcp ldapinstsvcidsi 3737/tcp root@smass1 /tdsdata #
```

Example 5-15   Lines added after you create the LDAP instance

```
root@smass1 / # lsitab -a | grep ids ids0:2345:once:/opt/IBM/ldap/V6.3/sbin/ibmdiradm -I ldapinst > /dev/null 2>&1 #Autostart IBM LDAP Admin Daemon Instance
```

## Migration scenarios

This chapter describes the following topics about migration to IBM PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1:

- Considerations before you migrate to PowerHA 7.1.1
- Migration from pre-7.1 versions:
- -Requirements
- -Stages of migration and the clmigcheck command
- -Offline migration from PowerHA 5.5
- -Snapshot migration from PowerHA 5.5
- -Rolling migration from PowerHA 6.1
- Migration from PowerHA 7.1.0:
- -Offline migration from PowerHA 7.1.0 version
- -Snapshot migration from 7.1.0 version

## 6.1  Considerations before you migrate to PowerHA 7.1.1

IBM introduced a major release of PowerHA SystemMirror in 2010 as version 7.1 of the product. A minor release update, also called a Technology Level (TL), is released as PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1 TL01 or 7.1.1. Before you migrate your existing cluster to PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1, you must be aware of the following considerations:

- The minimum required software versions:
- -AIX 6.1 TL7 Service Pack 3 (SP3) with Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology (RSCT) 3.1.2.0 when you use AIX Version 6.1
- -AIX 7.1 TL1 SP3 with RSCT 3.1.2.0 when you use AIX Version 7.1
- -Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) 2.2.0.1 - FP24 SP01 when the cluster nodes are VIOS client logical partitions (LPARs)

SP3: SP3 of AIX 7.1 TL1 and AIX 6.1 TL7 is the only prerequisite for SP1 of PowerHA 7.1.1. You can install the PowerHA 7.1.1 base at SP2 of AIX 6.1 TL7 or AIX 7.1 TL1.

We strongly advise you to use the latest versions and service packs (SPs) that are available for AIX, VIOS, and PowerHA.

- A shared disk must be dedicated as the cluster repository

Choose an appropriate size. Ensure that the storage subsystem that hosts the repository disk is supported. Also, ensure that the adapters and the multipath driver that are used for the connection to the repository disk are supported. See 3.6.1, 'Repository disk' on page 91 for more details.

If you choose a previously used disk, you must ensure that it is clean.

Previously used disk: The disk must be a clean logical unit number (LUN). It must not contain previous Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) or Logical Volume Manager (LVM) structures that are known to any of our cluster nodes or to a third party.

- Multicast must be enabled in your cluster network infrastructure

Confirm with the network administrator that the multicast IP address that you intend to use is available or ask for an unused one. Ensure that the multicast traffic generated by any of the cluster nodes is correctly forwarded by the network infrastructure toward the other cluster nodes. See 2.5, 'CAA multicast' on page 68 for more details.

- Non-IP heartbeating is accomplished differently in PowerHA 7.1 compared with previous versions.

A non-IP heartbeat channel is automatically configured through the repository disk. More SAN-based heartbeating can be configured through the physical Fibre Channel (FC) or serial-attached SCSI (SAS) adapters. The SAS adapters do not require a special setup. In direct-attached FC adapters, more setup is required. For more details, see 3.7.12, 'Configuring the physical FC adapters for SAN-based heartbeat' on page 101. A similar non-IP SAN-based communication channel can be configured for PowerHA 7.1 LPARs/nodes in N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) or virtual Small Computer System Interface (vSCSI) virtualized environments. The VIOS release must be at least 2.2.0.11-FP24SP01. Setup instructions are available in DOC APAR IV03643:

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IV03643

See 3.7.13, 'Configuring SAN heartbeating in a virtual environment' on page 103 for a configuration example.

You can migrate directly to PowerHA 7.1.1 from PowerHA versions 5.4.1, 5.5, and 6.1 by using one of the following migration methods:

- Offline migration (as explained in 'Offline migration from PowerHA 5.5')
- Snapshot migration (as explained in 'Snapshot migration from PowerHA 5.5')
- Rolling migration (as explained in 'Rolling migration from PowerHA 6.1')

If you run a version that is earlier than PowerHA 5.4.1, you must upgrade to one of the three versions that we mentioned first.

In case you migrate from PowerHA 7.1.0, only the offline or snapshot migration method is available (see 6.3, 'Migration from PowerHA 7.1.0' on page 321).

Important: Rolling migration from PowerHA 7.1.0 to PowerHA 7.1.1 is not supported.

## 6.2  Migration from pre-7.1 versions

Before you begin migration, you must understand the process and all possible scenarios. The process of migration from PowerHA 6.1or prior versions to PowerHA 7.1.1 is similar to the migration process to PowerHA 7.1.0. Both processes differ from the earlier migration processes that are used to upgrade clusters to PowerHA 6.1 or before. The main reason is the introduction of the new Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) feature, initially in AIX 6.1 TL06 and AIX 7.1 TL00, which is used by PowerHA 7.1.

## 6.2.1  Requirements

As in migration to PowerHA 7.1.0, not all configurations can be migrated to PowerHA 7.1.1 from version 6.1 and earlier.

The support for the following outdated network technologies is removed:

- Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
- Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
- Token Ring
- X.25

Cluster networks that are based on these network types must be removed or replaced with Ethernet networks before the migration.

Configurations that use the following features cannot be migrated:

- IP address takeover (IPAT) via Replacement
- Hardware Media Access Control (MAC) Address Takeover
- Heartbeat over IP aliases

These features must be removed from the cluster configuration before you start the migration. You can exchange IPAT via Replacement with IPAT via Aliases. Site concept and IPv6 functionality are not supported in this version.

Non-IP heartbeating is accomplished differently in PowerHA 7.1.1 so the previously used non-IP networks are not supported anymore:

- RS232
- HACMP Target Mode SCSI heartbeat (TMSCSI)
- Target Mode Serial Storage Architecture (TMSSA)

- Disk Heartbeat (DISKHB)
- Multinode disk heartbeat (MNDHB)

Although possible, you do not need to remove the non-IP networks from the configuration before the migration. The migration process warns you and removes any identified non-IP network.

The 'Communication Path to a Node' parameter for each PowerHA cluster node must match the host name of that node. If they do not match, you have to reconfigure the cluster so that they match. The definition for the host name of a node is the output of the command hostname when run on that node.

The cluster node host name that resolves to a persistent IP address is not supported. The host name of the cluster nodes must resolve to a base IP . While you plan for migration from PowerHA 6.1or earlier to PowerHA 7.1.1, if a cluster node host name resolves to a persistent IP address, reconfigure the cluster so that the host name resolves to a base IP . For more details, see 3.7.5, 'Setting up the hostname' on page 96.

Any standard shared volume group must be converted to Enhanced Concurrent Mode before you start the migration.

## 6.2.2  Stages of migration and the clmigcheck command

Migration to PowerHA 7.1.1 from PowerHA 5.4.1, 5.5, or 6.1involves the following stages:

1. Upgrade to AIX 6.1 TL07 or AIX 7.1 TL01.
2. Before you can migrate PowerHA to version 7.1.1, you must upgrade the AIX operating system. You can upgrade all nodes to the appropriate AIX level first before you upgrade the PowerHA filesets on any node. You can either use a rolling migration approach, while you keep the cluster up on at least one node, or a total cluster outage. Only for the rolling migration, you can upgrade both the AIX operating system and the PowerHA filesets in the same step on a node before you go to the next node.
2. Perform the premigration check ( clmigcheck ).

During this stage, you use the clmigcheck command to check whether the current PowerHA cluster configuration can be migrated to PowerHA 7.1.1:

- -Run the clmigcheck command on the first node to validate the current cluster configuration for migration. If the configuration is invalid, the clmigcheck program notifies you of any unsupported elements, such as disk heartbeating or IPAT via Replacement. If the configuration is supported, continue by choosing option 3 to specify the repository disk and the IP multicast address.
- -The clmigcheck command is executed on each remaining node in the cluster during the migration process. However, the menu options do not appear. You get a message that states ' OK to install the new version of PowerHA SystemMirror . '

The clmigcheck command: The clmigcheck command is not a PowerHA command. It is part of bos.cluster and is in the /usr/sbin directory. When it is run on the last node of the PowerHA cluster, the clmigcheck automatically creates a CAA cluster.

3. Upgrade to PowerHA 7.1.1.

After stage 2 is complete, you can upgrade the PowerHA filesets to version 7.1.1. In offline and snapshot migration procedures, you must upgrade them on all nodes before you start PowerHA cluster services on any node. With the rolling migration, you can perform all three stages on a node before you go to the next node.

## 6.2.3 Offline migration from PowerHA 5.5

This migration process involves bringing the PowerHA cluster down, installing PowerHA 7.1.1, and restarting PowerHA cluster services one node at a time.

Before you migrate PowerHA, AIX needs to be upgraded or migrated on all cluster nodes. All cluster nodes must have one shared disk that is used for the cluster repository. Ensure that the current network setup is multicast enabled.

PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1 and higher supports only Enhanced Concurrent Mode volume groups. Therefore, bos.clvm.enh is a prerequisite to convert non-concurrent volume groups that are used in previous PowerHA versions.

We describe the steps of an offline migration example from PowerHA 5.5 to PowerHA 7.1.1 for a 2-node cluster.

## Test environment

The nodes are VIOS client LPARs on different frames that share the SAN LUNs through NPIV. The backing devices are LUNs on a DS4800 storage subsystem.

The environment begins with AIX 6.1.5.7 and PowerHA 5.5.0.10. The migration leads to AIX 6.1.7.3 and PowerHA 7.1.1.0.

## Starting configuration

Figure 6-1 on page 260 shows a simplified layout of a cluster that is migrated in this scenario. Both the systems run AIX 6.1 TL5 SP7. The installed PowerHA is version 5.5 SP10.

The cluster layout is a hot-standby configuration. The sydney system is the primary server for the DB2 application. The perth system is the takeover or standby node.

Because of resource limitations, the disk heartbeat uses one of the existing shared disks. Three networks are defined:

- The net\_ether\_01 network is used by the application and its users.
- The net\_diskhb\_01 network is the disk heartbeating network.
- The net\_ether\_02 network is an IPAT via Replacement network.

Figure 6-1 Initial cluster configuration

<!-- image -->

Figure 6.1 shows the cluster configuration before the migration begins. The cluster contains two resource groups: db2rg and testrg . The db2rg resource group hosts the DB2 database application and uses IP Aliasing for IP Address takeover for its service address. The testrg hosts a dummy test script application and uses IPAT via Replacement for the service IP/label. The home node for db2rg is sydney . The perth node is home for testrg . Figure 6-2 on page 261 shows the AIX and cluster level and the resource group states that are migrated in this scenario.

## Planning the offline migration

Offline migration is best when you have a maintenance window.

Your migration planning must begin with a careful analysis of the cluster to avoid starting a migration from an unsupported configuration. After the unsupported elements are identified, downtime must be scheduled to convert the configuration to a supported one.

The clmigcheck command can assist you with this analysis, but this command needs the AIX operating system to be upgraded, at least on one node. A possible approach is to first upgrade the AIX operating system on all nodes, one node at a time. Keep the cluster running on the other nodes, or upgrade AIX on all nodes by having a cluster downtime.

An additional shared disk is required for the new CAA repository disk. Figure 6-4 shows the results of the completed migration. To migrate, see 'Migrating the nodes' on page 266.

After migration, the cluster configuration looks like Figure 6-4.

Figure 6-4   Cluster configuration after migration

<!-- image -->

Figure 6-5 on page 263 shows the AIX and PowerHA levels after migration is completed. It also shows resource group states.

Figure 6-5   Two-node cluster configuration after migration

<!-- image -->

The cluster configuration, after migration, does not have a disk-based heartbeat network and it does not have an IPAT via Replacement type of network ( net\_ether\_02 ) either. The cllsif output that is shown in Figure 6-6 shows the migrated configuration.

Figure 6-6   cllsif output after cluster migration completes

<!-- image -->

A new volume group, caavg\_private , is created when the CAA cluster is configured.

Figure 6-7 on page 264 and Figure 6-8 on page 264 show an example of using the clmigcheck command to identify unsupported elements in the configuration, in this case, IPAT via Replacement and disk heartbeat network.

```

The PowerHA network name is net_ether_02. This will have to be removed from the configuration before migration to PowerHA System Mirror
```

Figure 6-8   clmigcheck error for IPAT via Replacement

Any set of actions that involves modifications at the operating system level or cluster level must be preceded by a back-out/reversion plan that includes the following operations:

- Back up all data and binaries of all applications.
- Take a cluster snapshot and save it locally and to another machine.
- Save a copy of any custom script files locally and to another machine.
- Perform a mksysb backup of each involved node.

A back-out plan allows easy restoration of the application data and binaries, cluster, and AIX configuration in case you run into problems.

## Preparing the offline migration

After you finish the analysis, take the following steps:

- Ensure that all nodes are at the same level of the operating system and cluster software (including PTFs).
- Check that the cluster software is committed (and not merely applied) by using lslpp command.
- Ensure that the software is consistent on all nodes by using the lppchk command.

Before you start the actual migration, check that the cluster has no pending changes on any of its nodes since the last cluster startup and also check that the cluster is in a stable state:

1. Run Verification and Synchronization (Figure 6-9 on page 265) on each cluster node by following the path smitty hacmp  Extended Configuration Extended Verification and Synchronization . Select Yes for the 'Verify changes only?' field and press Enter.

```
HACMP Verification and Synchronization (Active Cluster Nodes Exist) Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes.

```

Figure 6-10   No change detected during verification

Any other message from cldare means that changes are pending for the cluster or that errors are detected. You must perform more examination and finally ensure that the cluster is in the required configuration with no errors or pending changes.

3. Ensure that you start from a stable state of the cluster (Example 6-1 on page 266).

```

## Migrating the nodes

To migrate the cluster, follow the steps:

1. Stop the cluster services on all nodes as shown in Figure 6-11.

Use the Bring Resource Groups Offline option in the smitty clstop panel.

```

```

Figure 6-11 Stop cluster services on all nodes with Bring Resource Groups Offline

Check that the cluster services are stopped on all nodes and that resource groups are offline as shown in Example 6-2.

## Example 6-2 Checking the cluster state

```
root@sydney/ # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES | grep state Current state: ST_INIT root@sydney / # clRGinfo Cluster IPC error: The cluster manager on node clmgr1 is in ST_INIT or NOT_CONFIGURED state and cannot process the IPC request. root@sydney / # root@perth / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES | grep state Current state: ST_INIT root@perth / #
```

2. Upgrade AIX on all nodes to version 6.1 TL7 SP2 (or later).

Use any supported procedure to upgrade the operating system. See the AIX installation guide for the procedure. Then, install the following filesets if they are not already installed:

- -bos.cluster and bos.ahafs are mandatory CAA required filesets.
- -devices.common.IBM.storfwork.rte
- -bos.clvm.enh is mandatory for PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.x.

Mandatory filesets : You must install the CAA specific bos.cluster , bos.ahafs , and all other mandatory filesets.

Ensure that you restart the node and check the operating system level as shown in Example 6-3.

```

```

Example 6-3 Checking operating system level and AIX cluster fileset level

3. Install clic.rte 4.7.0.0 after the AIX upgrade.
4. Decide on the shared disk to use as the cluster repository disk. If a previously defined volume group is on any disk, you must remove it. For more information, see Chapter 2, 'Cluster Aware AIX' on page 35.

Previous volume disk group : The disk must be a clean LUN that does not contain a previous volume group that is known to any of our cluster nodes or to a third party. The volume group information must be removed from any of the cluster nodes, too.

5. Enable CAA logging. Edit the /etc/syslog.conf file on all migrated nodes to add an entry such as ' *.info /tmp/syslog.out rotate size 10m files 10 '. Verify that the specified file exists; otherwise, create it. Then, restart or refresh the syslogd daemon (Example 6-4).

```

Example 6-4   Updating the syslog.conf file to capture CAA events

Run the /usr/sbin/clmigcheck command on the first node to check for any unsupported element. You see the initial panel as shown in Figure 6-12.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------Please select one of the following options: 1       = Check ODM configuration. 2       = Check snapshot configuration. 3       = Enter repository disk and multicast IP addresses. Select one of the above,"x"to exit or "h" for help:
```

Figure 6-12   clmigcheck panel

Follow these steps:

- a. Select option 1 (Check ODM configuration).

When you choose this option, the clmigcheck command checks your cluster configuration and reports any unsupported element that might affect the migration.

This migration scenario uses a disk-based heartbeat path between two nodes and the IPAT via Replacement type of network. If you have more than one disk-based heartbeat network, it is reported, as well.

The clmigcheck command detects these situations and warns you that this configuration cannot be migrated as shown in Figure 6-13 and Figure 6-14.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------CONFIG-WARNING: The configuration contains unsupported hardware:  Disk Heartbeat network.  The PowerHA network name is net_diskhb_01.  This will be removed from the configuration during the migration to PowerHA System Mirror 7.1. Hit <Enter> to continue
```

Figure 6-13   clmigcheck warning for disk heartbeat network

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------CONFIG-ERROR: The configuration contains unsupported options:  IP Address Takeover via Replacement.  The PowerHA network name is net_ether_02. This will have to be removed from the configuration before migration to PowerHA System Mirror
```

- b. Remove the IPAT via Replacement type of network from the configuration. Use smitty hacmp . Select Extended Configuration  Extended Topology Configuration  Configure HACMP Networks  Remove a Network from HACMP Cluster to remove the unsupported networks. Select the IPAT via Replacement network, net\_ether\_02 , in this example as shown in Figure 6-15 on page 270.

- c. Verify and synchronize the cluster. Start smitty hacmp . Select Extended Configuration  Extended Verification and Synchronization .
- d. Run clmigcheck again and select option 3 to enter the repository disk as shown in Figure 6-17 on page 271.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------Select the disk to use for the repository 1       = 00f74d4733c9370e(hdisk3) Select one of the above or "x" to exit:1
```

- e. Enter the multicast IP address to be used for network monitoring as shown in Figure 6-18.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------PowerHA System Mirror uses multicast address for internal cluster communication and monitoring. These must be in the multicast range, 224.0.0.0 239.255.255.255. If you make a NULL entry, AIX will generate an appropriate address for you. You should only specify an address if you have an explicit reason to do so, but are cautioned that this address cannot be changed once the configuration is activated (i.e. migration is complete). h = help Enter the multicast IP address to use for network monitoring: 228.1.1.36
```

Figure 6-18 clmigcheck panel to enter multicast IP address

The repository disk and the multicast IP address are saved in the /var/clmigcheck/clmigcheck.txt file on each node of the cluster.

## f. Exit the clmigcheck tool.

6. Upgrade PowerHA on the sydney node to the PowerHA 7.1.1 base release.

Perform an update\_all installation by using the base PowerHA 7.1.1 filesets. Do not apply any full service pack or individual fix on top of the base filesets until all nodes in the cluster are upgraded to the new base release. The only exception is the application of interim fixes that are supplied specifically for the base filesets, which is allowed. Example 6-5 shows the PowerHA filesets that are updated to the base 7.1.1 release.

```

We upgraded the operating system to AIX 6.1 TL7 SP3 earlier and restarted the system. A restart is not required. The update process converts the existing cluster configuration to be compatible with the new software. Conversion details are logged in the /tmp/clconvert.log file.

7. Populate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file on sydney with hostname IP addresses as shown in Example 6-6.

You must include the addresses that resolve to the host name of the cluster nodes.

```
root@sydney / # cat /etc/cluster/rhosts 10.1.1.54 10.1.1.55 root@sydney / # host  `hostname`
```

Example 6-6   Updating /etc/cluster/rhosts file

sydney is 10.1.1.54

root@sydney

/ #

As you populate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file, you must refresh the clcomd subsystem as shown in Example 6-7.

Example 6-7   Refreshing clcomd

root@sydney / # lssrc -s clcomd clcomd           caa              14024890     active

Subsystem         Group            PID          Status root@sydney / # refresh -s clcomd

root@sydney / #

8. Populate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file in the perth node with the hostname IP addresses.

You must include the addresses that resolve to the host name of the cluster nodes as shown in Example 6-8.

```
root@perth / # cat /etc/cluster/rhosts 10.1.1.54 10.1.1.55 root@perth / # host  `hostname` perth is 10.1.1.55 root@perth / #
```

Example 6-8   Updating /etc/cluster/rhosts on the last node

After you populate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file, you must refresh the clcomd subsystem as shown in Example 6-9.

```
root@perth / # lssrc -s clcomd Subsystem         Group            PID          Status clcomd           caa              15401162     active root@perth / # refresh -s clcomd root@perth / #
```

Example 6-9   Refreshing clcomd on the last node

9. Run the clmigcheck tool on the last node of the cluster as shown in Example 6-10.

```

## 11.Upgrade PowerHA on the perth node to the PowerHA 7.1.1 base release.

Perform an update\_all installation by using the base PowerHA 7.1.1 filesets. Do not apply any full service pack or individual fix on top of the base filesets until all nodes in the cluster are upgraded to the new base release. The only exception is the application of interim fixes that are supplied specifically for the base filesets, which is allowed. Example 6-12 shows the PowerHA filesets that are updated to the base 7.1.1 release.

Figure 6-19 Warning message about mixed level cluster

Run lssrc -ls clstrmgrES or odmget HACMPcluster on the node to check the cluster version as shown in Example 6-13.

```
root@sydney / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES | grep version CLversion: 13 root@sydney / # odmget HACMPcluster | grep -e "cluster_version" cluster_version = 13 root@sydney / #
```

Example 6-13 Checking cluster version on the first node

- 13.After the node sydney successfully joins the cluster, start cluster services on the second node of the cluster ( perth ).

You can use smit clstart to start the cluster services. When the cluster services start on this node, the warning message about a mixed level cluster disappears.

You can run lssrc -ls clstrmgrES or odmget HACMPcluster on the node to check the cluster version as shown in Example 6-14.

```
root@perth / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES | grep version root@perth / # odmget HACMPcluster | grep -e "cluster_version"
```

Example 6-14   Checking cluster version on the second node

```
CLversion: 13 cluster_version = 13 root@perth / #
```

Check that the cluster is stable and that the resource groups are online as expected (per the participating node list and startup policy). See Example 6-15.

## 6.2.4  Snapshot migration from PowerHA 5.5

We use the cluster snapshot to migrate from PowerHA 5.5 to PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. In this migration, we need to stop the cluster services on all nodes gracefully, uninstall PowerHA 5.5, and install PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. There is a minimum downtime window during the migration. Plan this downtime before you migrate the cluster. We use the clmigcheck utility to check whether the cluster snapshot complies with PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. We need to remove all unsupported elements in the configuration before we migrate to PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1.

## Cluster configuration

The test environment is a 2-node cluster with two Ethernet networks, one disk heartbeat network, and one resource group as shown in Figure 6-20 on page 279.

Figure 6-20   Cluster diagram

<!-- image -->

The Ethernet network net\_ether\_01 is used by the application server and IP address takeover via aliasing. The resource group contains the user application server, volume group, and service IP . The user application server script writes the date entry into the file that is hosted by the volume group tst\_vg1 every 3 seconds. It has start and stop scripts. We show the various scripts that are used in this test environment. The application server script is shown in Example 6-16.

Example 6-16   Application server script that writes date entry into the file every 3 seconds

```
#!/bin/ksh #  this is just an application we use to see if the vg, lv, fs and application #  continue running after a takeover # set -x outfile=/ha_testfs/test.out rm $outfile count=0 # check if the filesystem is mounted while [[ -z $flag ]] do mounted=`/usr/sbin/mount | grep ha_testfs` if [[ -n $mounted ]] then flag=true fi
```

let count=count+3

if [ $count -gt 360 ]

```
then flag=false fi done if [[ $flag = true ]] then #loop to write to the new output file while (true); do echo `date` >> $outfile sleep 3 done else exit 1 fi exit 0 The script that is used to start the user application server is shown in Example 6-17. Example 6-17   Startup script to start application server #!/bin/ksh count=0 while [[ -z $flag ]] do tmp=`/usr/sbin/lsvg -o | /bin/grep tst_vg1` if [[ -n $tmp ]] then flag=true fi let count=count+3 if [ $count -gt 360 ] then flag=false fi done # if [[ $flag = true ]] then /scripts/appscript else exit 1 fi # exit 0 The script that is used to stop the user application server is shown in Example 6-18. Example 6-18   Stop script to stop application server #!/bin/ksh # set -x PIDS=`ps -ef | grep /scripts/appscript | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'`
```

```
#
```

```
echo $PIDS is the pid for appscript if [ -n $PIDS ] then for pid in $PIDS do /usr/bin/kill -TERM $pid done fi
```

The script that is used to monitor the user application is shown in Example 6-19.

```
#!/bin/ksh proc=`ps -ef | grep /scripts/appscript | grep -v grep`
```

Example 6-19   Script that is used to monitor the user application server

```
rc=$? if [[ $rc != 0 ]]; then return 1 fi return 0
```

## Taking the system image backup

Take the system backup by using the mksysb command before you start the migration so that you can restore the previous system image if the migration fails. For information about taking system backups by using the mksysb command, see 'AIX 6.1 Installation and migration' at this website:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v6r1/topic/com.ibm.aix.install/doc/in sgdrf/insgdrf\_pdf.pdf

Migration consists of various steps. We go through these steps in detail.

## Updating the AIX level

PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 requires AIX 6.1 with TL 7 (6100-07) plus SP02 or higher version of the bos.cluster.rte (6.1.7.2) or AIX 7.1 with TL 1 (7100-01) plus the SP02 or higher version of bos.cluster.rte (7.1.1.2) and RSCT 3.1.2.0. Update AIX on all nodes in the cluster to AIX 6.1 TL 7 or AIX 71. TL 1. Then, install the following filesets if they are not already installed:

- bos.cluster
- bos.clvm.enh
- bos.ahafs
- bos.data

Required: bos.cluster , bos.ahafs , and bos.clvm.enh are mandatory filesets for PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1.

Restart the nodes after you update the AIX level. Check that all required filesets are installed. Ensure that the filesets installed cleanly as shown in Example 6-20.

Example 6-20   Mandatory filesets for SystemMirror 7.1.1

```
[c665f1sq07][/]> lppchk -v [c665f1sq07][/]> lslpp -L bos.cluster\* bos.clvm.enh bos.data bos.ahafs Fileset                      Level  State  Type  Description (Uninstaller)
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

| bos.data          | 6.1.6.15  | C   | F   | Base Operating System Data                 |

## Creating a snapshot

Create a cluster snapshot by using the smit command. Save the snapshot in the /tmp/migration folder. Start smit hacmp . Select Extended Configuration  Snapshot Configuration  Create a Snapshot of the Cluster Configuration . Enter the cluster snapshot name and description as shown in Figure 6-21, and press Enter.

Figure 6-21   Smit panel to create the cluster snapshot

<!-- image -->

The command creates a snapshot under the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/snapshots/ directory as shown in Figure 6-22 on page 283. It creates two files: migration\_cluster.odm and migration\_cluster.info . If the cluster services are running, stop the cluster services gracefully.

Figure 6-22   Shows snapshot that is created successfully

<!-- image -->

## Checking snapshot compliance

There are a few limitations in the snapshot migration. Not all cluster configurations are compliant for migration. First, we need to remove the unsupported elements from the cluster configuration before we migrate. The following configuration items are not supported:

- Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), and token ring interfaces
- Two-node or multinode disk heartbeat network
- Two sites
- Extended distance (XD) configuration
- IPv6
- IPAT via IP Replacement
- Enhanced security mode
- Heartbeat via aliasing

## The clmigcheck utility

We use the clmigcheck utility to check whether the cluster snapshot is compliant with PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. This utility is at /usr/sbin . Y ou can check the path by using the which command as shown in Figure 6-23 on page 284.

```
[c665f1sq09][/]> which clmigcheck /usr/sbin/clmigcheck
```

Figure 6-23   clmigcheck path

Run the clmigcheck command, which prompts for user input as shown in Figure 6-24.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------Please select one of the following options: 1 = Check ODM configuration. 2 = Check snapshot configuration. 3 = Enter repository disk and multicast IP addresses. Select one of the above,"x"to exit or "h" for help:
```

Figure 6-24   clmigcheck command prompt

With the clmigcheck command, you can perform these functions:

1. Check the ODM configuration.
2. It checks whether the Object Data Manager (ODM) entries are compliant with PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. This option is used in other migration methods. We are not using this option in the snapshot migration.
2. Check the snapshot configuration.

It checks whether the snapshot is compliant with PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1.

3. Enter repository disk and multicast IP addresses.

PowerHA SystemMirror supports CAA, which needs a shared repository disk to store cluster configuration. We need to specify the shared repository disk details in this step. For more information about the repository disk, see 3.6.1, 'Repository disk' on page 91.

Run the snapshot configuration check. The clmigcheck command asks for the snapshot name. Enter the snapshot name that you created earlier. It processes the snapshot. If your configuration has unsupported elements, it displays configuration errors or warnings as shown in Figure 6-25 on page 285.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------h = help Enter snapshot name (in /usr/es/sbin/cluster/snapshots): migration_cluster clsnapshot: Removing any existing temporary HACMP ODM entries... clsnapshot: Creating temporary HACMP ODM object classes... clsnapshot: Adding HACMP ODM entries to a temporary directory... clsnapshot: Succeeded generating temporary ODM containing Cluster Snapshot: migration_cluster ------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------CONFIG-WARNING: The configuration contains unsupported hardware:  Disk Heartbeat network.  The PowerHA network name is net_diskhb_01.  This will be removed from the configuration during the migration to PowerHA System Mirror 7.1. Hit <Enter> to continue
```

Figure 6-25   Shows that ODM has unsupported elements

Check the /tmp/clmigcheck/clmigcheck.log file for errors or warnings. If the cluster contains any unsupported elements, remove all unsupported elements from the cluster configuration. Take a fresh snapshot and run the clmigcheck command again until the ODM has no unsupported elements as shown in Figure 6-26.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------The ODM has no unsupported elements. Hit <Enter> to continue
```

Figure 6-26 Shows that ODM has no unsupported elements

After you check the snapshot compliance, provide the repository disk and the multicast address details. Select option 3 from the PowerHA SystemMirror Migration Check window. Choose the appropriate shared repository disk as shown in Figure 6-27 on page 286.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------Please select one of the following options: 1 = Check ODM configuration. 2 = Check snapshot configuration. 3 = Enter reopsitory disk and multicast IP addresses. Select one of the above,"x"to exit or "h" for help: 3 Verifying clcomd communication, please be patient. ------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------Select the disk to use for the repository 1       = 00f74d4733c9370e(hdisk3) Select one of the above or "x" to exit:  1
```

Figure 6-27   Repository disk details

After you select the repository disk, the clmigcheck utility asks the user to provide the multicast address. Enter the multicast address, if you reserved one for your cluster communication in your company network. Otherwise, enter a NULL value as shown in Example 6-21. The CAA creates the multicast address for you based on the base IP address. For more information about the multicast address, see 3.5.11, 'Multicast heartbeat' on page 89.

```
Example 6-21   Multicast address panel ------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------PowerHA System Mirror uses multicast address for internal cluster communication and monitoring. These must be in the multicast range, 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255. If you make a NULL entry, AIX will generate an appropriate address for you. You should only specify an address if you have an explicit reason to do so, but are cautioned that this address cannot be changed once the configuration is activated (i.e. migration is complete). h = help Enter the multicast IP address to use for network monitoring: NULL
```

The clmigcheck utility collects data from the user and creates the /var/clmigcheck/clmigcheck.txt on all nodes in the cluster.

## Uninstalling PowerHA 5.5

Uninstall existing PowerHA 5.5 filesets from all cluster nodes by using the installp command as shown in Example 6-22.

Example 6-22   Uninstalling PowerHA 5.5 filesets

```

```

Check that you uninstalled all PowerHA 5.5 filesets cleanly with the commands that are shown in Figure 6-28 on page 288.

```
root@clmgr1 / # lslpp -l | grep cluster.* root@clmgr1 / # root@clmgr1 / # installp -C 0503-439 installp:  No filesets were found in the Software Vital Product Database that could be cleaned up.
```

Figure 6-28   Shows a clean uninstall

## /etc/syslog.conf and /etc/cluster/rhosts files

We need to edit the /etc/syslog.conf and the /etc/cluster/rhosts files before we install PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1.

PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 and later use the /etc/cluster/rhosts file for communication. This file is not populated automatically. We must edit it manually and refresh the clcomd daemon. In this file, each line contains only cluster nodes IPs. For more information, see 3.8.1, 'Propagating the /etc/cluster/rhosts file' on page 113.

We need to edit the /etc/syslog.conf file to enable the capture of the CAA log information. After we add the entry in the syslog.conf file, we refresh the syslogd daemon as shown in Example 6-23.

```
caa.info /var/adm/ras/syslog.caa rotate size 1m files 10 *.info /tmp/syslog.out rotate size 10m files 10
```

Example 6-23   Editing /etc/syslog.conf file

## PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 installation

Now, install the PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 filesets on all cluster nodes. The PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 filesets are on the installation media. See 3.7.15, 'Installing PowerHA filesets' on page 111.

## Converting a verified snapshot to PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1

We created the snapshot by using PowerHA 5.5. We need to convert it to PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1. We use the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/conversion/clconvert\_snapshot command to convert the snapshot to the PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 version. We need to pass the version number from which we are migrating and the snapshot name as shown in Example 6-24.

Example 6-24 Converting cluster snapshot from 5.5 to 7.1.1

```
root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/conversion/clconvert_snapshot -v 5.5 -s migration_cluster Extracting ODM's from snapshot file... done. Converting extracted ODM's... done. Rebuilding snapshot file... done. root@clmgr1 / #
```

Command usage : The command uses this syntax:

/usr/es/sbin/cluster/conversion/clconvert\_snapshot -v [release] [-s [snap\_file]]

Include these options:

- -v [ version ] version from which we migrated
- -s [ snap\_file ] snapshot file

Warning : If you do not know your previous version, do not run this command.

## Restoring the cluster

We restore the cluster configuration from the converted snapshot:

1. We use the smit path to restore the cluster configuration. Start smit hacmp . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage Cluster  Snapshot Configuration  Restore the Cluster Configuration From a Snapshot .

Select the snapshot name that we converted earlier as shown in Example 6-25 and press Enter.

## 6.2.5 Rolling migration from PowerHA 6.1

During a rolling migration, you perform a series of operations on each node, one node at a time. Therefore, for a node, you first stop cluster services with the takeover or with the move resource groups option. Then, you upgrade the operating system and the cluster software. Then, you reintegrate the node into the cluster, which brings its resource groups back in the initial status.

Rolling migration helps you when the main goal is minimum application downtime. You experience a short application interruption when the resource group is moved to a peer node. Also, a second short interruption is experienced when the resource group moves back to the home node after this node is migrated.

Rolling migration is allowed only to the base version of PowerHA 7.1.1. After the whole cluster is upgraded to the base version of PowerHA 7.1.1, the latest Service Pack can be applied on each node without closing the applications. During the update to the latest Service Pack, the applications and resources continue to run on the node, although they are not highly available during the update. For more details, see 4.2, 'AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror service pack upgrade' on page 150. You can also apply the Service Pack in a rolling approach, one node at a time. We describe the steps of a rolling migration example from PowerHA 6.1 to PowerHA 7.1.1 for a 3-node cluster.

## Test environment

The nodes are VIOS client LPARs on different frames that share SAN LUNs through NPIV. The backing devices are LUNs that are carved in a DS4800 storage subsystem. The net\_ether\_01 is a single adapter logical network and the application is available on the migrsvc2 service IP label. Each node has two virtual Ethernet adapters in network net\_ether\_02 , all are in the same VLAN, which is distinct from the VLAN of net\_ether\_01 . Example 6-29 shows the cluster topology.

The cluster contains two resource groups: ihs\_rg and tstipat\_rg . The ihs\_rg resource group hosts an IBM HTTP Server application. The tstipat\_rg resource group hosts a dummy test script application. Both resource groups use IPAT via Aliases for the service IP . The home node for ihs\_rg is node migr3 . The migr4 node is the home node for tstipat\_rg . The migr5 node is in a standby role. As shown in Figure 6-31, the Startup Policy and Fallback Policy attributes of the ihs\_rg resource group are intentionally changed from their defaults to 'Online On First Available Node' and 'Never Fallback'.

Figure 6-31   Resource group attributes

## Planning the rolling migration

Begin the migration planning by reviewing 6.1, 'Considerations before you migrate to PowerHA 7.1.1' on page 256. Then, continue with a careful analysis of the cluster to avoid starting a migration from an unsupported configuration. For more details, see 6.2.1, 'Requirements' on page 257. Downtime must be scheduled to convert this configuration to a supported one.

Any set of actions that involves modifications at the operating system or cluster level must be preceded by back-out (reversion) planning that includes the following operations:

- Back up all data and binaries of the applications.
- Take a cluster snapshot and save it locally and also to another machine.
- Save a copy of any custom script files locally and also to another machine.
- Perform a mksysb backup of each involved node.

A back-out plan allows easy restoration of the application data, binaries, cluster, and AIX configuration if you encounter problems. We assume that you start a rolling migration and you get CONFIG-ERROR messages while you run the clmigcheck command on the first node. See For an example of this message, see Figure 6-33 on page 297.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------CONFIG-ERROR: The configuration contains unsupported options:  IP Address Takeover via Replacement.  The PowerHA network name is net_ether_02. This will have to be removed from the configuration before migration to PowerHA System Mirror
```

Figure 6-33   clmigcheck error for IPAT via Replacement

Then, you have two choices. If the downtime is acceptable, try to reconfigure the cluster to eliminate the errors and then continue the rolling migration. Otherwise, execute the back-out plan and then reevaluate the entire migration planning and analysis by considering the errors that you encountered.

## Preparing the rolling migration

After you finish the analysis, take the following steps:

- Ensure that all nodes are at the same level of the operating system and cluster software. Check that the cluster software is committed (and not merely applied). Use the oslevel -s and lslpp -L cluster\* commands. Verify that the software is consistent on all nodes by using the lppchk -v command.
- Decide on the shared disk to be used as a cluster repository and coordinate with the network administrator on the multicast communication as described in 'Considerations before you migrate to PowerHA 7.1.1' on page 256.

Before you start the actual migration, ensure that the cluster has no pending changes on any of its nodes or configuration errors since the last cluster startup. Also, check that all nodes joined the cluster and are in a stable state. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the cluster has no pending changes on any of its nodes.

Run odmget HACMPcluster | grep handle on all nodes (Example 6-31).

```
root@migr3 / # odmget HACMPcluster | grep handle handle = 1 root@migr3 / # root@migr4 / #odmget HACMPcluster | grep handle handle = 2 root@migr4 / # root@migr5 / #odmget HACMPcluster | grep handle handle = 3 root@migr5 / #
```

Example 6-31   Checking pending changes on cluster nodes

A non-zero value for the handle parameter on each node means that there are no pending changes so you can go to the next step. A zero value for the handle parameter on a node means that changes are pending on that node.

If changes are pending on one node and you choose to apply them on top of the current configuration, check them, decide on a final configuration, and run a Verification and Synchronization operation. In an active cluster, certain changes might not be allowed. If you really need these changes, you must stop the cluster services.

If you decide to cancel any pending changes on any node and to keep the currently active configuration, run on either node smit hacmp and select Problem Determination Tools  Restore HACMP Configuration Database from Active Configuration . Select the Verification and Synchronization operation on the same node.

This way, you get a clean and homogeneous configuration on all nodes. Any pending changes on other nodes are canceled by the final successful synchronization.

2. Check that the cluster has no configuration errors.

Run the Verify Cluster Configuration operation on either cluster node by following the path smitty hacmp  Problem Determination Tools  HACMP Verification  Verify HACMP Configuration . Use No for the 'Verify changes only?' field and press Enter. The expected results are shown in Figure 6-34.

3. Check that all nodes joined the cluster and are in a stable state (Example 6-32).

```

```

Example 6-32   Checking that the cluster is stable

root@migr4 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep -e state -e version -e vrmf -e fix Current state: ST\_STABLE CLversion: 11

local node vrmf is 6107

```
cluster fix level is "7" root@migr4 / #
```

```
root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep -e state -e version -e vrmf -e fix Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 11 local node vrmf is 6107 cluster fix level is "7" root@migr5 / #
```

## Migrating the first node

To migrate the first node, follow these steps:

1. Stop the cluster services on the first node ( migr3 in our scenario) .

Use the Move Resource Groups option in the Stop Cluster Services ( smitty clstop ) panel (Figure 6-35).

Stop Cluster Services

Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes.

[Entry Fields]

* Stop now, on system restart or both                 now + Stop Cluster Services on these nodes               [migr3] + BROADCAST cluster shutdown?                         false +

Check that the cluster services are successfully stopped on the first node (Example 6-34). Look for the ST\_INIT status.

```
root@migr3 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep state Current state: ST_INIT root@migr3 / #
```

Example 6-34   Cluster services are stopped on the first node

2. Upgrade AIX on the first node to version 7.1 TL1 SP2 or later.

Use a supported procedure to upgrade the operating system. Then, install the following filesets if they are not already installed:

- -bos.cluster and bos.ahafs
- -bos.clvm.enh

Mandatory filesets: You must install the CAA-specific bos.cluster and bos.ahafs . Another mandatory fileset is bos.clvm.enh . Even though it is not a prerequisite for the PowerHA 7.1. installation, this fileset is needed for Enhanced Concurrent Mode volume groups, which is the only supported mode in PowerHA 7.1.

Ensure that you reboot the node and make the final checks (Example 6-35).

3. Populate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file with all cluster IP addresses. Y ou must include the addresses that resolve to the host name of the cluster nodes (Example 6-36).

```
root@migr3 / # cat /etc/cluster/rhosts 10.1.1.32 10.1.1.40 10.1.1.72 10.1.2.32 10.1.2.40 10.1.2.72 10.1.3.32 10.1.3.40 10.1.3.72 172.16.21.32 172.16.21.40
```

Example 6-36 Adding all cluster IPs in /etc/cluster/rhosts

```
172.16.21.75
```

```
172.16.21.68 10.10.20.68 root@migr3 / # root@migr3 / # host `hostname` migr3 is 10.1.1.32 root@migr3 / # root@migr4 / # host `hostname` migr4 is 10.1.1.40 root@migr4 / # root@migr5 / # host `hostname` migr5 is 10.1.1.72 root@migr5 / #
```

After you change /etc/cluster/rhosts , you must refresh clcomd (Example 6-37).

Example 6-37   Refreshing clcomd

```
root@migr3 / # refresh -s clcomd 0513-095 The request for subsystem refresh was completed successfully. root@migr3 / #
```

4. Run the clmigcheck command on the first node.

You see the initial PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ( clmigcheck ) panel as shown in Figure 6-36.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------Please select one of the following options: 1       = Check ODM configuration. 2       = Check snapshot configuration. 3       = Enter reopsitory disk and multicast IP addresses. Select one of the above,"x"to exit or "h" for help:
```

Figure 6-36   clmigcheck initial panel

Follow these steps:

- a. On Figure 6-36, select option 1 (Check ODM configuration).

When you choose this option, the clmigcheck command checks your configuration and reports any problems that might affect the migration. Our migration scenario uses three different point-to-point disk-based heartbeat paths, one for each pair of nodes.

The clmigcheck command detects a situation and warns you that this configuration is removed during migration (Figure 6-37 on page 302).

Figure 6-37   clmigcheck heartbeat disk warning

<!-- image -->

You do not need to act because the disk-based heartbeating is automatically removed during migration.

If CONFIG-ERROR messages are displayed and if the downtime is acceptable, try to reconfigure the cluster to eliminate the error. Then, repeat the clmigcheck verification. Otherwise, execute the back-out plan and redo the entire analysis and consider the encountered error.

If no errors are detected, you see the output in Figure 6-38.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------The ODM has no unsupported elements. Hit <Enter> to continue
```

Press Enter after this last panel, and return to the main menu.

- b. Choose option 3 to enter the repository disk and then select the repository disk that you decided to use (Figure 6-39 on page 303).

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------Select the disk to use for the repository 1       = 00f61ab22b9e1f5c(hdisk2) Select one of the above or "x" to exit:
```

Figure 6-39   Selecting the repository disk

- c. If you agreed on a multicast IP address with your network manager, use it. Otherwise, let AIX generate an appropriate one (Figure 6-40). Whatever you choose, press Enter to get to the next window.
- d. The next window is the initial menu where you choose x to exit the clmigcheck tool (Example 6-38).
- e. Verify whether you are ready for the PowerHA upgrade on the first node by running the clmigcheck tool again. If you are ready, you see the panel that is shown in Figure 6-41 on page 304.

```
------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------PowerHA System Mirror uses multicast address for internal cluster communication and monitoring. These must be in the multicast range, 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255. If you make a NULL entry, AIX will generate an appropriate address for you. You should only specify an address if you have an explicit reason to do so, but are cautioned that this address cannot be changed once the configuration is activated (i.e. migration is complete). h = help Enter the multicast IP address to use for network monitoring:
```

```

Figure 6-41   Confirmation that PowerHA filesets can be upgraded

You can see more details about the actions that are performed by the clmigcheck command that is repeatedly invoked throughout this step in the log file that it creates on the first node, /tmp/clmigcheck/clmigcheck.log .

5. Upgrade PowerHA on the first node to PowerHA 7.1.1 base release.

Perform an update\_all installation by using the base PowerHA 7.1.1 filesets. Do not apply any full service pack or individual fix on top of the base filesets until all nodes in the cluster are upgraded to the new base release. The only exception is the application of interim fixes that are supplied specifically for the base filesets. This application is allowed.

Example 6-39 shows the PowerHA filesets that are updated to the base 7.1.1 release. Run the commands lppchk -v , lppchk -c "cluster.*" , and lslpp -L cluster\* to verify that the upgrade is successful, as shown in Example 6-39.

```

The update process converts the existing local cluster configuration to be compatible with the new software. The conversion details are logged in the /tmp/clconvert.log file. Check this log file to confirm that the conversion succeeded.

6. Start cluster services on this first node by issuing the smitty clstart command. You receive a warning message about mixed versions when the node reintegrates into the

cluster (Figure 6-42 on page 306).

## Migrating an intermediate node

We present the migration procedure for the second node of our 3-node cluster. If your cluster has more than three nodes, this procedure is repeated for each remaining node except the last one. We call them intermediate nodes. If you have a 2-node cluster skip this process, and go to 'Migrating the last node' on page 310. Here are the steps for an intermediate node:

1. Stop the cluster services (our only intermediate node is migr4 ).

Use the move resource group option in the smitty clstop panel. You can also move the resource group on the second node to another node and then stop the cluster services. Check that the resource group moved onto the next node that is available in the priority list and that the cluster is stable (Example 6-42).

Example 6-42   Checking the cluster state after resource group movement

Check that the cluster services are successfully stopped on the current migrated node (Example 6-43). Look for the ST\_INIT status.

```
root@migr4 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep state Current state: ST_INIT root@migr4 / #
```

Example 6-43   Cluster services are stopped on the intermediate node

2. Upgrade AIX on this intermediate node similarly to the process that you used for the first node. Ensure that you installed the required filesets and that AIX is restarted (Example 6-44).

Example 6-44   Checking the AIX upgrade

```
root@migr4 / # uptime 12:05AM   up 1 min,  1 user,  load average: 2.04, 0.51, 0.18 root@migr4 / # oslevel -s 7100-01-03-1207 root@migr4 / # lppchk -v root@migr4 / # lslpp -L bos.cluster\* bos.ahafs bos.clvm.enh|grep -p Level Fileset                      Level  State  Type  Description (Uninstaller) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- bos.ahafs                  7.1.1.2    C     F    Aha File System bos.cluster.rte            7.1.1.3    C     F    Cluster Aware AIX bos.cluster.solid          7.1.1.0    C     F    Cluster Aware AIX SolidDB bos.clvm.enh               7.1.1.0    C     F    Enhanced Concurrent Logical Volume Manager
```

3. Populate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file so that it is the same as on the first node that you upgraded. You can copy it from the first node. Refresh the clcomd daemon. See Example 6-45.

```
root@migr4 / # cat /etc/cluster/rhosts 10.1.1.32 10.1.1.40 10.1.1.72 10.1.2.32 10.1.2.40 10.1.2.72 10.1.3.32 10.1.3.40
```

Example 6-45   Checking the rhost file and refreshing the clcomd daemon

10.1.3.72

```
172.16.21.32 172.16.21.40 172.16.21.75 172.16.21.68 10.10.20.68 root@migr4 / # refresh -s clcomd 0513-095 The request for subsystem refresh was completed successfully. root@migr4 / #
```

4. Run the clmigcheck command on the intermediate node (Example 6-46). This step is important to ensure that you can proceed with the PowerHA upgrade.

Example 6-46   Running clmigcheck on an intermediate node root@migr4 / # clmigcheck ------------[ PowerHA System Mirror Migration Check ]------------clmigcheck: This is not the first node or last node clmigcheck was run on. No further checking is required on this node.  You can install the new version of PowerHA System Mirror. Hit &lt;Enter&gt; to continue root@migr4 / #

5. Upgrade PowerHA on the intermediate node to PowerHA 7.1.1 base release.

Follow the same steps as on the first node to upgrade PowerHA filesets to version 7.1.1.

6. Start the cluster services on the intermediate node.

Issue the smitty clstart command and then check that the cluster is stable and runs the new software (Example 6-47).

```
root@migr4 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep -e state -e version -e vrmf -e fix Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 11 local node vrmf is 7110 cluster fix level is "0" root@migr4 / #
```

Example 6-47   Checking status and new software version on the intermediate node

Move the resource groups back to the intermediate node before you start the migration (Example 6-48). Depending on the fallback policy, the resource group might move automatically on the host node.

Example 6-48   Checking the resource group that moved back on the intermediate node

| root@migr4   | / # clRGinfo           | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |

OFFLINE                      migr3

root@migr4 / #

By performing this task, you finished the migration for an intermediate node. Use the same steps for any other remaining node except the last one if your cluster has more than three nodes.

You are ready to proceed with the migration of the final node in the cluster.

## Migrating the last node

To migrate the last node ( migr5 in our scenario), follow these steps:

1. Stop cluster services on the last node.

If it hosts an online resource group, use the Move resource group option in the smitty clstop panel. You can also move the resource group to another node and then stop the cluster services. Check that the resource group moved onto one of the remaining active nodes and that the cluster is stable.

In our case, the last node does not have a resource group. We check that the cluster services are successfully stopped on the last node only (Example 6-49).

```
root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep state Current state: ST_INIT root@migr5 / #
```

Example 6-49   Checking that the last node cluster is stopped

2. Upgrade AIX on the last node similar to the process that you used for the previous nodes. Ensure that you installed the required filesets and that AIX is restarted (Example 6-50).
3. Populate the /etc/cluster/rhosts file so that it is the same as on the previous nodes that you upgraded. You can copy the file from one of the other nodes. Refresh clcomd (each time that /etc/cluster/rhosts is changed, clcomd must be refreshed).
4. Then, run the clmigcheck command for the last time.

```
root@migr5 / # uptime 02:12AM   up 1 min,  2 users,  load average: 1.30, 0.36, 0.13 root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-01-03-1207 root@migr5 / # lppchk -v root@migr5 / # lslpp -L bos.cluster\* bos.ahafs bos.clvm.enh|grep -p Level Fileset                      Level  State  Type  Description (Uninstaller) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------bos.ahafs                  7.1.1.2    C     F    Aha File System bos.cluster.rte            7.1.1.3    C     F    Cluster Aware AIX bos.cluster.solid          7.1.1.0    C     F    Cluster Aware AIX SolidDB bos.clvm.enh               7.1.1.0    C     F    Enhanced Concurrent Logical Volume Manager
```

Example 6-50   Checking the AIX upgrade on the last node

When the clmigcheck command runs, it recognizes that this node is the last node of the cluster to migrate and it starts to create the CAA cluster. You see the message that is shown in Example 6-51 on page 311.

Move back any resource group hosted by node migr5 before starting the migration. In our case, there was no resource group hosted by the migr5 node.

Run a verification of your migrated cluster to ensure that it operates with no problems. Use the command smit cl\_sync with default options. The output for a successful run of this command is shown in Figure 6-45 on page 320.

## 6.3  Migration from PowerHA 7.1.0

When you migrate a PowerHA 7.1.0 cluster that runs on top of AIX 7.1 TL00 or AIX 6.1 TL06 to PowerHA 7.1.1, you can use either the offline migration method or the snapshot migration method. Rolling migration is not supported in this case.

A PowerHA cluster outage is required to recreate the underlying CAA cluster. A predefined AIX 7.1 TL00 or AIX 6.1 TL06 CAA cluster cannot be migrated to an AIX 7.1 TL01 or AIX 6.1 TL07 CAA cluster. You must first remove the old CAA cluster, and then upgrade the AIX operating system on all involved nodes. Then, you recreate the CAA cluster by using a PowerHA command. This way, you obtain a new cluster instance, by using AIX 7.1 TL01 or AIX 6.1 TL07 code, while you keep the configuration parameters of the previous CAA cluster.

As a preliminary step, apply the latest updates (service packs) that are available for the running versions of AIX (AIX 7.1 TL00 or AIX 6.1 TL06) and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0.

To remove the old CAA cluster instance, you must run the rmcluster -n &lt; clustername &gt; command as root after you stop all PowerHA cluster services in all nodes.

In the offline migration case, you create the CAA cluster instance after you upgrade both the AIX and the PowerHA filesets. Use the clmkcaa PowerHA utility script for this purpose. This script takes the appropriate parameters from the PowerHA configuration files and passes them to the CAA mkcluster command. You do not use the clmigcheck command.

In the snapshot migration case, after you save a cluster snapshot as a first step, you completely uninstall the PowerHA 7.1.0 filesets and then remove the CAA cluster. The next step is to install the new filesets of the PowerHA 7.1.1. With the new code installed, you convert the saved snapshot to PowerHA version 7.1.1 and restore the cluster configuration from the converted snapshot. A new CAA cluster is automatically created during the restoration process.

Demonstration: A demonstration of a 7.1.0 to 7.1.1 snapshot migration is available at this website:

http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/PRS4941

A related scenario is possible when the nodes of a PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 cluster must be upgraded from AIX 7.1 TL00 to AIX 7.1 TL01 (or AIX 6.1 TL06 to AIX 6.1 TL07) while you keep the cluster at version 7.1.0. The steps to perform this upgrade are documented in APAR IV08163:

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IV08163

Appendix A, 'AIX upgrades and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0' on page 531 presents the results of running the steps of this scenario in our test environment.

Demonstration: A demonstration of a CAA update is at this website:

http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/PRS4895

## 6.3.1 Offline migration from PowerHA 7.1.0 version

With the offline migration method, you can migrate the cluster definitions, individually on each node, by updating the PowerHA filesets. The ODM files on the node that runs the update process are converted to the new version.

## Test environment

In our scenario, we begin with PowerHA 7.1.0.1 on top of AIX 7.1.0.1. The target versions are PowerHA 7.1.1.2 and AIX 7.1.1.3, which are the latest available versions at the time of writing this book. The nodes are VIOS client LPARs on different frames that share the SAN LUNs through NPIV. The backing devices are LUNs that are carved in a DS4800 storage subsystem. The network topology is simple, with only one interface per node, which is typical for a virtualized environment. The initial cluster configuration is illustrated in Figure 6-47.

You can see the topology details of our cluster in Example 6-54.

## Preparing the offline migration from PowerHA 7.1.0

Any set of actions that involves modifications at the operating system or cluster level must be preceded by a back-out (reversion) planning, including mandatory backup operations:

- Back up all data and binaries of the applications.
- Take a cluster snapshot and save it locally and to another machine.
- Save a copy of any custom script files locally and to another machine.
- Perform a mksysb backup of each involved node.

This back-out plan allows easy restoration of the application data, binaries, cluster configuration, and AIX configuration if you encounter into problems.

Perform the usual software consistency checks:

- Ensure that all nodes are at the same level of operating system and cluster software. Check that the cluster software is committed (and not merely applied). Use the oslevel -s and the lslpp -L cluster\* commands.
- Verify that the software is consistent on all nodes by using the lppchk -v command.

Before you start the actual migration, check the overall status of your cluster:

1. Ensure that the cluster is started on all nodes, is stable, and in a normal operating state. Run the clmgr view report status command on either node and check the state of the cluster, resource groups, interfaces, and System Resource Controller (SRC) subsystems (Example 6-55).

You might get the equivalent status information by using other Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based commands such as cldump or clstat -o that are combined with clshowsrv -v . Also, instead of SNMP-based commands, you can use lssrc -ls clstrmgrES , clRGinfo , and netstat -in .

2. Ensure that the cluster has no pending configuration changes on any of its nodes.

Use the command clcmd odmget HACMPcluster | egrep "NODE|handle" (Example 6-56).

Example 6-56   Checking pending configuration changes

```
root@migr5 / # clcmd odmget HACMPcluster | egrep "NODE|handle" NODE migr6 handle = 2 NODE migr5 handle = 1 root@migr5 / #
```

A non-zero value for the handle parameter on each node means that there are no pending changes so you can go to the next step.

A zero value for the handle parameter on a node means that changes are pending on that node. If changes are pending on one node and you choose to apply them on top of the

current configuration, check them, decide on a final configuration, and run a 'Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration' operation. In an active cluster, there are some changes that might not be allowed. If you really need these changes, you have to stop the cluster services.

If you decide to cancel any pending changes on any node and to keep the currently active configuration, on either node, run smit sysmirror . Select Problem Determination Tools  Restore PowerHA SystemMirror Configuration Database from Active Configuration . Select Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration on the same node. You might avoid the last synchronization by restoring the default cluster configuration from the active configuration on each of the cluster nodes.

3. Check that the cluster has no configuration errors.

Select Verify Cluster Configuration on either cluster node by starting smitty sysmirror and selecting Problem Determination Tools  PowerHA SystemMirror Verification  Verify Cluster Configuration . Use No for the 'Verify changes only?' field and press Enter. The result is shown in Figure 6-49.

## Performing the offline migration from PowerHA 7.1.0

To perform the offline migration, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that all nodes in the cluster run the same and most recent version of the AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror software.

Identify the latest updates (service packs) that are available for the current versions of AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror on your cluster nodes. Apply these service packs (SPs) to eliminate any known problem that might affect the migration.

```
PowerHA level and SP: Consider the following procedure to discover the PowerHA level and SP that are installed (the halevel command has a man page): # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/halevel 7.1.0 # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/halevel -s 7.1.0 SP5
```

In our test environment, we start from AIX 7.1 TL00 SP01 and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 SP01 (Example 6-57).

```
root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-01-1037 root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12
```

Example 6-58   Initial cluster state and software versions

```
local node vrmf is 7101 cluster fix level is "1" root@migr5 / # root@migr6 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-01-1037 root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7101 cluster fix level is "1" root@migr6 / #
```

We update to the latest levels that are available at the time of writing this book: AIX 7.1 TL00 SP04 and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 SP05. Then, we ensure that everything is OK after the update by running again a 'Verify and Synchronize' operation, followed by a cluster startup and status check (Example 6-59).

Example 6-59   Cluster state and software versions after we apply the latest service packs

```
root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-04-1140 root@migr5 / # lppchk -v root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7105 cluster fix level is "5" root@migr5 / # root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-04-1140 root@migr5 / # lppchk -v root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7105 cluster fix level is "5" root@migr5 / #
```

2. Stop the cluster services on all nodes.

Use the smitty clstop command. Select all nodes and choose Bring Resource Groups Offline as an action on resource groups (Figure 6-50 on page 330).

Stop Cluster Services

Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes.

## 3. Remove CAA.

Use lscluster and lspv to obtain information about the cluster name and repository disk PVID (Example 6-61).

```
root@migr5 / # lscluster -d Storage Interface Query Cluster Name:  clmigr56 Cluster uuid:  b450137e-83f8-11e1-9636-b6fcca1bda70 Number of nodes reporting = 2 Number of nodes expected = 2 Node migr5 Node uuid = 8e041058-797b-11e1-8b14-b6fcca1bda70 Number of disk discovered = 1 caa_private0 state : UP uDid  : uUid  : acffc231-fb7e-bb0d-b3f2-08eebe201a81 type  : REPDISK Node migr6 Node uuid = ae4b0e20-797b-11e1-9063-2e479566c670 Number of disk discovered = 1 caa_private0 state : UP
```

Use the command rmcluster -n &lt; clustername &gt; on either node to remove the CAA cluster. Then, check that it is successfully removed with the lscluster -m command on both nodes (Example 6-62).

Example 6-62   Removing the CAA cluster

```
root@migr6 / # rmcluster -n clmigr56 rename them. root@migr6 / # lscluster -m Cluster services are not active. root@migr6 / # root@migr5 / # lscluster -m Cluster services are not active. root@migr5 / #
```

rmcluster: Removed cluster shared disks are automatically renamed to names such as hdisk10, [hdisk11, ...] on all cluster nodes.  However, this cannot take place while a disk is busy or on a node which is down or not reachable.  If any disks cannot be renamed now, you must manually

The previous repository disk, with 00f74d47797a84d6 as the PVID, is now clean of any CAA LVM structure on any node. In our case, it is renamed to hdisk2 (Example 6-63).

Repository disk PVID: If problems appear, call IBM support. You must not try any action that might change the PVID of the repository disk. The PVID is required later to recreate the CAA cluster with the same repository disk.

4. Upgrade the AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror software on all nodes in the cluster.

Upgrade the AIX to version 7.1 TL01 SP2 or later by using a supported procedure. In our scenario, we upgrade to the latest level that is available at the time of this writing, AIX 7.1 TL01 SP03. Ensure that you rebooted the systems after the upgrade (Example 6-64).

```
root@migr5 / # uptime 11:16AM   up   1:38,  1 user,  load average: 1.27, 1.24, 1.17 root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-01-03-1207 root@migr5 / # lppchk -v root@migr5 / # root@migr6 / # uptime 11:16AM   up   1:38,  1 user,  load average: 1.19, 1.26, 1.16 root@migr6 / # oslevel -s 7100-01-03-1207 root@migr6 / # lppchk -v root@migr6 / #
```

Example 6-64   Checking AIX upgrade

AIX Upgrade: Use a supported upgrade procedure and appropriate software sources (download or media); otherwise, you might overwrite configuration files. For example, if you use AIX 7.1 TL01 base media to update from AIX7.1 TL00, you might overwrite the /etc/cluster/rhosts file.

Proceed with the upgrade of the PowerHA filesets to version 7.1.1 or later. In our scenario, we also apply the SP02 Service Pack for PowerHA 7.1.1, which is the latest available SP at the time of developing this publication (Example 6-65).

```

Important: Now, it is not possible to recreate the CAA cluster by using a 'Verify and Synchronize' operation. We are in the middle of the migration because the ODM files are converted during the upgrade of the PowerHA filesets.

Verify that the CAA services are active on each node by running the /usr/sbin/lscluster -m command (Example 6-68).

```
root@migr5 / # lscluster -m Calling node query for all nodes Node query number of nodes examined: 2

```

Figure 6-51   Cluster starts OK on the first node

Then, ensure that the node successfully joins the cluster (Example 6-70). Although the software is updated at the 7.1.1 level, the node still runs at version 12.

## Example 6-70   First node joined the cluster

```
root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7112 cluster fix level is "2" root@migr5 / #
```

Repeat the procedure for each node of the cluster, one node at a time.

After you start the cluster services on the latest node and it joins the cluster, you can check the cluster version update (Example 6-71).

## Example 6-71   Last node joins the cluster

```
root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_JOINING CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 0 cluster fix level is "ffffffff" root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_BARRIER

## 6.3.2 Snapshot migration from 7.1.0 version

With the snapshot migration, we preserve the entire PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 cluster configuration by creating a snapshot of the configuration. Here, we uninstall the PowerHA 7.1.0 after we take the snapshot. The CAA cluster must be removed before we upgrade AIX. The snapshot is later used after the PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 is installed in the cluster.

## Test environment

In our scenario, we begin with PowerHA 7.1.0.5 on top of AIX 7.1.0.1. The target versions are PowerHA 7.1.1.2 and AIX 7.1.1.3, which are the latest version available at the time of this writing. The nodes are VIOS client LPARs on different frames that share the SAN LUNs from the storage device DS4800 through NPIV. The initial cluster configuration is illustrated in Figure 6-53.

## PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 cluster configuration

The cluster contains one resource group ihs\_resgrp , which hosts the IBM HTTP Server application. The resource uses IPAT via IP Alias for the service IP . The home node for ihs\_resgrp is clmgr1 . The clmgr2 node has a standby role. Figure 6-54 displays the existing configuration of PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0, which is planned for snapshot migration.

```

## Preparing the snapshot migration from PowerHA 7.1.0

Take a snapshot of the cluster configuration from the existing cluster environment. The snapshot still needs to be restored on a new version of PowerHA. To avoid any issues during the restoration process and also to have a revert back solution, ensure that you take a backup of all application data and binaries and any custom scripts that are used in the cluster configuration and a mksysb backup of all nodes.

Before you create the snapshot of the existing cluster configuration, verify the following information:

1. Check whether the cluster status is stable as shown in Example 6-73.

```
root@clmgr1 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES | grep state ; clRGinfo Current state: ST_STABLE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Example 6-73   Cluster state before migration

| Group Name   | Group State -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   | Node          |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| ihs_resgrp   | ONLINE OFFLINE                                                                              | clmgr1 clmgr2 |

2. Check whether the cluster has any pending changes on any node as shown in Example 6-74.

```
root@clmgr1 / # clcmd odmget HACMPcluster | egrep "NODE|handle" NODE clmgr2 handle = 2 NODE clmgr1 handle = 1
```

Example 6-74   Checking pending configuration changes

If both nodes display a non-zero value for the handle parameter as shown in Example 6-74, the cluster does not have pending changes on any node.

3. Check whether the cluster has any configuration errors.

Run Verify Cluster Configuration on either cluster node by starting smitty sysmirror and selecting Problem Determination Tools  PowerHA SystemMirror Verification  Verify Cluster Configuration . Use No for the 'Verify changes only?' field and press Enter. The result is similar to Figure 6-55.

## Creating a Snapshot on PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0

After you verify the cluster status and existing cluster configuration, you can proceed to create a snapshot of the cluster configuration by using smit sysmirror . Select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the cluster  Snapshot Configuration  Create a Snapshot of the Cluster Configuration .

Enter the snapshot name and description as shown in Figure 6-56 on page 345.

Figure 6-56   Creating a snapshot

<!-- image -->

The snapshot creates two files, 710Snapshot.odm and 710Snapshot.info , as shown in Figure 6-57. Keep a backup copy of these snapshot files and preserve it until the migration is completed successfully. We use these files after PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 is installed on the cluster. Stop the cluster services on all nodes.

## Removal of the CAA cluster

Use the lscluster and the lspv commands to get information about the cluster name and repository disk PVID as shown in Example 6-77.

Example 6-77   CAA cluster information details

```
root@clmgr1 /opt/IBM# lscluster -d Storage Interface Query Cluster Name:  ihs_cluster Cluster uuid:  2355f8de-904b-11e1-a908-b6fcc07d1d70 Number of nodes reporting = 2 Number of nodes expected = 2 Node clmgr1 Node uuid = c0269ec0-8f74-11e1-9fff-b6fcc07d1d70 Number of disk discovered = 1 caa_private0 state : UP uDid  : uUid  : 39597db5-d0b8-5741-3e06-095cd9da92e7 type  : REPDISK Node clmgr2 Node uuid = 91c788b8-8f75-11e1-8992-6e8dde31d770 Number of disk discovered = 1 caa_private0 state : UP uDid  : uUid  : 39597db5-d0b8-5741-3e06-095cd9da92e7 type  : REPDISK root@clmgr1 /opt/IBM# root@clmgr1 /opt/IBM# lspv hdisk0          00f74d471c3abc13                    rootvg          active hdisk1          00f74d4733c60118                    rootvg          active caa_private0    00f74d4733c91f39                    caavg_private   active hdisk3          00f74d4733c9370e                    ihsvg root@clmgr1 /opt/IBM# root@clmgr1 # lspv | grep caa caa_private0    00f74d4733c91f39                    caavg_private   active bash-3.00#
```

Use the command rmcluster -n &lt; cluster name &gt; on either node to remove the CAA cluster, then check whether it is removed with the cluster -m command on both nodes (Example 6-78).

Example 6-78   Removing the CAA cluster

```
root@clmgr1#  lscluster -c Cluster query for cluster ihs_cluster returns: Cluster uuid: d5de798c-82ee-11e1-90df-b6fcc07d1d70 Number of nodes in cluster = 2 Cluster id for node clmgr1 is 1 Primary IP address for node clmgr1 is 10.1.1.54 Cluster id for node clmgr2 is 2
```

```
Primary IP address for node clmgr2 is 10.1.1.55
```

```
Number of disks in cluster = 0 Multicast address for cluster is 228.1.1.36 root@clmgr1# rmcluster -n ihs_cluster rmcluster: Removed cluster shared disks are automatically renamed to names such as hdisk10, [hdisk11, ...] on all cluster nodes.  However, this cannot take place while a disk is busy or on a node which is down or not reachable.  If any disks cannot be renamed now, you must manually rename them by removing them from the ODM database and then running the cfgmgr command to recreate them with default names.  For example: rmdev -l cldisk1 -d rmdev -l cldisk2 -d cfgmgr root@clmgr1# lscluster -m Cluster services are not active root@clmgr1# root@clmgr2# lscluster -m Cluster services are not active root@clmgr2#
```

The successful execution of the rmcluster command removes the volume group caavg\_private on all nodes of the cluster as shown in Figure 6-58.

```
root@clmgr1# lspv | grep hdisk2 hdisk2 00f74d4733c91f39 None root@clmgr2# lspv | grep hdisk2 hdisk2 00f74d4733c91f39                    None
```

## Uninstall PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0

Uninstall the PowerHA 7.1.0 cluster filesets from all nodes by using installp as shown in Figure 6-59.

```
root@clmgr1# installp -ug cluster.adt.* cluster.es.* cluster.doc.* cluster.license
```

Figure 6-59 Uninstalling cluster filesets

Ensure that you uninstalled the cluster filesets on all nodes by using the commands that are shown in Figure 6-60 on page 348.

```
root@clmgr1# lslpp -l | grep cluster.* bos.cluster.rte            7.1.0.1  COMMITTED  Cluster Aware AIX bos.cluster.solid          7.1.0.0  COMMITTED  Cluster Aware AIX SolidDB root@clmgr1# installp -C installp: No filesets were found in the Software Vital Product Database that could be cleaned up.
```

```

## Installing PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1

Install the base filesets of PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 on all nodes and install the latest service packs. For more details, see 3.7, 'PowerHA SystemMirror installation and prerequisites' on page 91.

## Converting the snapshot to support PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1

By using the previously taken snapshot configuration files, execute the command that is shown in Example 6-80. The successful execution of this command renames the existing 710Snapshot.odm file to 710Snapshot.odm.old and creates a 710Snapshot.odm file.

```
root@clmgr1# /usr/es/sbin/cluster/conversion/clconvert_snapshot -v 7.1.0 -s 710Snapshot Extracting ODM's from snapshot file... done. Converting extracted ODM's... done.

## Syslog and CAA

Ensure that you have an entry in the /etc/syslog.conf file to capture CAA logs. Ensure that the host names of all cluster nodes that resolve to their respective IP addresses are added in the /etc/cluster/rhosts file. Restart clcomd as shown in the Example 6-81.

```
root@clmgr1 / # tail -1 /etc/syslog.conf *.info /var/adm/ras/syslog.caa rotate size 1m files 10 root@clmgr1 / # tail -2 /etc/cluster/rhosts clmgr1 clmgr2
```

Example 6-81   Syslog and CAA rhosts file entries

root@clmgr1 / # stopsrc -s clcomd; sleep 2; startsrc -s clcomd;

## Restoring the cluster by using the converted snapshot file

We can restore the converted snapshot cluster configuration file by using smit sysmirror . Start smit sysmirror and select Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the cluster  Snapshot Configuration  Restore the Cluster Configuration From a Snapshot .

Select the snapshot file name and press Enter as shown in Figure 6-61.

Figure 6-61 Restoring the snapshot configuration

<!-- image -->

The successful restoration of the snapshot configuration files restores the cluster configuration of PowerHA 7.1.1 and creates the volume group caavg\_private in the repository disk. You can verify the caavg\_private volume group on either cluster node as shown in Example 6-82 on page 350.

```
root@clmgr1# lspv | grep caa hdisk2          00f74d4733c91f39                    caavg_private   active
```

Check the cluster configuration on all nodes and confirm that the CAA cluster state is error free as shown in Example 6-83.

```

## IBM PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for SAP

This chapter describes the functionality of the PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for SAP , which provides high availability for SAP services.

This chapter includes the following topics:

- PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for SAP
- Standard steps for all clusters in this chapter
- Simple cluster solution with IBM PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for monolithic installed SAP systems
- Scenario for a complete SAP and liveCache environment:
- -Cluster 1: SAP Supply Chain Management
- -Cluster 2: Database instance
- -Cluster 3: liveCache
- DB2 HADR cluster solution

## 7.1  PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for SAP

PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for SAP is included in the Standard Edition software at no additional charge. It simplifies and minimizes the time and effort to make an SAP system highly available. The Smart Assist automatically discovers SAP instances and databases and creates start and stop scripts for the instances. The Smart Assist also creates process and custom PowerHA application monitors that help to keep the SAP instances highly available.

The first Smart Assist for SAP is offered with PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.

This chapter is presented in two parts. The first part shows a one-cluster solution that combines the SAP services and the database in one cluster. The second part explains how to configure a three-cluster SAP Supply Chain Management (SCM)/Advanced Planning and Optimization (APO) solution with a hot-standby liveCache installation. All three clusters are two-node IBM PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 clusters that use the Smart Assist for SAP .

The simple cluster solution is to provide a solution for older monolithic SAP installations if no separate instance or installation for ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS) or the database exists. For new installations, you can also set up a one-cluster solution. However, all SAP instances (database, ASCS, Enqueue Replication Server (ERS), and primary application server) must be installed separately and be able to operate independently. If not, you interfere with the SAP strategy for high availability solutions.

The three cluster solution is the preferred setup. It complies with the SAP strategy to use a stand-alone enqueue server with an optional replicated enqueue. Also, from the PowerHA perspective, this design is the focal solution.

7.8, 'DB2 HADR cluster solution' on page 463 provides a sample configuration for a DB2 high availability disaster recovery (HADR) cluster. You can exchange the Smart Assist cluster 2 with this solution if you need faster takeover times. There is no Smart Assist for this solution.

Terminology: For better differentiation, in this book, the SAP central instance without a message and enqueue server (in the past also called DVEBMGS) is called the primary application server. Further dialog instances are called additional application servers.

## 7.1.1  Different Smart Assists

Different Smart Assists in the PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1 for AIX Standard Edition are used for this chapter. The central component is the Smart Assist for SAP , which you can install with the cluster.es.assist.sap fileset. But this Smart Assist for SAP is built on top of another Smart Assist. The Standard Smart Assist is the basic part, and it is installed with the cluster.es.assist.common fileset.

The Smart Assist for Network File System (NFS) is in the cluster.es.nfs.rte fileset.

If you want to make the database highly available with the Smart Assist for SAP , you also must install the following filesets, depending on the database:

- cluster.es.assist.db2 for DB2
- cluster.es.assist.maxdb for MaxDB
- cluster.es.assist.oracle for Oracle

For the Smart Assist for SAP liveCache Hot Standby, one more Smart Assist is necessary. It is installed with the cluster.es.assist.maxdb fileset.

But everything is configured inside the Smart Assist for SAP except the liveCache part. There are different subtypes inside the Smart Assist for SAP:

- Global file system (GFS):

This subtype discovers and configures the NFS shared file systems in an SAP environment ( /usr/sap/trans and /sapmnt ) and uses as the base layer the Smart Assist for NFS.

Important: This GFS subtype is mandatory as the basic subtype to discover all other Smart Assist for SAP subtypes. It uses only NFS version 4.

- Central services (SCS):

This subtype discovers and configures the central services instances, which are the SCS and also ASCS instances.

- Enqueue Replication Server (ERS):
- This subtype discovers and configures the enqueue replication instance for a central service instance, which is the ERS named instance.
- Application server (AS):

This subtype discovers and configures all application server instances, including both primary application server instances and additional application server instances.

- Database (DB)

This subtype discovers and configures a highly available environment for a DB2 or Oracle database and uses as a base layer the Smart Assist for DB2 or the Smart Assist for Oracle.

## 7.1.2 Prerequisites of the solution

The solution requires these prerequisites:

- The use of the NFS service of the Smart Assist for SAP is required with this version of PowerHA. The SAP globals must be configured as the base of NFS 4 inside the cluster for the SAP central services. This requirement applies for /sapmnt/&lt; SID &gt; and /usr/sap/trans . It prevents you from setting up a second cluster with Smart Assist for SAP in a three-system SAP landscape with development, quality assurance, and a productive system, except that you use a remote transport system within SAP . The Smart Assist for SAP subtype NFS only supports NFS version 4.
- For the Smart Assists to work correctly, you must not have a second file system whose mount point begins with /usr/sap/trans or /sapmnt . The Smart Assist for SAP is not able to detect the NFS service for these file systems.
- There is no Smart Assist implementation for DB2 HADR. However, the use of the solution without Smart Assist that is shown in 'DB2 HADR cluster solution' is possible.
- The Smart Assist for SAP supports ABAP and dual-stack SAP installations only. It does not support the pure JAVA stack.
- The service addresses are always configured on the first known PowerHA network in the cluster. If you use more networks and want to configure your service addresses on these networks, you must set up the service address on the correct network after the Smart Assist runs manually.

## 7.1.3 Supported versions by Smart Assist

In this section, you see a listing of the supported versions of SAP , DB2, and MaxDB for Smart Assist for SAP , and its dependent Smart Assist:

The supported version by the PowerHA Smart Assist for SAP is SAP NetWeaver 2004s.

The supported version by the PowerHA Smart Assist for DB2 is IBM DB2 Universal Database™ Enterprise Server Edition versions 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, and 9.5.

The supported version by the PowerHA Smart Assist for MaxDB is SAP MaxDB 7.6 and 7.7.

The supported stack by the PowerHA Smart Assist for SAP liveCache Hot Standby at the time of writing this publication includes the following products:

- -The suggested version for AIX is SAP MaxDB Version 7.7.07.39 or later
- -SAP SCM 7.0 EHP1
- -SAP Database DB2 V9.7 or Oracle 10g2
- -Storage:
- SAN Volume Controller
- V7000
- DS8000 with flashcopy

Obtain a current list of supported SCMs in the Product Availability Matrix (PAM) on the SAP marketplace, if SCM is the clustered base on the Smart Assist.

Important: Use the latest PowerHA service pack because of improved logic to control the applications.

## 7.2.2 Creating the users

The SAPinst creates all necessary users for DB2, SAP , or MaxDB if they cannot be found on the local system. SAPinst creates the user only on the first node and sets the SAP default home directories and the master password for all these users. If you want special directories and different passwords, you create the users before you start the installation. Or, you can

use Cluster Single Point of Control (C-SPOC) to create the users with PowerHA SystemMirror functionality. If you do not use C-SPOC to create the users and groups, you have to ensure that the same users (with the same passwords) and groups are created on the second node.

Important: The users and groups have to be created with the same ID on both nodes.

Complete sample scripts to create the users and groups (before SAPinst is started and without using C-SPOC) can be found in 'Scripts to create the SAP users' on page 604.

## 7.2.3  Creating volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems

You must create the volume groups, logical volumes, and the file systems before you start the SAPinst. Use the C-SPOC functionality with the PowerHA instruments or write your own script. Y ou have to import the shared volume groups on the second node. If you use this method, use the same major number on the second node to prevent NFS problems. C-SPOC performs all required tasks on the second node automatically.

Example scripts for each environment in the demonstration environment can be found in 'Scripts to create the volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems' on page 605.

Important: For the Smart Assists to work correctly, do not have a second file system whose mount point begins with /usr/sap/trans or /sapmnt ; otherwise, the Smart Assist cannot detect the NFS service.

Important: Smart Assist for SAP with subtype DB2 and liveCache automatically imports the volume groups on the backup node if the volume group is not manually imported earlier. GFS and all other subtypes do not work with this automation. In this case, you must manually import the volume group in advance.

## 7.2.4  Updating the /etc/services file on the secondary node

When the instance is created on the primary node, the /etc/services file is updated with information for SAP usage. You must also add the lines that the sapinst created on the installing node to the /etc/services file on the secondary node. There are two ways to make these entries on the second side available. The first and the easiest way is to copy the complete file simply to the second node, ideally with the same timestamp. This method can be used only if both files are the same before the start of the SAPinst after the SAPinst finished and there are only additional lines on the first node:

root@sapsma1 / # clrcp /etc/services sapsma2:/etc/services

A better method is to use this command:

root@sapsma1 / # scp -p /etc/services sapsma2:/etc/services

The second method is to add every necessary line on the second node with an AIX command, for example:

root@sapsma2 / # chservices -a -v sapgw99s -p tcp -n 4899 -u "SAP System Gateway Security Port"

## 7.2.5 Copying more directories to the second node

SAP and DB2 can be started on the second cluster, and you have to copy more files and directories manually to the other node. In our environment, we copy the following files and directories that are local on the first node to the second node:

- root@sapsma1 / # scp -pr /var/db2 sapsma2:/var/db2
- root@sapsma1 / # scp -pr /usr/sap/* sapsma2:/usr/sap/

Important: Use the second command only if all shared file systems are unmounted.

Important: You cannot use the clrcp command for this step because it works with files only, not with directories.

## 7.3  Simple cluster solution with IBM PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for monolithic installed SAP systems

We provide a simple cluster solution description with IBM PowerHA Smart Assist for monolithic installed SAP systems.

## 7.3.1  Overview

We show how you can make an existing SAP system highly available. In this environment, we use the SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EHP2 installation with DB2 as the underlying database. We present two alternatives to make the SAP system highly available.

Alternative A for existing SAP installations is shown in Figure 7-1 on page 365.

Figure 7-1   Schema overview alternative A for sapsma\_cluster

<!-- image -->

In Figure 7-1, the SAP system is installed as a monolithic SAP central system with an included database with only one volume group (VG) for the database and the SAP system and only one service address for both. The Smart Assist for SAP can only be used to set up an application server instance. Because of this consideration, there is no monitoring that is configured by the Smart Assist for SAP for the database instance.

## Figure 7-1 shows these main steps:

- Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for SAP
- Starting Smart Assist for SAP: Global file system (NFS)
- Starting Smart Assist for SAP: Application server instance (AS)
- Completing the configuration

Alternative B is shown in Figure 7-2 on page 366.

Figure 7-2   Schema overview alternative B for sapsma\_cluster

<!-- image -->

Figure 7-2 uses a separate installation for the SAP central instance (DVEBMGS). The message and enqueue server (with no separated ASCS like alternative A) and the database each has its own volume group and service address. In this example, the Smart Assist for SAP configures monitoring for the database instance and the SAP system.

## Figure 7-2 has these main steps:

- Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for SAP
- Starting Smart Assist for SAP: Global file system (NFS)
- Alternative B only: Starting Smart Assist for SAP with the database instance
- Starting Smart Assist for SAP: Application server instance (AS)
- Completing the configuration

Unless otherwise explained, the step is for both alternatives.

## 7.3.2  Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for SAP

The steps for the installation and configuration preparation are listed with some steps that are shown only as a link to the detailed described steps in 7.2, 'Standard steps for all clusters in this chapter' on page 362. We explain the preliminary steps that are required before you can start Smart Assist for SAP:

1. Install the required PowerHA Smart Assist filesets.

See 7.2.1, 'Installing the required PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist filesets' on page 362.

## 2. Configure the base IBM PowerHA SystemMirror.

You must configure the topology of the PowerHA cluster before you use the Smart Assist for SAP as shown in the previous chapters. Example 7-6 shows the cluster sapsma\_cluster that is configured with two Ethernet interfaces in each node.

```
root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # lscluster -c Cluster query for cluster sapsma_cluster returns: Cluster uuid: 46837bf4-71f3-11e1-a1c9-6e8dd5fb9f6f Number of nodes in cluster = 2 Cluster id for node sapsma1b1 is 3 Primary IP address for node sapsma1b1 is 10.1.1.52 Cluster id for node sapsma2b1 is 4 Primary IP address for node sapsma2b1 is 10.1.1.53 Number of disks in cluster = 0 Multicast address for cluster is 228.1.1.27 root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # cllsif Adapter Type Network Net Type Attribute Node IP Address Hardware Address Interface Name Global Name Netmask Alias for HB Prefix Length sapsma1b2 boot admin_net ether public sapsma1 10.1.2.52 en1 255.255.255.0 24
```

Example 7-6   Cluster network configuration

```
sapsma1b1 boot service_net ether public sapsma1 10.1.1.52 en0 255.255.254.0 23 sapsma2b2 boot admin_net ether public sapsma2 10.1.2.53 en1 255.255.255.0 24 sapsma2b1 boot service_net ether public sapsma2 10.1.1.53 en0 255.255.254.0 23
```

## 3. Configure the network.

The IP addresses for the NFS server ( sapsmasvc2 ) and the SAP system ( sapsmasvc1 ) are configured on the node where SAP is active.

Alternative A: Example 7-7 shows the network settings for alternative A.

4. Create the users and groups.

See 7.2.2, 'Creating the users' on page 362 and the script to create the users in the 'Script to create users and groups for sapsma\_cluster' on page 604.

5. Create volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems.

See 7.2.3, 'Creating volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems' on page 363, and the script to create the volume groups and file systems in the 'Script to create VGs and LVs for sapsma\_cluster' on page 605.

Example 7-9 shows the volume groups that are known to both nodes.

Important: For the Smart Assists for SAP subtype NFS to work correctly, do not have a second file system whose mount point begins with /usr/sap/trans or /sapmnt . Smart Assist cannot detect the NFS service correctly.

## 6. Set up NFS.

Configure an NFS domain on both nodes because the Smart Assist for SAP uses NFS version 4:

root@sapsma1 / # clcmd chnfsdom sapsma\_cluster

The NFS server exports all needed file systems as shown in Example 7-12.

Example 7-12   NFS server on sapsma1

root@sapsma1 / # exportfs /export/sapmnt/TE1 -sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapsma1:sapsma2:sapsma1b2:sapsma2b2:sapsma svc2:sapsmasvc4 /export/saptrans/TE1 -sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapsma1:sapsma2:sapsma1b2:sapsma2b2:sapsma svc2:sapsmasvc4

The NFS client mounts are available as shown in Example 7-13.

Example 7-13   NFS mounts on sapsma1

nfs3   Mar 23 10:33

root@sapsma1 / # mount|grep nfs

sapsmasvc2 /export/sapmnt/TE1 /sapmnt/TE1

sapsmasvc2 /export/saptrans/TE1 /usr/sap/trans   nfs3

Mar 23 10:34

## 7. Install SAP .

We performed a normal SAP installation with the virtual SAP host name. Only the usual SAP parameters are set as shown in Example 7-14.

Example 7-14   SAPinst environment parameters

```
export TMPDIR=/tmp/TE1 mkdir $TMPDIR export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java14_64 ./sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=sapsmasvc1
```

Complete a standard SAPinst installation.

Important: Smart Assist SAP with subtype DB2 and Smart Assist for DB2 support only non-Distributed Print Function (DPF) and non-HADR DB2 databases.

After the SAPinst installation, start the SAP instance if it is not running as shown in Example 7-15.

Example 7-15   Start SAP on sapsma1

sapsma1:te1adm 1&gt; startsap sapsmasvc1

```

```

Check whether DB2 is running as shown in Example 7-16.

Example 7-16   DB2 is running on sapsma1

```
sapsma1:db2te1 1> db2pd Database Partition 0 -- Active -- Up 0 days 00:02:01 -- Date 03/23/2012 19:06:23
```

Check whether the SAP instance is active as shown in Example 7-17.

## Example 7-17   SAP is running on sapsma1

sapsma1:te1adm 5&gt; /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapcontrol -prot NI\_HTTP -nr 02 -function GetProcessList 23.03.2012 19:19:40 GetProcessList OK name, description, dispstatus, textstatus, starttime, elapsedtime, pid msg\_server, MessageServer, GREEN, Running, 2012 03 23 19:05:02, 0:14:38, 10420250 disp+work, Dispatcher, GREEN, Running, Message Server connection ok, Dialog Queue time: 0.00 sec, 2012 03 23 19:05:02, 0:14:38, 10616962 igswd\_mt, IGS Watchdog, GREEN, Running, 2012 03 23 19:05:02, 0:14:38, 9764996

Important: The Smart Assist for DB2 uses the db2gcf command to start the database in a PowerHA environment. It does not change the db2nodes.cfg directly.

8. Update the /etc/services file on the secondary node.

See 7.2.4, 'Updating the /etc/services file on the secondary node' on page 363.

9. Copy the additional directories.

See 7.2.5, 'Copying more directories to the second node' on page 364.

- 10.Set up the DB2 environment variable.

Find the path for the binary files and then export the variable as shown in Example 7-18 on page 372. The DSE\_INSTALL\_DIR environment variable is exported as a root user with the actual path for the DB2 binary files. If more than one DB2 version is installed, choose the version that you use for this highly available instance.

Example 7-18   Finding the DB2 binary files and exporting them

root@sapsma1 / # /db2/TE1/db2te1/db2\_software/bin/db2level DB21085I  Instance "db2te1" uses "64" bits and DB2 code release "SQL09074" with level identifier "08050107". Informational tokens are "DB2 v9.7.0.4", "s110330", "IP23236", and Fix Pack "4". Product is installed at " /db2/db2te1/db2\_software ".

root@sapsma1 / # export DSE\_INSTALL\_DIR=/db2/db2te1/db2\_software

Important: The setting of this variable is necessary. Without the seeded variable DSE\_INSTALL\_DIR, the Smart Assist for SAP cannot find the appropriate database.

11.Check what the Smart Assist for SAP can discover as shown in Example 7-19.

You can check the possible types on the command line. All located types have a ' 1 ' at the end. The following parameters are available for the cl\_sapdiscover -t command:

- -GFS
- -SCS
- -AS
- -ERS
- -DB

Example 7-19   Checking the Smart Assist for SAP discover function

```
root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # ./cl_sapdiscover -t GFS SAP Smart Assist:SAPNW_7.0:1.SAP NW 7.0 Global Filesystem:SAPNW_7.0_SAPGFS: 1 root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # ./cl_sapdiscover -t AS SAP Smart Assist:SAPNW_7.0:4.SAP NW 7.0 AS Instance:SAPNW_7.0_ASINSTANCE: 1 root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # ./cl_sapdiscover -t SCS SAP Smart Assist:SAPNW_7.0:2.SAP NW 7.0 SCS Instance:SAPNW_7.0_SCSINSTANCE: 0 root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # ./cl_sapdiscover -t ERS SAP Smart Assist:SAPNW_7.0:3.SAP NW 7.0 ERS Instance:SAPNW_7.0_ERSINSTANCE: 0 root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # ./cl_sapdiscover -t DB SAP Smart Assist:SAPNW_7.0:5.SAP Database Instance:SAPNW_7.0_DBINSTANCE: 1
```

## 12.Get trace information.

More information can be collected by setting an additional environment variable as shown in Example 7-20.

```
root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # export VERBOSE_LOGGING="high" root@sapsma1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # ./cl_sapdiscover -t GFS ...
```

Example 7-20   Setting enlarged output for cl\_sapdiscover

## 13.Determine the PowerHA state.

You can start the PowerHA Smart Assist on a running cluster or on a cluster in the INIT state, but both nodes must be in the same state.

## 7.3.3 Starting Smart Assist for SAP: Global file system (NFS)

After you complete the steps in the previous sections, you are ready to start Smart Assist for SAP as explained in the following steps:

1. Launch Smart Assist for SAP by using the path for sapsma1: smitty sysmirror  Cluster Applications and Resources  Make Applications Highly Available (Use Smart Assists)  Add an Application to the PowerHA SystemMirror Configuration .

```

Figure 7-7   Additional entries for the Smart Assist

Important: There is an automatic synchronization after you press Enter; therefore, press Enter only if the cluster is not running.

Important: If you configure the SAP global file system details on a running cluster, errors occur. The cluster synchronizes and tries to start the new resource group, then it has problems when it tries to unmount the manually mounted file systems. To prevent this error, unmount everything manually before you press Enter.

7. The following warning might appear as shown in Figure 7-8 on page 375.

```
WARNING: Node sapsma2 has cluster.es.nfs.rte installed however grace periods are not fully enabled on this node. Grace periods must be enabled before NFSv4 stable storage can be used. PowerHA SystemMirror will attempt to fix this opportunistically when acquiring NFS resources on this node however the change won't take effect until the next time that nf sd is started. If this warning persists, the administrator should perform the following steps to enable grace periods on sapsma2 at the next planned downtime: 1. stopsrc -s nfsd 2. smitty nfsgrcperiod 3. startsrc -s nfsd
```

Figure 7-8   Cluster synchronization and verification message

8. The NFS server on all cluster nodes must be restarted.
9. A new PowerHA resource group, SAP\_RG\_NFS , is created. The volume group vg\_TE1\_vg and the service IP label sapsmasvc2 are automatically added to the resource group as shown in Example 7-21.

Tip: The log file for the Smart Assist is in the /var/hacmp/log/sa.log file. Y ou can use the clmgr utility to easily view the log, as in the following example:

clmgr view log sa.log

When the PowerHA cluster starts, the DB2 instance is automatically started. The application monitors start after the defined stabilization interval as shown in Example 7-30.

Your SAP instance and DB2 database are now configured for high availability in a PowerHA SystemMirror configuration.

## 7.4  Scenario for a complete SAP and liveCache environment

We provide the scenario for a complete setup of the SAP and liveCache environment.

## 7.4.1 Overview

In this scenario, we want to illustrate the preferred environment setup for an SAP SCM/APO system that includes liveCache. This outlined solution exists within three separate clusters that accommodate each part of the entire solution. Through these separate individual components, the solution can be implemented, configured, and operated independently. A faster takeover is also a result of this implementation in the event of a node failure.

Tip: Consider the use of a virtual IP address for all SAP application server and instances to easily relocate them for maintenance and later SAP automation through SAP landscape virtualization manager (LVM).

The concept also provides two separate networks to isolate the communication between the server itself, and the normal communication between the clients and the servers. This concept also hides some parts of the cluster resources from the clients that are not necessary for the clients.

All needed users and groups have to be created with the same ID. To simplify the environment, all needed users and groups for the three-cluster solution are created on all six nodes. But for higher security, the users and groups must be created only on the systems where they are necessary.

Figure 7-35 is an overview of the components in this three-cluster solution.

Figure 7-35   Overview of the scenario for a complete three-cluster solution for SAP and liveCache

<!-- image -->

A second variant to this drafted solution is the local installation of an application server on every PowerHA node and to not illustrate only one primary application server inside the cluster that is taken over in a failure situation. The advantage of the solution is easier administration of only one instance inside the cluster. The disadvantage is the extended takeover time through the start of the primary application server on the backup node. This extended time influences the solution because the ABAP system, which is a double-stack SAP system, needs to start on the second node. Due to the JAVA stack, it needs a long time to be fully activated.

In both variants, we do not consider the additional application servers, which are necessary in a high availability concept. Because these application servers are installed outside the cluster on separate systems or LPARs, we do not describe them in this book. These servers can be installed as usual. In the cluster solution with Smart Assist for SAP , we do not describe the start or stop procedure of these additional application servers. This process must be manually performed outside the cluster.

## 7.4.2  Assignment of the three clusters

The clusters have the following assignments:

- Cluster 1: sapci\_cluster

In this cluster environment, the entire SAP instances are installed and controlled to enumerate an ASCS, an ERS, and a primary application server. This cluster houses an NFS service, which is a mandatory condition for the use of the Smart Assist for SAP . It uses only NFS version 4.

So that we do not have to set up an additional NFS server for the demonstration environment, the NFS server from the Smart Assist for SAP is also applied for the lock management of the hot-standby liveCache system. This approach is not usual and not required for a normal environment. It can differ from solution to solution. This part can also be handled by an external NFS service.

- Cluster 2: sapdb\_cluster

In this cluster, the database is deployed and the SAP system connects to sapcisvc4 . In the demonstration environment, one DB2 database is installed that uses shared disks between the cluster nodes for failover.

This solution is easy to implement and administer, but it is not optimized for fast takeover times. In a takeover, the remaining node needs time to recover.

If this solution does not meet your time constraints, a DB2 HADR solution is implemented in 7.8, 'DB2 HADR cluster solution' on page 463 that permits shorter takeover times. This alternative can be substituted for the cluster 2 solution, but it is not a Smart Assist solution. It uses the scripts that are implemented by the International SAP IBM Competence Center (ISICC) team. The scripts are described in the 'Cluster scripts for DB2 HADR' on page 645.

- Cluster 3: saplc\_cluster

This cluster implements a hot-standby liveCache solution. Therefore, two MaxDB databases with local not shared disks for the data area and concurrent shared disks for the log area are deployed. Both the data area and the log area have to stay on raw devices. This Smart Assist solution also implements an accelerated reestablishment of the standby functionality of the backup node. The data area of the backup node is cloned through IBM FlashCopy® from the active system if this reactivated system is not in synchronization with the running system.

In the demonstration environment, a DS8000 is selected. If you are interested in an implementation with the SAN Volume Controller and want more information, see PowerHA7.1.1\_HotStandbyImplementationPath\_v1.pub.pdf (version at press date), which is published by the ISICC:

http://w3-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/WP100677

## 7.4.3 Considerations and preconditions of this solution

The following considerations and prerequisites relate to implementing this solution:

- The use of the NFS service for the Smart Assist for SAP is required with this version of PowerHA. It prevents you from setting up a second cluster with Smart Assist in a three-system SAP landscape with development, quality assurance, and productive system, except that you use a remote transport system within SAP . The Smart Assist for SAP subtype NFS only supports NFS version 4.
- There is no Smart Assist implementation for DB2 HADR. However, the use of the solution without Smart Assist that is shown in 'DB2 HADR cluster solution' on page 463 is possible.
- A cluster with the liveCache hot-standby solution is only possible with the SAN Volume Controller, V7000, or DS8000 storage systems. The liveCache MaxDB can only use raw devices.

## 7.4.4  Installation path for the entire three-cluster environment

We describe the installation path for the entire three-cluster environment.

## Path for the installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist

Table 7-5 shows the path for installation and configuration steps for the Smart Assist. In this table, we show the best sequence/path to set up the whole three-cluster environment. The number behind the cross reference lists the step number inside the referenced chapter. We show with this table that some steps have to/must be done at the same time on both nodes in the three clusters and which steps have to follow each other.

## 7.5  Cluster 1: SAP Supply Chain Management

We provide an overview of the SAP Supply Chain Management (SCM) cluster 1.

## 7.5.1  Overview

This cluster uses the Smart Assist for SAP: GFS, SCS, ERS, and AS to make an SAP SCM system highly available. Figure 7-36 on page 395 presents the cluster solution.

## 7.5.2  Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for SAP

Cluster 1 in this complex environment uses the Smart Assist for SAP with subtypes GFS, SCS (in particular for ASCS), ERS, and AS (for primary application server instance). We explain the preliminary required steps before you start the Smart Assist for SAP . Then, we explain how to start the Smart Assist for SAP . Follow these steps:

1. Install the required filesets.

See 7.2.1, 'Installing the required PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist filesets' on page 362.

2. Configure the base IBM PowerHA SystemMirror.

You must configure the topology of the PowerHA cluster before you use the Smart Assist for SAP . Example 7-31 shows the cluster sapci\_cluster that is configured with two Ethernet interfaces in each node.

```
root@sapci1 / # lscluster -c Cluster query for cluster sapci_cluster returns: Cluster uuid: 62856a40-7209-11e1-81c5-2e4799b2bf6f Number of nodes in cluster = 2 Cluster id for node sapci1b1 is 1 Primary IP address for node sapci1b1 is 10.1.1.34 Cluster id for node sapci2b1 is 2 Primary IP address for node sapci2b1 is 10.1.1.27 Number of disks in cluster = 0
```

Example 7-31   Cluster network configuration

Multicast address for cluster is 228.1.1.24

## root@sapci1 / # cllsif

Adapter Type Network Net Type Attribute Node IP Address Hardware Address Interface Name Global Name Netmask Alias for HB Prefix Length sapci1b2 boot admin\_net  ether public sapci1 10.1.2.34 en1 255.255.255.0 24 sapci1b1 boot service\_net ether public sapci1 10.1.1.34 en0 255.255.254.0 23 sapci2b2 boot admin\_net ether public sapci2 10.1.2.27 en1 255.255.255.0 24 sapci2b1 boot service\_net ether public sapci2 10.1.1.27 en0 255.255.254.0 23

## 3. Configure the network.

The IP addresses for the NFS server ( sapcisvc2 ) and the SAP system ( sapcisvc1 ) are configured as an alias on the first network of the first node sapci1 where SAP AS and that primary application server are installed. The NFS service address, as shown in Example 7-32, is configured on a separated network also as an alias.

## 4. Create the users.

See 7.2.2, 'Creating the users' on page 362. The script to create the users is in the 'Script to create users and groups for sapci\_cluster, sapdb\_cluster, and saplc\_cluster' on page 604.

5. Create the volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems.

See 7.2.3, 'Creating volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems' on page 363 and validate them on both nodes. The scripts to create the volume groups and file systems are in 'Script to create VGs and LVs for sapci\_cluster' on page 606. See Example 7-34.

Prerequisite: /export/sapmnt/&lt; SID &gt; and /export/saptrans/&lt; SID &gt; are fixed naming conventions. Use these naming conventions because the Smart Assist can only find them by using these naming conventions.

TC1.lvdb2binary     jfs2 128 128 1    open/syncd    /db2/TC1

Directories: The directories /usr/sap and /db2 must be created locally as discrete file systems.

## 6. Configure NFS.

An NFS domain has to be configured on both nodes because the Smart Assist for SAP uses the NFS4 version.

root@sapci1 / # clcmd chnfsdom sapci\_cluster

Set these necessary settings for NFS Smart Assist:

- -stopsrc -s nfsd
- -startsrc -s nfsd
- -smitty nfsgrcperiod

Create a cluster exports file with the necessary mounts as shown in Figure 7-37 on page 398.

/export/sapmnt/TC1 -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapci1:sapci2:sapci1b2:sapci2b2: sapcisvc2:sapcisvc4:sapci1p2:sapci2p2 /export/saptrans/TC1 -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapci1:sapci2:sapci1b2:sapci2b2: sapcisvc2:sapcisvc4:sapci1p2:sapci2p2 /export/archive/TL1\_lock -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=saplc1:saplc2:saplc1b2:saplc2b2: saplcsvc1:saplcsvc2:saplc1p2:saplc2p2

Figure 7-37   cat /usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc/exports

## Copy this file to the second node:

root@sapci1 / # clrcp /usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc/exports sapci2:/usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc/exports

The NFS server exports all needed file systems as shown in Example 7-35.

Example 7-35   NFS server on sapci1

root@sapci1 / # exportfs -a root@sapci1 / # exportfs /export/sapmnt/TC1 -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapci1:sapci2:sapci1b2:sapci2b2:sap cisvc2:sapcisvc4:sapci1p2:sapci2p2 /export/saptrans/TC1 -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapci1:sapci2:sapci1b2:sapci2b2:sap cisvc2:sapcisvc4:sapci1p2:sapci2p2 /export/archive/TL1\_lock -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=saplc1:saplc2:saplc1b2:saplc2b2:sap lcsvc1:saplcsvc2:saplc1p2:saplc2p2

## Mount as the NFS client:

root@sapci1 / # mount -o vers=4,hard,intr sapcisvc2:/export/sapmnt/TC1 /sapmnt/TC1 root@sapci1 / # mount -o vers=4,hard,intr sapcisvc2:/export/saptrans/TC1 /usr/sap/trans

The following NFS client mounts are available as shown in Example 7-36.

## Example 7-36   NFS mounts on sapci1

root@sapci1 / # mount|grep nfs sapcisvc2 /export/sapmnt/TC1 /sapmnt/TC1      nfs4   Apr 05 06:44 vers=4,hard,intr sapcisvc2 /export/saptrans/TC1 /usr/sap/trans nfs4   Apr 05 06:45 vers=4,hard,intr

## 7. Install the SAP ASCS instance on the first node.

We installed SAP normally with a virtual SAP host name ( sapcisvc1 ). Only the normal SAP parameters are set as shown in Example 7-37 on page 399.

export TMPDIR=/tmp/TC1

mkdir

$TMPDIR

export JAVA\_HOME=/usr/java14\_64

./sapinst SAPINST\_USE\_HOSTNAME=sapcisvc1

Start the ASCS installation as shown in Figure 7-38. Select ASCS Instance .

Figure 7-38   SAPinst ASCS installation screen capture 1: Start installation

<!-- image -->

For a detailed view of the complete installation process, see 'sapci\_cluster: Installing the SAP ASCS instance on the first node' on page 609.

8. Install the SAP enqueue replication service instance on the second node.

For the ERS installation with SAPinst, a virtual SAP host name ( sapcisvc3 ) is also used. It is mandatory from SAP in case it is cluster controlled, but this situation is not the default for the Smart Assist for SAP . Therefore, we set up the ERS without a service IP .

The following SAP parameters are set as shown in Example 7-38.

```
export TMPDIR=/tmp/TC1 mkdir $TMPDIR export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java14_64 ./sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=sapcisvc3
```

Example 7-38   SAP sapinst environment parameters

Start the ERS installation as shown in Figure 7-39 on page 400. Select Enqueue Replication Server Instance .

Figure 7-39   SAPinst ERS installation screen capture 1: Start installation

<!-- image -->

For a detailed view of the complete installation process, see Appendix E: 'sapci\_cluster: Installing the SAP Enqueue Replication Service (ERS) instance on the second node' on page 623.

So that the Smart Assist for SAP later can identify this virtualized installation, we have to create links in the profile directory. This task is not necessary for the SAP functionality because the replicated enqueue is installed with a virtual IP address.

Important: The Smart Assist waits for profiles for the ERS with the host name at the end, not with a service address.

We create these links:

```
root@sapci1 / # cd /sapmnt/TC1/profile root@sapci1 /sapmnt/TC1/profile # ln -s START_ERS11_sapcisvc3 START_ERS11_sapci1 root@sapci1 /sapmnt/TC1/profile # ln -s START_ERS11_sapcisvc3 START_ERS11_sapci2 root@sapci1 /sapmnt/TC1/profile # ln -s TC1_ERS11_sapcisvc3 TC1_ERS11_sapci1 root@sapci1 /sapmnt/TC1/profile # ln -s TC1_ERS11_sapcisvc3 TC1_ERS11_sapci2
```

9. Install the SAP primary application server instance on the first node.

For the primary application server installation with sapinst , a virtual SAP host name ( sapcisvc4 ) is used. The following SAP parameters are set as shown in Example 7-39 on page 401.

export TMPDIR=/tmp/TC1

export JAVA\_HOME=/usr/java14\_64

mkdir $TMPDIR

./sapinst SAPINST\_USE\_HOSTNAME=sapcisvc4

Start the installation as shown in Figure 7-40. Select Central Instance .

Figure 7-40   SAPinst CI installation screen capture 1: Start installation

<!-- image -->

For a detailed view of the complete installation process, see 'sapci\_cluster: Installing the SAP central instance on the first node' on page 626.

10.Stop SAP on both nodes.

The SAP system has to be stopped before you import the volume groups on the node:

- -Stop SAP on node sapci1:
- root@sapci1 / # su - tc1adm
- sapci1:tc1adm 1&gt; stopsap sapcisvc1
- sapci1:tc1adm 1&gt; stopsap sapcisvc4
- -Stop SAP on node sapci2:
- root@sapci1 / # su - tc1adm
- sapci1:tc1adm 1&gt; stopsap sapcisvc3
- 11.Change the SAP profile parameter to meet the high availability needs.

Change the Start Option for the SAP enqueue server from 'Restart' to 'Start' as shown in Figure 7-41 on page 402.

```
[...] #-----------------------------------------------------------------------# Start SAP message server #-----------------------------------------------------------------------_MS = ms.sap$(SAPSYSTEMNAME)_$(INSTANCE_NAME) Execute_01 = local rm -f $(_MS) Execute_02 = local ln -s -f $(DIR_EXECUTABLE)/msg_server$(FT_EXE) $(_MS) Restart_Program_00 = local $(_MS) pf=$(_PF) #-----------------------------------------------------------------------# Start SAP enqueue server #-----------------------------------------------------------------------_EN = en.sap$(SAPSYSTEMNAME)_$(INSTANCE_NAME) Execute_03 = local rm -f $(_EN) Execute_04 = local ln -s -f $(DIR_EXECUTABLE)/enserver$(FT_EXE) $(_EN) Start_Program_01 = local $(_EN) pf=$(_PF) [...]
```

Figure 7-41   Edit /sapmnt/TC1/profile/START\_ASCS10\_sapcisvc1

Change the following parameters in the DEFAULT profile as shown in Figure 7-42.

```
[...] enque/deque_wait_answer = TRUE enque/con_retries = 120 ms/conn_timeout = 1800 [...]
```

Figure 7-42   Edit /sapmnt/TC1/profile/DEFAULT.PFL

Also, disable polling, enable all application servers for automatic reconnect, and enable ERS to be started for the correct ASCS instance. In some SAPinst versions, there are errors with these settings.

For more information, see these websites:

12.Update the /etc/services file on the secondary node.

See 7.2.4, 'Updating the /etc/services file on the secondary node' on page 363.

13.Copy and merge the directories.

For SAP to be started on the second cluster, you have to copy more files and directories manually to the other node. In the test environment, we copied several files and directories that are local on the first node to the second node:

root@sapci1 / # scp -pr /usr/sap/ccms/* sapci2:/usr/sap/ccms/

Important: The command clrcp works with files only not with directories.

The /usr/sap/sapservices file has to be merged between the two nodes because on the first node only entries for ASCS and DVEBMGS exist, and only entries for ERS exist on the second node.

Figure 7-43 shows the file /usr/sap/sapservices on node sapci1 before it is merged.

```
#!/bin/sh LIBPATH=/usr/sap/TC1/ASCS10/exe:$LIBPATH; export LIBPATH; /usr/sap/TC1/ASCS10/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/TC1/SYS/profile/START_ASCS10_sapcisvc1 -D -u tc1adm LIBPATH=/usr/sap/TC1/DVEBMGS12/exe:$LIBPATH; export LIBPATH; /usr/sap/TC1/DVEBMGS12/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/TC1/SYS/profile/START_DVEBMGS12_sapcisvc1 -D -u tc1adm
```

Important: If you try to configure this solution on a running cluster, configuration errors appear. The cluster synchronizes automatically and tries to start the new resource group, which results in errors when it is unmounted. To prevent these errors, you have to unmount everything manually before you press the Enter key in a running cluster or synchronize in a cluster in the INIT state.

A new PowerHA resource group, SAP\_RG\_NFS , is created. The volume group vg\_TE1\_vg and the service IP label sapcisvc2 are automatically added to the resource group as shown in Example 7-47.

2. Example 7-55 and Example 7-56 show the unmount of the NFS client file systems on both nodes, if mounted.

Example 7-55   Unmount NFS client file systems on sapci1

```
root@sapci1 / # umount /sapmnt/TC1 root@sapci1 / # umount /usr/sap/trans
```

Example 7-56   Unmount NFS client file systems on sapci2

root@sapci2 / # umount /sapmnt/TC1 root@sapci2 / # umount /usr/sap/trans

3. Unexport the NFS server directories. Check which directories are exported as shown in Example 7-57.

Example 7-57   Exported directories root@sapci1 / # exportfs

-vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapci1:sapci2:sapci1b2:sapci2b2:sap

/export/sapmnt/TC1

Your SAP instances are now configured for high availability in a hot-standby PowerHA SystemMirror configuration.

## 7.6  Cluster 2: Database instance

We describe the database instance in cluster 2.

## 7.6.1  Overview

This cluster uses the Smart Assist for SAP database instance (DB) to make a DB2 database highly available (Figure 7-81).

Figure 7-81   Schema overview for sapdb\_cluster

<!-- image -->

Figure 7-81 outlines the resource groups and network settings for this cluster.

## 7.6.2  Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for SAP

Cluster 2 uses the Smart Assist for SAP database instance (DB). Follow these steps:

1. Install the required filesets.
2. See 7.2.1, 'Installing the required PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist filesets' on page 362.
2. Configure the base IBM PowerHA SystemMirror.

You must configure the topology of the PowerHA cluster before you use the Smart Assist for SAP as shown in previous sections. Example 7-68 shows the cluster sapdb\_cluster that is configured with two Ethernet interfaces in each node.

```
root@sapdb1 / # lscluster -c Cluster query for cluster sapdb_cluster returns: Cluster uuid: 4bb355a6-720a-11e1-8613-6e8dddc6b66f Number of nodes in cluster = 2 Cluster id for node sapdb1b1 is 1 Primary IP address for node sapdb1b1 is 10.1.1.26 Cluster id for node sapdb2b1 is 2 Primary IP address for node sapdb2b1 is 10.1.1.42 Number of disks in cluster = 0 Multicast address for cluster is 228.1.1.23 root@sapdb1 / # cllsif Adapter Type Network Net Type Attribute Node IP Address Hardware Address Interface Name Global Name Netmask Alias for HB Prefix Length sapdb1b2 boot admin_net  ether public sapdb1 10.1.2.26 en1 255.255.255.0 24 sapdb1b1 boot service_net ether public sapdb1 10.1.1.26 en0 255.255.254.0 23 sapdb2b2 boot admin_net  ether public sapdb2 10.1.2.42 en1 255.255.255.0 24 sapdb2b1 boot service_net ether public sapdb2 10.1.1.42 en0 255.255.254.0 23
```

Example 7-68   Cluster network configuration

## 3. Configure network.

The IP addresses for the DB2 server ( sapdbsvc2 ) is configured on the first node sapdb1 where DB2 is installed (Example 7-69).

No additional IP address is configured on the second node sapdb2 .

4. Create the users.

See 7.2.2, 'Creating the users' on page 362 and the script to create the users in 'Script to create users and groups for sapci\_cluster, sapdb\_cluster, and saplc\_cluster' on page 604.

5. Create volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems as shown in Example 7-70 on page 433.

See 7.2.3, 'Creating volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems' on page 363, and the script to create the volume groups and file systems in 'Script to create VGs and LVs for sapdb\_cluster' on page 608.

6. Install the SAP database instance on the first node of this cluster.

We installed SAP normally with a virtual SAP host name. We set the usual SAP parameters only, as shown in Example 7-71.

Example 7-71   SAPinst environment parameters

```
export TMPDIR=/tmp/TE1 mkdir $TMPDIR export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java14_64 ./sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=sapdbsvc2
```

Start the database installation as shown in Figure 7-82. Select Database Instance .

Figure 7-82   SAPinst database installation screen capture 1: Start installation

<!-- image -->

For a detailed view, we documented the complete installation process in 'sapdb\_cluster: Installing the SAP database instance on the first node' on page 614.

Important: Smart Assist for DB2 supports only non-DPF and non-HADR DB2 databases.

7. Update the /etc/services file on the secondary node.

See 7.2.4, 'Updating the /etc/services file on the secondary node' on page 363.

8. Copy additional directories.
2. See 7.2.5, 'Copying more directories to the second node' on page 364.
9. Find the path for the binary files and then export the variable as shown in Example 7-72. The DSE\_INSTALL\_DIR environment variable is exported as the root user with the actual path for the DB2 binary files. If more than one DB2 version is installed, choose the version that you want to use for this highly available instance.

Example 7-72   Finding the DB2 binary files and exporting them root@sapdb1 / # /db2/TC1/db2tc1/db2\_software/bin/db2level DB21085I  Instance "db2tc1" uses "64" bits and DB2 code release "SQL09074" with level identifier "08050107". Informational tokens are "DB2 v9.7.0.4", "s110330", "IP23236", and Fix Pack "4". Product is installed at " /db2/TC1/db2tc1/db2\_software ".

root@sapdb1 / # export DSE\_INSTALL\_DIR=/db2/TC1/db2tc1/db2\_software

Important: The setting of this variable is mandatory. Without this seeded variable, the Smart Assist for SAP cannot find the appropriate database.

- 10.Check for the types that the Smart Assist for SAP can discover as shown in Example 7-73.

You can check the possible types on the command line. All types have a 1 at the end. The possible parameters for the cl\_sapdiscover command are -t GFS/AS/SCS/ERS/DB .

Example 7-73   Checking the Smart Assist for SAP discover function root@sapdb1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin/cl\_sapdiscover -t DB SAP Smart Assist:SAPNW\_7.0:5.SAP Database Instance:SAPNW\_7.0\_DBINSTANCE: 1

- 11.If an expected type is not found, more information can be collected by setting an additional environment variable as shown in Example 7-74.

Example 7-74   Setting enlarged output for cl\_sapdiscover

```
root@sapdb1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # export VERBOSE_LOGGING="high"
```

root@sapdb1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/sap/sbin # ./cl\_sapdiscover -t DB ...

## 12.PowerHA state

You can start the PowerHA Smart Assist in a running cluster or a cluster in the INIT state. Both nodes must be in the same state.

## 7.6.3 Starting Smart Assist for SAP: Database instance (DB)

After you complete the steps that are outlined in the previous sections, you are ready to start the Smart Assist for SAP as explained in the following steps:

You might also see the cluster verification message that is shown in Figure 7-89 on page 437.

```
... Importing volume group vg_TC1_sap to the following node(s):  sapdb2 sapdb2: 0516-783 importvg: This imported volume group is concurrent capable. sapdb2:         Therefore, the volume group must be varied on manually. sapdb2: 0516-1804 chvg: The quorum change takes effect immediately. sapdb2: Volume group vg_TC1_sap has been imported. Verification to be performed on the following: Cluster Topology Cluster Resources ...
```

Figure 7-89   Cluster verification message

The messages in Figure 7-89 explain that the volume group is automatically imported by the verification.

A new PowerHA resource group, db2tc1\_ResourceGroup , is created. The volume group vg\_TC1\_sap and the service IP label sapdbsvc2 are automatically added to the resource group as shown in Example 7-75.

```
root@sapdb1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/db2 # cllsgrp
```

Example 7-75   Configured resource group for the SAP DB2 instance

```
db2tc1_ResourceGroup root@sapdb1 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/db2 # cllsres APPLICATIONS="db2tc1_ApplicationServer" FILESYSTEM="" FORCED_VARYON="false" FSCHECK_TOOL="fsck" FS_BEFORE_IPADDR="false" RECOVERY_METHOD="parallel" SERVICE_LABEL="sapdbsvc2" SSA_DISK_FENCING="false" VG_AUTO_IMPORT="true" VOLUME_GROUP="vg_TC1_sap" USERDEFINED_RESOURCES=""
```

## 7.6.4  Completing the configuration

After the DB2 database is configured with the Smart Assist for SAP subtype DB, complete the configuration:

1. Stop the DB2 instance on the primary node if it is running, as shown in Example 7-76.
2. Unmount the shared file systems as shown in Example 7-77.

```
Example 7-76   Stopping the DB2 instance sapdb1:/ # su - db2tc1 sapdb1:/db2/db2tc1 # db2stop

## 7.7  Cluster 3: liveCache

This cluster makes an SAP MaxDB liveCache available as a hot standby. This book shows a solution with a DS8000 as the storage system. Inside the DS8000, a snapshot mechanism is available to create a fast backup of the HotStandby liveCache, if necessary.

More information about the SAP liveCache installation is in 'Invincible Supply Chain Implementation Guide for SAP HotStandby liveCache with PowerHA 7.1.1'. The file, PowerHA7.1.1\_HotStandbyImplementationPath\_v1.pub.pdf (version at press date), is on techdocs and is published by the International SAP IBM Competence Center (ISICC):

http://w3-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/WP100677

In this document, you can obtain the following information:

- Planning your liveCache installation
- Implementing a SAN Volume Controller-based solution instead of a DS8000-based solution
- Sizing, tuning, and administering your liveCache

## 7.7.1  Overview

This cluster uses the Smart Assist for MaxDB: liveCache to make a liveCache/MaxDB database highly available (Figure 7-92).

Figure 7-92   Schema overview of saplc\_cluster

<!-- image -->

Figure 7-92 shows the entire environment for the saplc\_cluster .

## 7.7.2  Prerequisites for the hot-standby liveCache Smart Assist

We show the prerequisites for the hot-standby liveCache Smart Assist:

- Executables directory /sapdb is a local directory or even better a local file system on both nodes.
- Data volumes for liveCache are local raw devices.

- Log volumes for liveCache are shared raw devices because both nodes need access to that data at the same time.
- The Smart Assist for MaxDB only discovers NPIV disks automatically. If vscsi is used, the manual steps are documented on techdocs.
- The naming conventions that are provided by the framework must not be changed.
- The amount and size of hdisks, logical volumes, and volume groups are limited (see also the techdocs document).
- The wizard only allows one Hardware Management Console (HMC) to access the storage system to be used during the automation. For redundancy, a second HMC can be manually added after the wizard is run.
- The liveCache version 7.7.07.39 or later is required.
- The wizard only functions in a two-node configuration.
- The automation works for SAN Volume Controller-based storage attachment through Secure Shell (ssh) and dscli for DS8000.
- A notification method must be included in the PowerHA application monitors.

## 7.7.3  PowerHA SystemMirror supported disk configurations

The PowerHA SystemMirror SAP liveCache HotStandby solution is tested for many disks, volume groups, and volumes. The configuration options that are shown in Table 7-7 are supported.

Table 7-7   PowerHA SystemMirror supported disk configuration

| Component                                                                                                 | Size         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Logical volume size                                                                                       | Up to 128 GB |
| Number of Disks/Volume Group                                                                              | Up to six    |
| Number of Volumes/Volume Group                                                                            | Up to 12     |
| Numberof Volume Groups in Log or Data Volume Groups that are activated between the Master and the Standby | Up to three  |

For any relevant limits on the disk and volume sizes that SAP advises, see the SAP documentation.

The SAP liveCache supports individual raw device sizes up to 128 GB. In the typical layout, a raw device is represented by a raw logical volume. Therefore, the physical disks can be greater than 128 GB and broken down into multiple logical volumes, not to exceed 12 logical volumes per volume group.

On the storage level only, one volume is supported by this version because no consistency group is created automatically on the DS8000 storage level.

## 7.7.4  Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for MaxDB

We show the installation and configuration steps before you use the Smart Assist for MaxDB:

1. Install the required filesets.

See 7.2.1, 'Installing the required PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist filesets' on page 362 for the additional file for Smart Assist for MaxDB.

2. Set the global required operating system (OS) and TCP/IP parameter.

On both nodes, set the following OS and TCP/IP parameters:

- -Operating system tuning

Increase the maximum number of processes to at least 2,000. Use the following operating system command:

chdev -l sys0 -a maxuproc='2000'

- -TCPIP tuning

To avoid batch jobs that stop as a result of the failover, the socket handling needs to be adjusted. The time until the connection is closed needs to be reduced on the liveCache LPARs and on all application servers that connect to the liveCache. The following suggestions must be validated against other prerequisites that might be set by applications that are not part of this book to ensure that there are no unexpected side effects. It is essential to make the changes permanent to span a reboot.

The following values are set:

```
no -p -o tcp_keepintvl=10 no -p -o tcp_keepidle=300 no -p -o tcp_keepinit=20
```

To make them permanent after the reboot, the -p (or -r ) flag is required.

- -Change root user limits

The same installation and configuration steps run as user root . Set the following soft and hard limits for CPU time, file size, data segment size, Receive Side Scaling (RSS) size, and stack size to unlimited for user root . Use the following command:

```
chuser fsize='-1' data='-1' stack='-1' rss='-1' cpu_hard='-1' fsize_hard='-1' data_hard='-1' stack_hard='-1' rss_hard='-1' root
```

## 3. Configure the base IBM PowerHA SystemMirror.

You must configure the topology of the PowerHA cluster before you use the Smart Assist for SAP . Example 7-81 shows the cluster saplc\_cluster that is configured with two Ethernet interfaces in each node.

```
root@saplc1 / # lscluster -c Cluster query for cluster saplc_cluster returns: Cluster uuid: c7843bf4-720b-11e1-b3ad-2e479785d36f Number of nodes in cluster = 2 Cluster id for node saplc1b1 is 1 Primary IP address for node saplc1b1 is 10.1.1.35 Cluster id for node saplc2b1 is 2 Primary IP address for node saplc2b1 is 10.1.1.43 Number of disks in cluster = 0 Multicast address for cluster is 228.1.1.25 root@saplc1 / # cllsif Adapter              Type       Network    Net Type   Attribute  Node       IP Address       Hardware Address Interface Name   Global Name      Netmask Alias for HB Prefix Length saplc1b2 boot admin_net  ether public saplc1 10.1.2.35 en1 255.255.255.0 24
```

Example 7-81   Cluster network configuration

saplc1b1 boot service\_net ether public saplc1 10.1.1.35 en0 255.255.254.0 23 saplc2b2 boot admin\_net  ether public saplc2 10.1.2.43 en1 255.255.255.0 24 saplc2b1 boot service\_net ether public saplc2 10.1.1.43 en0 255.255.254.0 23

4. Configure the network (Example 7-82).

The IP addresses for the SAP liveCache system ( saplcsvc1 ) are configured on the node where the SAP liveCache is installed.

5. Create the users and groups.

See 7.2.2, 'Creating the users' on page 362 and the script to create the users at 'Script to create users and groups for sapci\_cluster, sapdb\_cluster, and saplc\_cluster' on page 604.

The user account sdb must be locked. If not, the liveCache installation fails because this user account is checked:

chuser account\_locked=true sdb

6. Create the volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems.

See 7.2.3, 'Creating volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems' on page 363. Also, see the script to create the volume groups and file systems in the 'Script to create users and groups for sapsma\_cluster' on page 604.

The volume group vg\_TL1\_sdbdat is local on both nodes, and each node has the logical volumes for the liveCache data. The volume group vg\_TL1\_sdblog is shared between the two nodes, and each node has the logical volumes for the log volumes for the MaxDB logging. See Example 7-83.

7. Configure the NFS for the application state information.

Important: You can use every highly available NFS server for the directory service for the liveCache application state information. But in the demonstration environment, we used the NFS server from the sapci\_cluster as an NFS version 4 service because there is no external NFS server that is available in the demonstration environment.

An NFS domain must be configured on both nodes because we use the NFS server from the sapci\_cluster in the demonstration environment. Because the Smart Assist for SAP uses NFS version 4, we have to configure NFS version 4 and use the same NFS domain as the NFS cluster:

root@saplc1 / # clcmd chnfsdom sapci\_cluster

Set the necessary settings for NFS version 4:

stopsrc -g nfs smitty nfsgrcperiod startsrc -g nfs

Check whether the NFS server that we use from the sapci\_cluster exports all needed file systems as shown in Example 7-86 on page 446.

root@sapci1 / # exportfs /export/sapmnt/TC1 -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapci1:sapci2:sapci1b2:sapci2b2:sap cisvc2:sapcisvc4:sapci1p2:sapci2p2 /export/saptrans/TC1 -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sapci1:sapci2:sapci1b2:sapci2b2:sap cisvc2:sapcisvc4:sapci1p2:sapci2p2 /export/archive/TL1\_lock -vers=4,sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=saplc1:saplc2:saplc1b2:saplc2b2:sap lcsvc1:saplcsvc2:saplc1p2:saplc2p2

Mount as the NFS client on both nodes:

root@saplc1 / # mount -o vers=4,hard,intr sapcisvc2:/export/archive/TL1\_lock /archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK root@saplc2 / # mount -o vers=4,hard,intr sapcisvc2:/export/archive/TL1\_lock

/archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK

The following NFS client mounts must be available as shown in Example 7-87.

Example 7-87 NFS mounts on saplc1

root@saplc1 / # mount|grep nfs sapci1   /export/archive/TL1\_lock /archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK nfs4   Apr 12 03:49 vers=4,hard,intr

The easiest way to make this mount available after each reboot is to configure the automountd as shown in Example 7-88.

Example 7-88   Automounter config on saplc\_cluster

```
root@saplc1 / # cat /etc/auto* /- /etc/autofs_root.SAP -nobrowse #/sapmnt /etc/autofs_import.SAP -nobrowse /- /etc/autofs_root.SAP -nobrowse #/usr/sap/trans -fstype=nfs,timeo=1,retry=3,rw,hard,intr sapnfssvc1:/export/saptrans /archive/sapdb/TL1_LOCK -fstype=nfs,timeo=1,retry=3,rw,hard,intr,vers=4 sapcisvc2:/export/archive/TL1_lock
```

8. Set up the cluster state lock directory.

The configured directory /archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK in the previous section needs to be dedicated to this particular liveCache instance. The following users need to have read and write access:

- -root
- -sdb

These users can have read and write access by setting chmod 777 /archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK or by setting chown sdb:sdba /archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK .

The configured directory /archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK must be attached to both nodes as shown in the previous section and highly available.

The mount point of this directory (in our example, /archive/sapdb/TL1\_LOCK ) is one of the configuration parameters of the Smart Assist automation.

9. Install the SAP liveCache on the first node.

We performed a standard SAP installation. We set only the usual SAP parameters as shown in Example 7-89.

```
export TMPDIR=/tmp/TC1 mkdir $TMPDIR export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java14_64 ./sapinst
```

Example 7-89   SAP sapinst environment parameters

The SAPinst in the installation CD-ROM provides options when you create a liveCache instance. Important entries are highlighted along with the screen captures. It is possible to first install the MAXDB database, but the easier way is to let the SAPinst install it for you.

Start the liveCache installation as shown in Figure 7-93. Select liveCache Server Installation .

Figure 7-93   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 1: Start the database installation

<!-- image -->

The complete screen captures from the installation are in 'sapci\_cluster: Installing the SAP ASCS instance on the first node' on page 609.

10.Install the liveCache database executables on the second node.

In Example 7-90, the liveCache executables are installed from an image that is downloaded from the SAP marketplace by using the command-line installation SDBINST . The installation images in Example 7-90 run from a shared file system.

Use SAP SDBINST to install the liveCache software and select the option for Server + Client . In this example, we selected the dependent data path according to the SID that is selected for the liveCache instance that is being implemented: /sapdb/TL1 . The result is that all dependent data that is generated for the implementation is placed under the relevant SID in the /sapdb file system.

Example 7-90 liveCache executables installation on saplc2

- 11.Copy the additional directories.

So that the SAP liveCache can be started with the correct user environment on the second cluster node with user tl1adm , you have to copy additional files and directories manually to the other node:

```
root@saplc1 / # scp -pr /home/sdb/* saplc2:/home/sdb/ root@saplc1 / # scp -pr /home/sdb/.* saplc2:/home/sdb/
```

Important: The command clrcp works with files only, not directories.

12.Verify that the liveCache kernel versions on both nodes are the same.

## 7.7.5  Preliminary steps

We explain the required preliminary steps before you start the wizard and how to start the Smart Assist for SAP .

Before you start the Smart Assist for MaxDB, complete the following steps:

1. You can start the PowerHA SAP liveCache Hot Standby Wizard on a running cluster only.
2. The local file system /sapdb has to be online on both nodes. The shared volume groups for the liveCache logging have to be concurrent on both nodes saplc1 and saplc2 (Example 7-91). The local volume groups for the database data exist only on the primary node and have to be active there (Example 7-92 on page 452). On the backup node, no volume group for liveCache has to be configured.

Example 7-91   Activate concurrent volume group on both node saplc1 and node saplc2

varyonvg -c vg\_TL1\_sdblog

Example 7-92   Checking for active volume groups on node saplc1

3. The log and data volumes of a HotStandby liveCache are accessed as raw devices. Therefore, the liveCache user ( sdb ) must have the authority to access the devices at the raw level. Set the permissions for the liveCache raw devices to user sdb and group sdba . This step remains the same regardless of the liveCache SID and the administration user &lt; SID &gt;adm . Normally, the SAPinst set the permissions, but you have to check the permissions on the second node and maybe also if the wizard fails.

Example 7-94 on page 453 shows three logical volumes: two volumes for the log and one volume for the data. They are named lv\_TL1\_log1 , lv\_TL1\_log2 , and lv\_TL1\_data1 .

chown sdb.sdba /dev/rlv\_TL1\_log1

chown sdb.sdba /dev/rlv\_TL1\_log2

chown sdb.sdba /dev/rlv\_TL1\_data1

```
root@saplc1 / # ls -al /dev/rlv_* crw-rw----    1 sdb      sdba        101,  1 Apr 13 10:26 /dev/rlv_TL1_data1 crw-rw----    1 sdb      sdba        102,  1 Apr 13 10:26 /dev/rlv_TL1_log1 crw-rw----    1 sdb      sdba        102,  2 Apr 12 08:51 /dev/rlv_TL1_log2
```

Example 7-94   Raw logical volumes on saplc1

4. The MAXDB/liveCache database on the primary node has to be started as shown in Example 7-95.
5. Run the following command as user root and sdb on both nodes to prepare the database to connect to the SAPDB database:

```
root@saplc1 / # su - sdb $ /sapdb/programs/bin/dbmcli -d TL1 -u control,pw2201tc1 /sapdb/programs/bin/dbmcli on TL1>db_state OK State ONLINE ---
```

Example 7-95   Start liveCache database on the first node

/sapdb/programs/bin/xuser -U &lt; SID &gt;\_XUSER -u &lt; control &gt;,password -d &lt; SID &gt;

For our example, we used the following command:

/sapdb/programs/bin/xuser -U TL1\_XUSER -u control,pw2201tc1 -d TL1

6. Download and install the DS8000 dscli lppsource on both AIX nodes as described in the corresponding readme file. No further customization is necessary.

## 7.7.6  Starting SAP liveCache Hot Standby Wizard

After you complete the steps in the preceding sections, you are ready to start the SAP liveCache Hot Standby Configuration Wizard as explained in the following steps:

Alternatively, you can use the command line as shown in Example 7-96.

```
/usr/es/sbin/cluster/sa/hswizard/sbin/cl_hotstandby_createInstance \ -I'TL1' \ -D'TL1_XUSER' \ -t'DS8000' \ -H'9.12.6.17' \ -S'pw2201copy' \ -T'lunc0py' \ -F'/archive/sapdb/TL1_LOCK' \ -p'saplc1' \ -s'saplcsvc1' \
```

Example 7-96   liveCache wizard command line

```
-n'saplc1,saplc2' \ -l'vg_TL1_sdblog' \ -d'vg_TL1_sdbdat' \ -o'hdisk4-->hdisk4,hdisk5-->hdisk5'
```

Important: The SHMC password is inserted in a readable format, which you must remember if you provide information externally, such as smitty logs.

Example 7-97 shows the command output from the smitty panel.

## 7.7.8  Verifying the Smart Assist settings

We verify the Smart Assist settings. Follow these steps:

1. Verify whether the service address is configured on the correct network.
2. In some older versions, the Smart Assist configures a start after the resource group dependencies. Remove these dependencies because these dependencies disappeared in the actual versions.

Launch PowerHA by using the path for sapdbhr3 : smitty sysmirror  Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Configure Resource Group Run-Time Policies  Configure Dependencies between Resource Groups  Configure Start After Resource Group Dependency  Remove Start After Resource Group Dependency .

Select one of the dependencies. It does not matter which dependency because the second dependency must also be removed as shown in Figure 7-102 on page 461.

```
Select a Start After Resource Group Dependency to Remove Move cursor to desired item and press Enter. # Source                           Target RG_Master_TL1                     RG_Log_TL1 RG_Standby_TL1                    RG_Master_TL1
```

Figure 7-102   Select a Start After Resource Group Dependency to Remove

Or, you can use the command line as shown in Example 7-100.

Example 7-100   Command to remove a start after resource group dependency

```
/usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clrgdependency \ -t'START_AFTER' \ -d \ -c'RG_Standby_TL1' \ -p'RG_Master_TL1' /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clrgdependency \ -t'START_AFTER' \ -d \ -c'RG_Master_TL1' \ -p'RG_Log_TL1'
```

3. Verify or configure the resource group processing order (Figure 7-103).

Launch PowerHA by using the path for sapdbhr3 : smitty sysmirror  Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Configure Resource Group Run-Time Policies  Configure Resource Group Processing Ordering .

```
Change/Show Resource Group Processing Order Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes. [Entry Fields] Resource Groups Acquired in Parallel Serial Acquisition Order RG_Log_TL1 RG_Master_TL1 RG_Standby_TL1 New Serial Acquisition Order  [RG_Log_TL1 RG_Master_TL1 RG_Standby_TL1 ] + Resource Groups Released in Parallel Serial Release Order RG_Standby_TL1 RG_Master_TL1 RG_Log_TL1 New Serial Release Order [ RG_Standby_TL1 RG_Master_TL1 RG_Log_TL1 ] +
```

Figure 7-103   Change/Show Resource Group Processing Order

Or, you can use the command line as shown in Example 7-101 on page 462.

```
/usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clrgorder \ -c \ -a 'RG_Log_TL1 RG_Master_TL1 RG_Standby_TL1' \ -r 'RG_Standby_TL1 RG_Master_TL1 RG_Log_TL1'
```

Example 7-101   Command to change the resource group processing order

## 7.7.9  Completing the configuration

Tip: It is not necessary to stop the MaxDB liveCache environment. You can synchronize with a running database.

After the Smart Assist for MaxDB is configured, complete the configuration:

1. Synchronize the PowerHA cluster by using SMIT:
- a. Follow the path: smitty sysmirror  Custom Cluster Configuration  Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration (Advanced) .
- b. In the PowerHA SystemMirror Verification and Synchronization panel (Figure 7-104), press Enter to accept the default options.

```
PowerHA SystemMirror Verification and Synchronization (Active Cluster Nodes Exist) Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes. [Entry Fields] * Verify changes only?                               [No] + * Logging                                            [Standard] +
```

Figure 7-104   Accepting the default actions on the Verification and Synchronization panel

Tip: The log file for the liveCache Smart Assist for SAP is in the /var/hacmp/log/maxdbsa.log file. Y ou can use the clmgr utility to easily view the log as shown in the following example: clmgr view log maxdbsa.log

2. After the synchronization finishes, the resource groups are online. The application monitors start after the defined stabilization interval as shown in Example 7-102.

Your MaxDB instance and database are now configured for high availability in a hot-standby PowerHA SystemMirror configuration.

## 7.8  DB2 HADR cluster solution

This solution does not use the IBM PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist. Therefore, we need to use the script set from the ISICC team. This solution is an alternative solution for cluster 2 in the SAP liveCache scenario that is shown in 7.6, 'Cluster 2: Database instance' on page 431.

As described in the referenced 'Invincible SCM' paper, the value of 'back to production in 5 minutes' can be created on the base of End-to-End top to bottom HotStandby or active/passive solutions only.

Therefore, a solution for DB2 HADR is added, as well, to complete the stack.

## 7.8.1  Overview

We provide an overview of the solution (Figure 7-105 on page 464).

Figure 7-105   Schema overview for sapdbhr\_cluster

<!-- image -->

Figure 7-105 shows the DB2 HADR solution for this cluster sapdbhr .

## Cluster design

This DB2 HADR solution uses three resource groups:

- rg\_tc1\_db2hadr\_instance

This resource group starts the local DB2 instance. It is started on all available nodes. No IP address and no volume group are configured in this resource group. The necessary volume group(s) and file systems are activated automatically after the boot. It is monitored by the db2fm tool.

- rg\_tc1\_db2hadr\_primary

This resource group starts the database as the primary HADR instance. It is started on the first available node and has a service address for the connection of the external SAP always with the same IP address. It is monitored from the PowerHA cluster.

- rg\_tc1\_db2hadr\_standby

This resource group starts the database as the standby HADR instance. No additional resources are associated with this resource group. It is monitored from the PowerHA cluster. It is configured 'online on a different node' as second priority to the resource group rg\_tc1\_db2hadr\_primary .

All the scripts that are used are listed in 'Cluster scripts for DB2 HADR' on page 645.

## Startup

During startup, the cluster needs to be handled differently. If you bring up the pair, you have to ensure that the standby is started first and is in the peer state one time.

## Maintenance and application awareness

To not interfere with database administrative tasks, the logic is aware of the status (start/stop) to which the application is set by the database or SAP administrator for the following cases:

1. The administrator must use only one of the following commands:
2. -sapdbctrl start
3. -startdb
4. -sapdbctrl stop
5. -stopdb
6. -db2stop
7. -db2start
8. -db2gcf
9. -db2 activate
10. -db2fm
11. -db2 deactivate
2. The tool db2fm is enabled.
3. The flag 'APPLICATION\_INTEGRATION' in sapha\_SID.cfg is set to '1'.

Important: Never use the hadr commands in this PowerHA clustered environment to manually move, start, or stop. You must use the cluster tools to manually move, start, or stop.

## 7.8.2  Installation and configuration steps before you set up PowerHA

We describe the installation and configuration steps before we set up PowerHA. Follow these steps:

1. Request the latest set of scripts as described in 'Cluster scripts for DB2 HADR' on page 645. The only change is in the file sapha\_&lt; SID &gt;.cfg . Follow these steps:
- a. Rename the file sapha\_&lt; SID &gt;.cfg to include the SID that is used for the DB2 installation, in this case, TC1: sapha\_TC1.cfg .
- b. Open the file and adapt the names to your naming conventions. The details are in 'sapha\_TL1\_cfg' on page 669.
2. Create the users.
5. See 7.2.2, 'Creating the users' on page 362.
3. Create volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems (Example 7-103).

You must create the volume groups, logical volumes, and the file systems before you start the sapinst.

You can use the same command that is in 7.2.3, 'Creating volume groups, logical volumes, and file systems' on page 363, but you have to create the volume group on both nodes.

Example 7-103   Volume group at sapdbhr\_cluster

root@sapdbhr3 / # lsvg -l vg\_TC1\_sap

LV NAME             TYPE       LPs PPs PVs  LV STATE      MOUNT POINT

| TC1.lvdb2dat.04   | jfs2   |  140 |  140 |   1 | open/syncd   | /db2/TC1/sapdata4    |

4. Configure the network (Example 7-104).

This configuration is an alternate installation of cluster 2, but we use a separate IP configuration. The IP addresses for the DB2 server ( sapdbhrsvc2 ) are configured on the first node sapdbhr3 , where the DB2 primary is installed. But, we need this IP address for the communication between primary application server instance and the database only, not for the database.

No additional IP address is configured on the second node sapdbhr4 .

## 7.8.3  Installing the DB2 HADR database instance

There are two ways to install DB2 HADR:

- Use the SAPinst for the installation of the DB2 HADR database on the first node, as well as on the second node.
- Use the installation approach that is shown in 'sapdbhr\_cluster: Installing DB2 high availability disaster recovery' on page 640.

Node names must be the same: For this solution with the ISICC script set, the instances must have the same name on both nodes.

## 7.8.4  Configuring the DB2 fault monitor

The db2fm monitor needs to be started for our SAP DB2 instance on both nodes. The instance must not be started at boot time. The cluster starts the instance. Use these commands to start the db2fm monitor:

```
su - db2tc1 db2fm -i db2tc1 -f yes
```

You can check whether everything is correctly configured in the config file as shown in Example 7-105.

Path: The path /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib depends on the db2 installation.

Example 7-105   cat /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/fm.sapdbhr3.reg

```
sapdbhr3:db2tc1 14> cat /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/ fm.sapdbhr3.reg
```

```
FM_ON = yes # updated by db2fm FM_ACTIVE = yes # default START_TIMEOUT = 600 # default STOP_TIMEOUT = 600 # default STATUS_TIMEOUT = 20 # default STATUS_INTERVAL = 20 # default RESTART_RETRIES = 3 # default ACTION_RETRIES = 3 # default NOTIFY_ADDRESS = db2tc1@sapdbhr3 # default
```

Also, the db2fmc has to be configured to be started at every system boot as shown in Example 7-106.

Example 7-106   Configure and start db2fmc root@sapdbhr3 / # /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/bin/db2iauto -on db2tc1

root@sapdbhr3 / # /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/bin/db2fmcu -u -p /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/bin/db2fmcd root@sapdbhr3 / # /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/bin/db2greg -v -updinstrec instancename=db2tc1!startatboot=1

Service      = |N/A|

Version      = |N/A|

InstanceName = |db2tc1|

InstancePath = |N/A|

Usage        = |N/A|

StartAtBoot  = N/A

Maintenance  = N/A

InstallPath  = |N/A|

RemoteProf   = |N/A|

Comment      = |N/A|

Record to be updated to:

Service      = |DB2|

Version      = |9.7.0.4|

InstanceName = |db2tc1|

InstancePath = |/db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib|

StartAtBoot  = 1

Maintenance  = 0

InstallPath  = |/db2/TC1/db2tc1/db2\_software|

RemoteProf   = |N/A|

Comment      = |N/A|

Update record search criteria:

Review the db2greg.log file for more information.

Now, reboot the node and validate the correct functionality as shown in Example 7-107.

## Example 7-107   Verify db2fmc

```
root@sapdbhr3 /db2 # ps -ef|grep fm
```

```
db2tc1  8454248 10223760   0 15:00:27      -  0:00 db2fmp (C) 0 db2tc1  9568324        1   0 05:06:07      -  0:00 /db2/TC1/db2tc1/db2_software/bin/db2fmd -i db2tc1 -m /db2/TC1/db2tc1/db2_software/lib64/libdb2gcf.a root 15204466        1   0 05:06:07      -  0:00 /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/bin/db2fmcd
```

You have a new entry in /etc/inittab that the DB2 fault monitor coordinator is started after every system boot as shown in Example 7-108.

Example 7-108   lsitab fmc

```
root@sapdbhr3 /db2 # lsitab fmc fmc:2:respawn:/db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/bin/db2fmcd #DB2 Fault Monitor Coordinator
```

Validate the function of the DB2 fault monitor as shown in Example 7-109.

```
root@sapdbhr3 / # su - db2tc1 sapdbhr3:db2tc1 1> db2fm -i db2tc1 -s Gcf module '/db2/TC1/db2tc1/db2_software/lib64/libdb2gcf.a' state is AVAILABLE sapdbhr3:db2tc1 3> db2fm -i db2tc1 -S Gcf module 'fault monitor' state is AVAILABLE
```

Example 7-109   Validate DB2 fault monitor

```
Message: If the following message appears, it is also correct because the ' cl_db2_start_local ' script fixes this bug: " Gcf module ... is INSTALLED PROPERLY, BUT NOT ALIVE "
```

You must perform the same steps on the second node sapdbhr4 .

## 7.8.5  Configuring the base IBM PowerHA SystemMirror

At first, we configure the topology of the PowerHA cluster. In Example 7-110, the cluster sapdbhr\_cluster is configured with two Ethernet interfaces in each node.

```
root@sapdbhr3 /db2/TC1 # lscluster -c Cluster query for cluster sapdbhr_cluster returns: Cluster uuid: 49e85828-720c-11e1-98f2-6e8ddad91070 Number of nodes in cluster = 2 Cluster id for node sapdbhr3b1 is 1 Primary IP address for node sapdbhr3b1 is 10.1.1.28 Cluster id for node sapdbhr4b1 is 2 Primary IP address for node sapdbhr4b1 is 10.1.1.44 Number of disks in cluster = 0 Multicast address for cluster is 228.1.1.26 root@sapdbhr3 /db2/TC1 # cllsif Adapter Type Network Net Type Attribute Node IP Address Hardware Address Interface Name Global Name      Netmask          Alias for HB Prefix Length
```

Example 7-110   Cluster network configuration

```
sapdbhr3b2 boot admin_net  ether public sapdbhr3   10.1.2.28 en1 255.255.255.0 24 sapdbhr3b1 boot service_net ether public sapdbhr3   10.1.1.28 en0 255.255.254.0 23 sapdbhr4b2 boot admin_net  ether public sapdbhr4   10.1.2.44 en1 255.255.255.0 24 sapdbhr4b1 boot service_net ether public sapdbhr4   10.1.1.44 en0 255.255.254.0 23
```

Chapter 8.

## Workload partition and PowerHA scenario

This chapter describes scenarios that relate to workload partitions (WPARs) in an IBM PowerHA SystemMirror configuration for Standard Edition 7.1.1 for AIX.

This chapter presents the following sections:

- Introduction to WPARs
- Planning for high availability
- Support for a WPAR in PowerHA
- Scenario with a local WPAR
- SAP scenario on AIX 7.1 NFS WPAR
- NFS versioned 5.2 WPAR

## 8.1  Introduction to WPARs

Workload partitions (WPARs) are software-created virtualized operating system environments within a single instance of the AIX operating system. WPARs secure and isolate the environment for the processes and signals that are used by enterprise applications.

There are multiple WPARs types: Application WPARs or System WPARs. System WPARs are autonomous virtual system environments with their own private file systems, users and groups, login, network space, and administrative domain.

By default, a system WPAR shares the two file systems named /usr and /opt from the global environment by using read-only namefs mounts. You can configure WPARs to have a non-shared, writable /usr file system and /opt file system. The WPARs are also called private.

For more information about IBM AIX WPARs, see Exploiting IBM AIX Workload Partitions , SG24-7955.

In AIX Version 7, administrators now can create WPARs that can run AIX 5.2 inside an AIX 7 operating system instance. It is supported on the POWER7 server platform. PowerHA support is announced with the January 21, 2011 PowerHA Support Flashes for VIOS 2.2 and new Versioned 5.2 WPAR Support Flash.

For the announcement details, see the website:

http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/FLASH10737

Important: Versioned WPARs can be non-shared system WPARs only.

We describe three user scenarios: a scenario a local (namefs) WPAR, a scenario with an NFS shared WPAR, and a scenario with a versioned WPAR 5.2.

## 8.2  Planning for high availability

The WPAR offering is supported by IBM PowerHA SystemMirror since version 5.4.1. However, particularly in the planning phase, be careful because the combination of WPARs and PowerHA in an environment can potentially introduce new single points of failure (SPOFs).

PowerHA: PowerHA does not manage or monitor the WPAR. It manages and monitors only the applications that run within the WPAR.

## 8.2.1  General considerations

In PowerHA, you can have a mixture of normal resource groups and resource groups that run in a WPAR. Figure 8-1 on page 489 shows an example. In this example, we have two resource groups. One resource group runs in the Global AIX or Global WPAR environment. The second resource group runs inside a WPAR. Both resource groups have two defined application servers and an application monitor for each resource group.

Figure 8-1 PowerHA and WPAR basics

<!-- image -->

## 8.2.2 PowerHA and rootvg WPARs

A system WPAR, which is configured with its own dedicated root volume group, is called a rootvg WPAR. There are several restrictions for managing rootvg WPARs. Rootvg WPARs are not supported by PowerHA.

Important: PowerHA does not have integration support to manage rootvg WPARs, although it has integration support for system WPARs.

Configuring a rootvg WPAR by using one or more storage devices gives the WPAR administrator complete control of the storage devices that are exported to the WPAR, the volume groups on these devices, and the logical volumes and file systems within these volume groups. A system WPAR, which is not a rootvg WPAR, does not have its own root volume group. It has the same file system layout that is created in logical volumes, which are created externally in another place such as a Network File System (NFS) server (NFS WPARs) or on a volume group of the global system (local WPAR).

## 8.2.3 WPAR on local disk

This solution has a limited use. All data of the WPAR is on a local disk. This solution might be appropriate for any application that can use NFS or General Parallel File System (GPFS) shared file systems, for example, an application server.

If PowerHA creates the WPAR, this type of installation and configuration results. For more details, see 8.3.2, 'Creating a WPAR with the Resource Group menu' on page 494.

## 8.2.4  Planning for NFS-based file systems

We describe the necessary considerations when you plan to use NFS for your WPAR in your PowerHA cluster.

## Planning steps

In this section, we summarize the setup sequence and necessary planning:

1. Set up the NFS server.

We include the main items:

- -If you use a dedicated NFS server or network-attached storage (NAS) system, ensure that it has the same or better availability capabilities as your systems.
- -Remember to check whether you have enough disk space available on your NFS or NAS server.
- -Ensure that the root equivalency is defined. See Example 8-1 on page 491 for details.
- -Create the directory for your WPAR.
2. Configure the WPAR.

The file system for a WPAR is structured from a starting directory, for instance, /wpars/&lt; wpar\_name &gt; . This directory contains subdirectories for each private file system in the WPAR.

The starting directory of the WPAR must be created in the NFS server before the execution of the mkwpar command.

Important: The wpar\_name must equal the PowerHA resource group name that you plan to use.

For an NFS-based WPAR, each file system must be specified at creation time. These file systems include / , /home , /var/hacmp/adm , /var , and, optionally, /usr and /opt for a private system WPAR.

For an example, see 'Defining WPAR' on page 491.

3. Configure PowerHA.

## NFS setup

For an NFS-based WPAR in an PowerHA environment, each node in the cluster must have root access to the NFS shared file systems that contain the WPAR data. Example 8-1 on page 491 shows how the entry in the /etc/exports might look. In this example, the PowerHA cluster nodes are sys5lpar3 and sys5lpar4 . The NFS server is a third system (not part of the cluster).

```
cat /etc/exports /wpars -sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw,root=sys5lpar3:sys5lpar4 #
```

Example 8-1   Content of /etc/exports on a dedicated NFS server

Before you can create your WPAR, you have to check that you created the main WPAR directory in your NFS server. In our example, it is named testwpar . So we performed a mkdir testwpar . Then, we used the command that is shown in Example 8-2.

## Defining WPAR

For an NFS-based WPAR, each file system must be specified at creation time. These file systems include / , /home , /var/hacmp/adm , /var , and, optionally, /usr and /opt for a private system WPAR.

## Example 8-2   Create a WPAR on the first node

```
# mkwpar -r -a -N address=10.12.154.175 -n testwpar -h testwpar \ > -M directory=/ vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/ \ > -M directory=/var vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/var \ > -M directory=/var/hacmp/adm vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/var/hacmp/adm \ > -M directory=/home vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/home #
```

When the WPAR is created on the first node, you can define it on the next node or nodes by adding the -p option to the command that is used in Example 8-2. If you forget the -p option, you get an error message. Example 8-3 shows the command that we used.

## Example 8-3   Create a WPAR on the second node

```
# mkwpar -r -a -p -N address=10.12.154.175 -n testwpar -h testwpar > -M directory=/ vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/ \ > -M directory=/var vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/var \ > -M directory=/var/hacmp/adm vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/var/hacmp/adm \ > -M directory=/home vfs=nfs host=hg5lpar1 dev=/wpars/testwpar/home #
```

\

## Configuring the resource group in PowerHA

The important part here is that you check the WPAR name is the same as the resource name, and these two are equal to the name you decided to use in the 'NFS setup' on page 490.

Example 8-4 shows the important fields in the Change/Show window for resource groups (Example 8-4). The full listing is in Example F-1 on page 700.

```

## 8.2.5  Planning for a versioned WPAR

The goal is to run an existing AIX 5.2 environment with a small application within a versioned WPAR 5.2 and to describe how the PowerHA configuration allows a failover transaction. Running an existing AIX 5.2 environment inside of an AIX 7 operating system instance requires the use of a versioned WPAR 5.2. It is supported on the POWER7 server platform.

A versioned WPAR provides a different version of the runtime environment than the global system. Support for AIX 5.2 or AIX 5.3 versioned WPARs requires the installation of more licensed program products:

- AIX 5.2 WPARs for AIX 7
- AIX 5.3 WPARs for AIX 7

A mksysb backup of a system that runs an earlier version of AIX is used to create the versioned WPAR. Applications that run in a versioned WPAR use the commands and libraries from the operating system files where the backup is made to create the versioned WPAR, for example, AIX 5.2 or AIX 5.3. These versioned WPARs own writable /opt and /usr file systems. Applications that run in the versioned WPAR do not need to know that the global system has a different version of the AIX operating system.

## Requirements for versioned WPARs

The following requirements are necessary to create a versioned WPAR:

- POWER7 hardware.
- The minimum level of AIX 5.2 that can be used within a versioned AIX 5.2 WPAR is AIX 5.2 with Technology Level (TL) 10 and Service Pack (SP) 8. Therefore, any backup image that is used to create an AIX 5.2 WPAR must be from an AIX 5.2 system that runs the latest version.
- The minimum level of AIX 5.3 that can be used within a versioned AIX 5.3 WPAR is AIX 5.3 with TL 12. Therefore, any backup image that is used to create an AIX 5.3 WPAR must be from an AIX 5.3 system that runs TL 12 or later.

## Installing support for a versioned WPAR

The versioned WPAR product that is associated with the level of AIX WPAR to be created must be installed on the system.

The product media contains the required installation images that are called vwpar.images to support the creation of versioned WPARs. The product media contains optional software that provides System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) support to create and manage versioned WPARs.

## Creating a versioned WPAR

You can create a new versioned WPAR with the mkwpar command, the smitty interface, or the System Director plug-in for WPAR.

Each WPAR has an isolated network environment with unique IP addresses and a unique host name. You can access WPARs through standard networking programs, such as telnet, FTP, and rlogin.

The following example shows the command-line command to create the WPAR:

mkwpar -n WPARname -C -B /mksysb\_images/backupname

The command creates the WPAR according to your backup. The initial output of the mkwpar command looks similar to the following example:

```
mkwpar: Extracting file system information from backup... mkwpar: Creating file systems... Creating file system '/' specified in image.data /bff Creating file system '/bff' specified in image.data /home Creating file system '/home' specified in image.data
```

## 8.3  Support for a WPAR in PowerHA

The current support of WPAR in PowerHA is oriented toward the basic WPARs:

- Currently, support is available for local ( namefs file systems) and NFS WPARs only. WPARs can be shared or private. Versioned WPARs are also supported.
- When a WPAR-enabled resource group (RG) is brought online, all its associated resources are activated within the corresponding WPAR. The WPAR-enabled RG is associated with a WPAR based on their common name. If a resource group called wpar\_rg is WPAR-enabled, it is associated with a WPAR with the name wpar\_rg .
- When an RG is WPAR-enabled, all user scripts, such as application start and stop scripts must be accessible within the WPAR, at the paths that are specified in the PowerHA configuration. It is the responsibility of the user to verify that these scripts are executable and return 0 .
- A WPAR-enabled RG can consist of some nodes that are not WPAR capable so you do not need to upgrade all nodes of the RG to the latest AIX operating system version. And when a WPAR-enabled RG comes online on a WPAR-incapable node, it behaves as if the WPAR property for the RG is not set. However, you must ensure that all user-defined scripts are accessible at the same path as previously specified in the PowerHA configuration.

- A WPAR-enabled RG supports the following resources: service label, application servers, and file systems. The service address is mandatory. The service address is allocated to the WPAR when PowerHA starts the RG.
- When a WPAR-enabled RG is deleted, the corresponding WPAR on the nodes of the RG are unaffected (that is, the corresponding WPAR is not deleted).
- All the supported resource types that are supported for a WPAR-enabled RG can be DARE added and removed from a WPAR-enabled RG. If the WPAR property of an RG is changed through DARE (when the RG is online), the effect takes place when the RG is brought online the next time.
- PowerHA configuration verification checks that all WPAR-capable nodes of a WPAR-enabled RG have a WPAR that is configured for the RG (that is, a WPAR with the same name as the RG). If the PowerHA configuration verification is run with corrective action enabled, you are prompted to fix the WPAR-related verification errors through PowerHA corrective action. It might mean the creation of a local WPAR on all nodes that are specified in the RG modification menu.
- When a WPAR-enabled RG is brought online on a WPAR-capable node, PowerHA (which runs in the global WPAR) automatically sets up rsh access to the corresponding WPAR to manage various resources that are associated with the RG.

Important: PowerHA automatically assigns and unassigns resources to and from a WPAR as the corresponding WPAR-enabled resources come online (or go offline). You must not assign any PowerHA resources to a WPAR.

## Considerations

Consider the following important information:

- PowerHA Smart Assist scripts are not supported for a WPAR-enabled RG. Therefore, any application server or application monitoring script that uses the PowerHA Smart Assist scripts cannot be configured as a part of a WPAR-enabled RG.
- Process application monitoring is not supported for WPAR-enabled RGs.
- For every WPAR-capable node that is a part of a WPAR-enabled RG and contains a WPAR for a WPAR-enabled RG, at least one of the service labels (of the WPAR-enabled RG) must be accessible from the corresponding global WPAR.

Important: Only the Global instance can run PowerHA. A WPAR can be considered an RG of the type WPAR-enabled RG only.

## 8.3.1  Creating a WPAR before you define a Resource Group

We highly advise that you create your WPAR before you add it to an RG in PowerHA.

## 8.3.2  Creating a WPAR with the Resource Group menu

To create an RG, you enter this command: smit hacmp . Select Cluster Applications and Resources  Resource Groups  Add a Resource Group . Or, use the fast path: smitty cm\_add\_resource\_group .

The Add a Resource Group panel opens as shown in Figure 8-2 on page 495. Use this menu to specify the RG name and the startup and stop script full path that is available in the Global instance.

Figure 8-2   Adding an RG

<!-- image -->

The WPAR-enable specification is added through the Change/Show resources and Attributes for a Resource Group menu. After you specify the application name that is entered in the Resource Group menu, you are shown a complete menu to specify the nodes, service address, and WPAR name specification. In our example, we specified a two-node list wpar1 and wpar2 , a service IP address as wpar1sap , a set of scripts that is part of the application controller group ApplA , and the WPAR named ApplA .

Figure 8-3   Adding a WPAR-enabled RG

Important: If the WPAR name does not exist when you synchronize the configuration, you are asked to correct the error and the system creates a simple WPAR by using the command mkwpar -n WPAR-name on the specified node. The service address is attached to the WPAR when the RG is brought online.

If the WPAR name did not exist or you have a typo in the WPAR Name field, the WPAR is defined on the rootvg on all nodes that are part of this RG. See Example 8-5 on page 497.

Next, we describe the WPAR scenario example.

## 8.4  Scenario with a local WPAR

Creating a local WPAR does not allow migration nor duplication. However, you can create the same WPAR on two nodes that use a shared disk. We describe this scenario, which is represented by Figure 8-4 on page 498.

Figure 8-4   Overview of the local (namefs) WPAR environment

<!-- image -->

Requirement: It requires some AIX admin knowledge as well as some WPAR knowledge.

## 8.4.1 Creating a local WPAR on two nodes

The first creation of a local WPAR that uses a local shared disk is described as a reference but it is supposed to be known. It requires a volume group on the shared disk and an address for the WPAR ( 10.1.1.50 as shown in Example 8-7).

```
#Create the concurrent capable volume group exportvg haapvg mkvg -f -S -y haapvg -V 111 -C -n hdisk7 varyonvg haapvg
```

Example 8-7   Creation of a local WPAR on a shared volume group

- # Create the standalone wpar on volume haapvg with address 10.1.1.50
- # and name ApplA

```
mkwpar -n ApplA -g haapvg -a -F -N address=10.1.1.50 mkwpar: Creating file systems... / /home /opt /proc /var/hacmp/adm /usr /var Mounting all workload partition file systems. x ./usr x ./lib x ........... Workload partition ApplA created successfully. mkwpar: 0960-390 To start the workload partition, execute the following as root: startwpar [-v] ApplA # Change lv names for further processing lsvg -l haapvg /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1' fslv00 /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1_home' fslv01 /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1_var/hacmp/adm' fslv02 /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1_var' fslv03 # Ensure wpar is able to start startwpar ApplA
```

The WPAR is started and functional. We can create a specfile configuration file to use on the other node (Example 8-8).

Example 8-8   Creation of a specfile

```
mkwpar -w -e ApplA -o ApplA.spec
```

We need to vary off the volume group for the other node to use it and create the WPAR again as though it is new (Example 8-9).

Example 8-9   Moving the volume to the other node

varyoffvg haapvg

```
# GOTO WPAR2 lspv importvg -y haapvg -V 111 hdisk1 varyonvg haapvg root@wpar2 / # lsvg -l haapvg haapvg: LV NAME TYPE LPs     PPs     PVs  LV STATE      MOUNT POINT wrg1 jfs2 12      12      1    closed/syncd  /wpars/ApplA wrg1_home jfs2 4       4       1    closed/syncd  /wpars/ApplA/home wrg1_var/hacmp/adm jfs2 12      12      1    closed/syncd /wpars/ApplA/var/hacmp/adm wrg1_var jfs2 16      16      1    closed/syncd  /wpars/ApplA/var
```

The volume is imported and the /etc/filesystems (Example 8-10) is populated with entries for the WPAR, but the WPAR does not exist. You need to remove the entries as shown in Example 8-10.

```
rmfs /dev/wrg1
```

Example 8-10   Removing the file systems that are imported

```
rmfs /dev/wrg1_home rmfs /dev/wrg1_var/hacmp/adm rmfs /dev/wrg1_var
```

Remove the /wpar/ApplA directory. Y ou can create the WPAR again from the beginning by using the mkwpar -f ApplA.spec command (Example 8-11).

```
# mkwpar -f ApplA.cfg mkwpar: Creating file systems... / /home /opt /proc /var/hacmp/adm /usr /var ...... Workload partition ApplA created successfully. mkwpar: 0960-390 To start the workload partition, execute the following as root: startwpar [-v] ApplA
```

Example 8-11 Creating the WPAR again by using a specfile

Create the file systems again as seen in the initial node by using chlv as shown in Example 8-12.

```
# Change the lv name to match initial node specification
```

Example 8-12   lsvg of the volume haapvg

```
lsvg -l haapvg /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1' fslv00 /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1_home' fslv02 /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1_var/hacmp/adm' fslv03 /usr/sbin/chlv -n'wrg1_var' fslv04
```

The WPAR is created again on node wpar2 , and it can be started. To start the WPAR on node wpar1 , vary the volume offline and vary the volume online.

The WPAR is defined on both nodes and can be started on the node where the volume haagvg is active.

Administrator: Any modification to the configuration of the WPAR must be propagated to the other node. Any modification that uses the chwpar command must be issued on the two nodes.

We can configure the cluster.

## 8.4.2 Configuring PowerHA

For details to create a simple cluster, see Chapter 3, 'PowerHA 7.1.1 basic installation and configuration' on page 73.

All commands can be issued by using tools, such as smit , clmgr on the command line, or the System Director plug-in. In some cases, where you can use the command line, it is listed.

We create a simple cluster with two nodes, one repository disk, and we create the appropriate RG for PowerHA functionality with the WPAR.

The following steps are listed for reference:

1. Set the routing table and persistent addresses on your systems.
2. Update /etc/cluster/rhosts with the two host names, wpar1 and wpar2 , and all service, persistent, and base addresses. Ensure that /usr/es/sbin/cluster/etc/hosts matches /etc/cluster/rhosts .
3. Create the cluster by using the smit cm\_setup\_cluster\_nodes\_networks fastpath or the clmgr add cluster command. For example, create the cluster wpar1\_cluster with the two nodes, wpar1 and wpar2 .
4. Add the repository disk and the multicast address by using clmgr modify cluster or the smitty cm\_define\_repos\_ip\_addr fast path. In our example, we add hdisk2 and 228.1.1.29 .
5. Check the addresses by using /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/cllsif .
6. Add the persistent addresses for the nodes and the applications by using the smit panel cm\_add\_interfaces .
7. Check the topology by using cltopinfo as shown in Example 8-13.

```
root@wpar1 / # cltopinfo Cluster Name: wpar1_cluster Cluster Connection Authentication Mode: Standard Cluster Message Authentication Mode: None Cluster Message Encryption: None Use Persistent Labels for Communication: No Repository Disk: hdisk2 Cluster IP Address: 228.1.1.29 There are 2 node(s) and 2 network(s) defined NODE wpar1: Network net_ether_01 wparsvc1        172.16.21.63 wpar1p1 172.16.21.37 wpar1   10.1.1.37 Network net_ether_02 wpar1b2 10.1.2.37 NODE wpar2: Network net_ether_01 wparsvc1        172.16.21.63 wpar2p1 172.16.21.45 wpar2   10.1.1.45 Network net_ether_02
```

Example 8-13   Simple cluster topology output

8. Verify and synchronize the cluster configuration.
9. Check the CAA cluster by using the lscluster commands as shown in Example 8-14.

```
root@wpar1 / # lscluster -d Storage Interface Query Cluster Name:  wpar1_cluster Cluster uuid:  41320306-7aa8-11e1-96d5-2e4791550c6f Number of nodes reporting = 2 Number of nodes expected = 2 Node wpar1 Node uuid = 40f2ab20-7aa8-11e1-96d5-2e4791550c6f Number of disk discovered = 1 hdisk2 state : UP uDid  : uUid  : a6a85ae8-1e89-8ab5-bafc-5a27dc82aa5a type  : REPDISK Node wpar2 Node uuid = 412cbb4e-7aa8-11e1-96d5-2e4791550c6f Number of disk discovered = 1 hdisk2 state : UP uDid  : uUid  : a6a85ae8-1e89-8ab5-bafc-5a27dc82aa5a type  : REPDISK root@wpar1 / # lscluster -m Calling node query for all nodes Node query number of nodes examined: 2 Node name: wpar1 Cluster shorthand id for node: 1 uuid for node: 40f2ab20-7aa8-11e1-96d5-2e4791550c6f State of node:  UP  NODE_LOCAL Smoothed rtt to node: 0 Mean Deviation in network rtt to node: 0 Number of zones this node is a member in: 0 Number of clusters node is a member in: 1 CLUSTER NAME       TYPE  SHID   UUID wpar1_cluster      local        41320306-7aa8-11e1-96d5-2e4791550c6f Number of points_of_contact for node: 0 Point-of-contact interface & contact state n/a ------------------------------Node name: wpar2 Cluster shorthand id for node: 2 uuid for node: 412cbb4e-7aa8-11e1-96d5-2e4791550c6f State of node:  UP Smoothed rtt to node: 7 Mean Deviation in network rtt to node: 3
```

Example 8-14   lscluster output

```

```

10.Create the ApplA application controller scripts by using cm\_add\_app\_scripts and ensure that they are executable on both nodes. Examples of these scripts are shown in Example 8-15.

```
# cat /usr/local/ha/StartA #!/usr/bin/ksh # [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x # Name=$(basename $0 ) if [ "$Name" = "StartA" ] then echo "$(date) \"Application A started\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log touch /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup nohup /usr/local/bin/ApplA & exit 0 elif [ "$Name" = "StopA" ] then rm -f /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup echo "$(date) \"Application A stopped\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 0 else echo "$(date) \"ERROR - Application A start/stop script called with wrong name\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 999 fi #---------------------------------------------------# # cat /usr/local/ha/StopA #!/usr/bin/ksh # [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x # Name=$(basename $0 ) if [ "$Name" = "StartA" ] then echo "$(date) \"Application A started\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log touch /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup nohup /usr/local/bin/ApplA & exit 0 elif [ "$Name" = "StopA" ]
```

Example 8-15   Sample scripts to start and stop the RG ApplA

```
then rm -f /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup echo "$(date) \"Application A stopped\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 0 else echo "$(date) \"ERROR - Application A start/stop script called with wrong name\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 1 fi
```

- 11.Create the application monitor by using the Add Custom Application Monitor menu (Figure 8-5). The cm\_cfg\_custom\_appmon command is the command-line command that brings up the menu that is shown in Figure 8-5. In our example, we add a script that is called MonA as shown in Example 8-16.

```
> cat /usr/local/ha/MonA #!/usr/bin/ksh # [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x # if ( $(ps -ef | grep -w ApplA | grep -vq grep) ) then echo "MON:ApplA is running on $(uname -n)\n" >>/var/hacmp/adm/mon.log exit 0 else echo "MON:ApplA is NOT running on $(uname -n)\n" >>/var/hacmp/adm/mon.log exit 1 fi
```

- 12.Add the application controller scripts (scripts for starting and stopping the WPAR) by using the cm\_add\_app\_scripts smit command, and the menu is shown in Figure 8-6. Perform a quick check by using the cllsserv command.
- 13.Add a service label for the WPAR address 10.1.1.50 by using the command line or the smit cm\_add\_a\_service\_ip\_label\_address.select\_net (Example 8-17).
- 14.Add the RG ApplA by using smit cm\_add\_resource\_group . The output can be checked with the cltopinfo command as shown in Example 8-18.

## 8.5  SAP scenario on AIX 7.1 NFS WPAR

We describe the use of the SAP environment as installed in Chapter 7, 'IBM PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for SAP' on page 355 within a WPAR.

That scenario illustrates the following information:

- NFS WPARs overview
- Specific commands to fit the SAP environment
- SAP installation

## 8.5.1 NFS WPARs overview

An NFS system WPAR, which is configured with its own file systems, is on one or more dedicated shared storage devices. A set of file systems that represents a rootvg volume must be created on the NFS server. More file systems can be added later.

Figure 8-11 shows the network configuration that includes the WPAR.

## 8.5.2 Specific commands to fit the SAP environment

Because we created the SAP environment on another cluster and we are cloning the environment, we have to consider a few areas to get our WPAR ready:

- Consider a shared or non-shared (private) WPAR
- Create a writable directory under a shared directory
- Make links
- Allocate addresses

## Consider a shared or non-shared (private) WPAR

By default, a system WPAR shares the /usr file system and the /opt file system from the global environment by using read-only namefs mounts. You can configure WPARs to have a non-shared, writable /usr file system and /opt file system.

In our SAP scenario (typical installation), we run multiple specific file systems that are named and mounted as shown in Example 8-20.

Example 8-20   Set of file systems to be mounted within WPAR

The /usr and /opt file systems can be shared with the Global environment.

## Make links

For our scenario, we need to create the /usr/sap directory under the Global environment. This /usr/snap directory is seen within the WPAR and can be overmounted within the WPAR.

Administrator: File systems must be created correctly for the /etc/filesystem file to mount them in the correct order because multiple file system overmount themselves.

## Allocate addresses

The WPAR service address that is allocated to our network address, for example, 172.16.21.63 , is named wparsvc1 in /etc/hosts . There is no need to create another specific address for the WPAR. The PowerHA environment uses its own set of addresses as explained in 3.5, 'Networking' on page 83.

## 8.5.3 SAP installation

The SAP installation process is described at a high level in Chapter 7, 'IBM PowerHA SystemMirror Smart Assist for SAP' on page 355.

In our scenario, we use the file systems that we created during that process and included them in a WPAR. So, we describe only the mandatory steps to make SAP work within the WPAR.

## Configuring I/O completion ports (IOCP) within the Global instance

Use the smit iocp fastpath from the Global instance to enable IOCP .

## Creating the WPAR

The WPAR creation is issued with the NFS disk by using the following specifications:

- Own service address of 172.16.21.63
- Named wpar1svc1 to match /etc/host entry for address 172.16.21.63

The command line to create the WPAR is shown in Example 8-21. It also can be created by using the smit wpar fast path.

Example 8-21   Simple SAP NFS WPAR creation

#!/usr/bin/ksh

WPARNAME=wparsvc1

addr=172.16.21.63

NFSHOST=172.16.21.65

NFSROOT=/install/wpar/wpars

# Mount the shared file system  located on NFS server as local mount $NFSHOST:/install  /install LNFSROOT=$NFSROOT

echo Creating wpar $WPARNAME with address $addr on server $NFSHOST in $NFSROOT

mkdir -p $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME || error chmod +x $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME

mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var/hacmp/adm mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var

mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/home mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr

mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/opt mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr/sap

mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/export mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/db2

#!/usr/bin/ksh WPARNAME=wparsvc1 addr=172.16.21.63 NFSHOST=172.16.21.65 NFSROOT=/install/wpar/wpars

# Mount the shared file system  located on NFS server as local mount $NFSHOST:/install  /install LNFSROOT=$NFSROOT

```
echo Creating wpar $WPARNAME with address $addr on server $NFSHOST in $NFSROOT mkdir -p $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME || error chmod +x $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var/hacmp/adm mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/home mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/opt mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr/sap mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/db2 mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/export mkwpar -F -l  -r -N address=$addr interface=en0 interface=en0 -n $WPARNAME \ -M directory=/ vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/  \ -M directory=/var vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var  \ -M directory=/var/hacmp/adm vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var/hacmp/adm  \ -M directory=/home vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/home  \ -M directory=/usr vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr  \ -M directory=/opt vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/opt \ -M directory=/usr/sap vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr/sap  \ -M directory=/db2 vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/db2 \ -M directory=/export vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/export
```

When the WPAR is created, you can use the lswpar command to check for the disk and the main parameters as shown in Example 8-22.

Example 8-22   Main lswpar command that is used to check creation

Auto:

no

Private /usr:            no

Checkpointable:          no

Application:

OStype:                  0

UUID:

68f2fcdc-ca7e-4835-b9e1-9edaa2a36dcd

## Steps to configure the SAP within the WPAR

Follow these steps to configure SAP within a WPAR:

1. Create the proper user as seen in the SAP reference system. Example 8-23 on page 515 shows the full script to create users for SAP:
2. -sapsr3

- in /usr/sap/TE1/home/sapsr3

- -sapadm - in /usr/sap/TE1/homesapadm
- -db2te1 - in

/db2/db2te1

- -da1adm - in

/usr/sap/TE1/home/da1adm

- -te1adm is created by the installation process in /usr/sap/TE1/home/te1adm .

## Example 8-23 Full script to create users for SAP

```
mkgroup -A id=300 sapsys mkgroup -A id=301 sapinst mkgroup -A id=303 dbte1ctl mkgroup -A id=304 dbte1mnt mkgroup -A id=305 dbte1adm mkgroup -A id=306 dbte1mon mkuser id=300 pgrp=dbte1ctl shell='/bin/csh' groups='dbte1ctl,staff' home='/home/temp' gecos='SAP Database Administrator' db2te1 chuser fsize='-1' data='-1' stack='-1' rss='-1' cpu='-1' nofiles='8000' db2te1 chuser home='/db2/db2te1' db2te1 echo db2te1:A300B0 | chpasswd -c mkuser id=310 pgrp=sapsys shell='/bin/csh' groups='sapsys,staff,sapinst,dbte1ctl' home='/home/temp' gecos='SAP System Administrator' te1adm chuser fsize='-1' data='-1' stack='-1' rss='-1' cpu='-1' nofiles='8000' te1adm chuser home='/usr/sap/TE1/home/te1adm' te1adm echo te1adm:A310B0 | chpasswd -c mkuser id=305 pgrp=sapsys shell='/bin/csh' groups='sapsys,dbte1ctl' home='/home/temp' gecos='ABAP Database Connect User' sapsr3 chuser fsize='-1' data='-1' stack='-1' rss='-1' cpu='-1' nofiles='8000' sapsr3 chuser home='/usr/sap/TE1/home/sapsr3' sapsr3 echo sapsr3:A305B0 | chpasswd -c mkuser id=320 pgrp=sapsys shell='/bin/csh' groups='sapsys,sapinst' home='/home/temp' gecos='SAP System Administrator' sapadm chuser fsize='-1' data='-1' stack='-1' rss='-1' cpu='-1' nofiles='8000' sapadm chuser home='/usr/sap/TE1/home/sapadm' sapadm echo sapadm:A320B0 | chpasswd -c mkuser id=323 pgrp=sapsys shell='/bin/csh' groups='sapsys,sapinst' home='/home/temp' gecos='SAP System Administrator' da1adm chuser fsize='-1' data='-1' stack='-1' rss='-1' cpu='-1' nofiles='8000' da1adm chuser home='/usr/sap/TE1/home/da1adm' da1adm echo da1adm:A323B0 | chpasswd -c chgroup users=sapsr3 dbte1ctl
```

Important: To change the user, you need to set the CLUSTER\_OVERRIDE=yes variable.

The resulting /etc/password is as shown in Example 8-24.

## Example 8-24   /etc/password entry for SAP users

db2te1:!:300:305:SAP Database Administrator:/db2/db2te1:/bin/csh te1adm:!:310:300:SAP System Administrator:/usr/sap/TE1/home/te1adm:/bin/csh sapsr3:!:305:300:ABAP Database Connect User:/usr/sap/TE1/home/sapsr3:/bin/csh sapadm:!:320:300:SAP System Administrator:/home/sapadm:/bin/csh da1adm:!:323:300:SAP System Administrator:/home/da1adm:/bin/csh

2. Create the correct file directories by using the script that is shown in Example 8-25.

Example 8-25   Script to create home user directories

```
mkdir -p /usr/sap/TE1/home/sapadm mkdir -p /usr/sap/TE1/home/da1adm chown -R te1adm /usr/sap/TE1/sapadm chown -R te1adm /usr/sap/TE1/da1adm mkdir -p /db2/TE1/home/db2te1 mkdir -p /usr/sap/TE1/home/te1adm chown -R db2te1 /db2/TE1 chown -R te1adm /usr/sap/TE1
```

3. Create the following links:
2. -cd /usr/sap ; In -s /export/saptrans trans
3. -mkdir /sapmnt ; cd /sapmnt ; ln -s /export/sapmnt/TE1 TE1
4. -cd /db2 ; ln -s TE1/db2te1 db2te1
5. -Copy the following file systems from the SAP installation to the WPAR:
- /usr/sap/TE1
- /usr/sap/DA1
- /usr/sap/ccms
- /usr/sap/hostctrl
- /usr/sap/sapservices
- /usr/sap/trans
- /export/saptrans
- /export/sapmnt
- /db2/TE1
- /var/db2
- /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/*sap*
- /etc/services
- /home/sapadm
- /home/da1adm
4. Ensure that the profiles are up-to-date with the WPAR name wparsvc1 . The content and names must reflect the current host name in the following directories (Example 8-26):
21. -/sapmnt/TE1/profile

```
root@wparsvc1 /sapmnt/TE1/profile # ls DEFAULT.1.PFL             START_DVEBMGS02_wpar1svc DEFAULT.PFL               TE1_DVEBMGS02_wpar1svc root@wparsvc1 /sapmnt/TE1/profile # grep wparsvc1 * DEFAULT.1.PFL:SAPDBHOST = wparsvc1 DEFAULT.1.PFL:j2ee/dbhost = wparsvc1 DEFAULT.1.PFL:SAPGLOBALHOST = wparsvc1 DEFAULT.1.PFL:rdisp/mshost = wparsvc1 DEFAULT.PFL:SAPDBHOST = wparsvc1 DEFAULT.PFL:j2ee/dbhost = wparsvc1 DEFAULT.PFL:SAPGLOBALHOST = wparsvc1 DEFAULT.PFL:rdisp/mshost = wparsvc1 START_DVEBMGS02_wpar1svc:SAPLOCALHOST = wparsvc1 START_DVEBMGS02_wpar1svc:_PF = $(DIR_PROFILE)/TE1_DVEBMGS02_wpar1svc TE1_DVEBMGS02_wpar1svc:SAPLOCALHOST = wparsvc1
```

Example 8-26   Host name change in /sapmnt/TE1/profile

- -//usr/sap/TE1/home/te1adm
5. Modify the DB2 configuration files to match the WPAR name:
- -/db2/TE1/db2te1/sqllib/db2nodes.cfg
- -/usr/sap/TE1/SYS/global/db6/db2cli.ini

## Starting SAP

To start the SAP environment, you need to be user te1adm that you created earlier. It executes its own profile and you can start, monitor, and stop SAP . Example 8-27 shows starting SAP by using the startsap wparsvc1 command.

Example 8-27 Output of SAP start

```
# su - te1adm wparsvc1:te1adm 1> startsap wparsvc1 Checking db6 db Database ------------------------------Database is not available via R3trans Running /usr/sap/TE1/SYS/exe/run/startdb 03/22/2012 11:18:57     0   0   SQL1063N  DB2START processing was successful.

```

## Check that SAP works correctly

To check that SAP works, we can use actual applications. For our purposes, we use SAP commands to check the status of SAP and to verify that it is running. Example 8-28 shows the output of the SAP command.

Example 8-28 Checking the status of the SAP instance

```
wparsvc1:te1adm 2> /usr/sap/TE1/DVEBMGS02/exe/sapcontrol -prot NI_HTTP -nr 02 -function GetProcessList 22.03.2012 11:27:23 GetProcessList OK name, description, dispstatus, textstatus, starttime, elapsedtime, pid msg_server, MessageServer, GREEN, Running, 2012 03 22 11:21:59, 0:05:24, 1572936 disp+work, Dispatcher, GREEN, Running, Message Server connection ok, Dialog Queue time: 0.00 sec, 2012 03 22 11:21:59, 0:05:24, 2097170 igswd_mt, IGS Watchdog, GREEN , Running, 2012 03 22 11:21:59, 0:05:24, 2621502
```

The GREEN indicator that is shown in Example 8-28 on page 518 indicates that our SAP instance runs within the WPAR.

## 8.5.4  Setting the cluster

Because we created the cluster earlier, we only need to create an RG that is called wparsvc1 (name of the WPAR and the name of the RG must be identical).

To see how to create a simple cluster, see Chapter 3, 'PowerHA 7.1.1 basic installation and configuration' on page 73.

All commands can be issued by using the usual tools, such as smit , clmgr on the command line, or the System Director plug-in. In some cases, where the command line is usable, it is listed as an option.

We create a cluster with two nodes and one repository disk, and we create the appropriate RG for the PowerHA function with the WPAR.

We highlight specific tasks:

- Create the sap application controller scripts by using the cm\_add\_app\_scripts and check that they can execute in both nodes. Examples of these scripts are shown in Example 8-29.

```
root@wpar1 /usr/local # cat startwpar.sh #!/usr/bin/ksh93 if df |grep -w /usr/sap then mount /usr/sap fi if [[ ! -d /usr/sap/TE1/home/te1adm ]] then print "te1adm home directory doesn't exist" exit 1 fi
```

Example 8-29   Example of start and stop scripts

```
su - te1adm -c startsap wpar1sap su - te1adm -c /usr/sap/TE1/DVEBMGS02/exe/sapcontrol -prot NI_HTTP -nr 02 -function GetProcessList su - te1adm -c /usr/sap/TE1/DVEBMGS02/exe/sapcontrol -prot NI_HTTP -nr 02 -function GetProcessList |grep -w GREEN rc=$? if [[ $rc == 0 ]] then print "SAP started and is GREEN" fi return $rc #------------------------------------------------# root@wpar1 /usr/local # cat stopwpar.sh #!/usr/bin/ksh93 savebase export CLUSTER_OVERRIDE=yes su - te1adm -c stopsap wpar1sap su - te1adm -c /usr/sap/TE1/DVEBMGS02/exe/sapcontrol -prot NI_HTTP -nr 02 -function GetProcessList umount -f /export umount -f /db2 umount -f /usr/sap return 0
```

- Add the scripts for starting and stopping the WPAR by using cm\_cludrestype\_add (Example 8-30). Check by using the cllsserv command.

- Start the cluster by using the /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clstart command or smitty.
- Bring the resource group online.
- Check failover to the other node. The WPAR restarts.

## 8.5.5  Using the command line to create the cluster

To reproduce the scenario, we list the commands that are required to install, configure, and test the cluster as shown in Example 8-34.

Example 8-34   Short commands to create the cluster

```

## 8.6  NFS versioned 5.2 WPAR

This scenario uses an NFS versioned WPAR with PowerHA. Check the planning information in 8.2.5, 'Planning for a versioned WPAR' on page 492. We use a mksysb image of an AIX 5.2 release.

The configuration of the network is similar to the previous NFS scenario. Only the WPAR changed because it moved from a standard shared WPAR to a private NFS versioned WPAR as seen in figure Figure 8-12 on page 524.

## Application to run in the WPAR

The application can be the same as in 8.4, 'Scenario with a local WPAR' on page 497. The start and stop scripts are shown in Example 8-35.

```
# cat /usr/local/ha/StartA #!/usr/bin/ksh # [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x # Name=$(basename $0 ) if [ "$Name" = "StartA" ] then echo "$(date) \"Application A started\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log touch /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup nohup /usr/local/bin/ApplA & exit 0 elif [ "$Name" = "StopA" ] then rm -f /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup echo "$(date) \"Application A stopped\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 0 else echo "$(date) \"ERROR - Application A start/stop script called with wrong name\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 999 fi
```

Example 8-35   Sample start and stop controller scripts for application ApplA

```
#---------------------------------------------------# # cat /usr/local/ha/StopA #!/usr/bin/ksh # [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x # Name=$(basename $0 ) if [ "$Name" = "StartA" ] then echo "$(date) \"Application A started\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log touch /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup nohup /usr/local/bin/ApplA & exit 0 elif [ "$Name" = "StopA" ] then rm -f /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup echo "$(date) \"Application A stopped\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 0 else echo "$(date) \"ERROR - Application A start/stop script called with wrong name\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log exit 1 fi
```

The user application is shown in Example 8-36.

# [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x while [ -a /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup ] do echo "$(date) \"Application A is running\" " >> /var/hacmp/adm/applA.log sleep 10 done
```

## Creating the WPAR

The WPAR is created on an NFS server that uses the following specs:

- It has its own service address of 172.16.21.64 .
- The server is named wpar1svc3 to match /etc/host entry for address 172.16.21.64 .
- The mksysb image is called AIX52New.mksysb .

The command-line script to create the WPAR is shown in Example 8-37. Or, you can use the smit wpar fast path.

Example 8-37   Simple SAP NFS WPAR creation

#!/usr/bin/ksh

WPARNAME=wparsvc3 addr=172.16.21.64 NFSHOST=172.16.21.65 NFSROOT=/install/wpar/wpars

MKSYSB=/install/wpar/AIX52New.mksysb

#Local mount the shared file system located on NFS server mount $NFSHOST/install /install LNFSROOT=$NFSROOT echo Creating wpar $WPARNAME with address $addr on server $NFSHOST in $NFSROOT from mksysb $MKSYSB # location of NFS wpar NFSVERS=3 # definition for private /usr and /opt PRIVATE\_FLAG=-l NFS\_EXTRA\_PRIVATE="\ -M directory=/usr vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr mountopts=vers=$NFSVERS \ -M directory=/opt vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/opt mountopts=vers=$NFSVERS" mkdir -p $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME || error chmod +x $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var/hacmp/adm mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/home mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/opt mkdir $LNFSROOT/$WPARNAME/usr mkwpar -F $PRIVATE\_FLAG -r -N address=$addr interface=en0 interface=en0 -n $WPARNAME \ -M directory=/ vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/ mountopts=vers=$NFSVERS \ -M directory=/var vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var mountopts=vers=$NFSVERS  \ -M directory=/var/hacmp/adm vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/var/hacmp/adm mountopts=vers=$NFSVERS  \ -M directory=/home vfs=nfs host=$NFSHOST dev=$NFSROOT/$WPARNAME/home mountopts=vers=$NFSVERS  \ $NFS\_EXTRA\_PRIVATE  \ -C -B $MKSYSB

The major difference is the use of parameters ' -C -B -l '. For more explanation, see Exploiting IBM AIX Workload Partitions , SG24-7955.

When the WPAR is created, you can use the lswpar command to check for the disk and the main parameters as presented in Example 8-38.

Because we created the WPAR, it is possible to create it on the other system by using the mkwpar -pf command.

## Creating the WPAR on the second node

Create the specfile on the first node and create the WPAR on the second node by using the specfile that you created. The commands are listed in Example 8-39.

```
mkwpar -w -e wparsvc3 -o /install/wpar/CFG/wparsvc3.spec # ON THE OTHER NODE mkwpar -pf /install/wpar/CFG/wparsvc3.spec ********************************************************************** Warning mkwpar: 0960-125 network.address: 172.16.21.64/255.255.254.0 is not in the same network as any of the global interfaces. ********************************************************************** mkwpar: Creating file systems... / /home /nre/opt /nre/sbin /nre/usr /opt /proc /var/hacmp/adm /usr /var Workload partition wparsvc3 created successfully. mkwpar: 0960-390 To start the workload partition, execute the following as root: startwpar [-v] wparsvc3
```

Example 8-39   Create the WPAR by using the specfile

WPAR wparsvc3 is now defined and running in both nodes.

## 8.6.1  Creating the resource group

For more details about the RG creation, see 8.5.4, 'Setting the cluster' on page 518.

Follow these steps:

1. Create the RG wparsvc3 (Figure 8-13 on page 528).

Figure 8-13   Create RG wparsvc3

<!-- image -->

2. Create the associated service IP address (Figure 8-14).
3. Modify the RG to make it WPAR-enabled by using the same application controller as shown in Example 8-40 with the service address wparsvc3 . Both RGs are independently started. You might want to create a separate controller group and have specific scripts for each WPAR.

## AIX upgrades and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0

This appendix provides a supported upgrade procedure of the AIX operating system from AIX 7.1 Technology Level (TL) 00 to AIX 7.1 TL01 (or from AIX 6.1 TL06 to AIX 6.1 TL07). The procedure must be used when you have a PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 cluster that is deployed in your AIX environment.

Because AIX 7.1 TL01 and AIX 6.1 TL07 technology levels modified Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) significantly, the CAA cluster must be removed before the AIX upgrade and recreated after the upgrade. Finally, PowerHA remains at version 7.1.0, but after the operating system upgrade is running on top of the new AIX 7.1 TL01 or AIX 6.1 TL07. See the detailed procedure steps in 'Upgrading AIX' on page 532.

The last section of this appendix,'Upgrading to PowerHA 7.1.1' on page 544, presents our results of using a simple procedure by which we are able to successfully upgrade the PowerHA 7.1.0 already running on top of AIX 7.1 TL1 to PowerHA 7.1.1.

## Upgrading AIX

Use the following steps to upgrade AIX while you keep PowerHA at 7.1.0 level:

1. Prepare the AIX upgrade:
- a. Save a cluster snapshot, make the usual backups (data, binaries, and mksysb ), and prepare a back-out plan.
- b. Check software consistency and ensure that the cluster state and configuration are error-free on all nodes.
2. Perform the AIX upgrade:
- a. Apply the latest AIX Service Pack for the running version.
- b. Stop PowerHA cluster services on all nodes.
- c. Remove the CAA cluster.
- d. Upgrade the AIX on all nodes in the cluster.
- e. Recreate the CAA cluster from PowerHA SystemMirror.
- f. Restart the PowerHA cluster services.

## Preparing the AIX upgrade

Plan to stop the cluster and perform the following steps to update the AIX operating system technology levels (AIX 6.1 TL07, AIX 7.1 TL01, or later AIX releases). The cluster configuration information is retained and reused. You do not need to reenter it.

Any set of actions that involves modifications at the operating system or cluster level must be preceded by back-out (reversion) planning, including the following operations:

- Back up the data and binaries of all applications.
- Take a cluster snapshot, save it locally, and save it to another machine.
- Save a copy of any custom script files locally and to another machine.
- Perform a mksysb backup of each involved node.

With the back-out plan, you can restore the application data and binaries easily and the cluster and AIX configuration in case you run into problems.

Then, perform the usual software consistency checks:

- Ensure that all nodes are at the same level of operating system and cluster software. Check that the cluster software is committed (and not merely applied). Use the oslevel -s and lslpp -L cluster\* commands.
- Verify that the software is consistent on all nodes by using the lppchk -v command.

Before you start the actual upgrade, check the overall status of your cluster:

1. Ensure that the cluster is started on all nodes, stable, and in a normal operating state. Run the clmgr view report status command on either node and check the state of the cluster, resource groups, interfaces, and System Resource Controller (SRC) subsystems (Example A-1).

Example A-1   Initial cluster state

```
root@migr5 / # clmgr view report status Obtaining information via SNMP from Node: migr5...
```

You might get equivalent status information by using other Simple Network Management

Protocol (SNMP)-based commands, such as cldump or clstat -o , that are combined with clshowsrv -v . Also, instead of SNMP-based commands, you can use lssrc -ls clstrmgrES , clRGinfo , and netstat -in .

2. Ensure that the cluster has no pending changes on any of its nodes. Run a verification from SMIT, which is explained in step 3.

If changes are pending on one node and you choose to apply them on top of the current configuration, check them, decide on a final configuration, and run a Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration operation. In an active cluster, some changes might not be allowed. If you really need these changes, you must stop the cluster services.

If you decide to cancel any pending changes on any node and to keep the currently active configuration, run on either node smit sysmirror  Problem Determination Tools  Restore PowerHA SystemMirror Configuration Database from Active Configuration . Then, select Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration on the same node. You might avoid the last synchronization by restoring the default cluster configuration from the active configuration on each of the cluster nodes.

3. Check that the cluster has no configuration errors.

Run the Verify Cluster Configuration operation on either cluster node by following the path smitty sysmirror  Problem Determination Tools  PowerHA SystemMirror Verification  Verify Cluster Configuration . Select No for the 'Verify changes only?' field and press Enter. The result is shown in Figure A-1.

## Performing the AIX update

To perform the update, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that all nodes in the cluster are running the same and most recent version of the AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror software.

Obtain out the latest updates (service packs) that are available for the current versions of AIX and PowerHA SystemMirror in your cluster nodes. Apply these service packs in order to eliminate any known bug that might affect the migration.

In our test environment, we start from AIX 7.1 TL00 SP1 and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 SP1 (Example A-3).

Example A-3   Initial cluster state and software version

```
root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-01-1037 Or gather the information using the following command: # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/halevel -s root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7101
```

```
cluster fix level is "1" root@migr5 / # root@migr6 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-01-1037 root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7101 cluster fix level is "1" root@migr6 / #
```

We update to the latest levels that are available at the time of writing this book, AIX 7.1 TL00 SP04 and PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.0 SP05. Then, we ensure that everything is fine after the update by running again a Verify and Synchronize operation, followed by a cluster startup and status check (Example A-4).

```
root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-04-1140 root@migr5 / # lppchk -v root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7105 cluster fix level is "5" root@migr5 / # root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-00-04-1140 root@migr5 / # lppchk -v root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7105 cluster fix level is "5" root@migr5 / #
```

Example A-4   Cluster state and software versions after we apply the latest service packs

2. Stop PowerHA cluster services on all nodes.

Use the smitty clstop command. Select all nodes and choose 'Bring Resource Groups Offline' as an action on the resource groups (Figure A-2 on page 539).

Stop Cluster Services

Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes.

Figure A-2   Stopping cluster services on both nodes

Ensure that the PowerHA cluster services are stopped in all nodes (Example A-5).

## 3. Remove the CAA cluster.

Use lscluster and lspv to get information about the cluster name and repository disk port VLAN (virtual local area network) identifier (PVID) (Example A-6).

Example A-6   Finding the CAA cluster name and repository disk PVID

root@migr5 / # lscluster -c

Cluster query for cluster clmigr56 returns:

Cluster uuid: 7d2b1d10-7b21-11e1-a317-b6fcca1bda70

Number of nodes in cluster = 2

Cluster id for node migr5 is 1

Primary IP address for node migr5 is 172.16.21.75

Cluster id for node migr6 is 2

Primary IP address for node migr6 is 172.16.21.76

Number of disks in cluster = 0

Multicast address for cluster is 228.16.21.75

root@migr5 / #

Use the rmcluster -n &lt; clusterName &gt; command in one node to remove the cluster. Then, check that the cluster is successfully removed with the lscluster -m command (Example A-7).

```
root@migr5 / # rmcluster -n clmigr56 rmcluster: Removed cluster shared disks are automatically renamed to names such as hdisk10, [hdisk11, ...] on all cluster nodes.  However, this cannot take place while a disk is busy or on a node which is down or not reachable.  If any disks cannot be renamed now, you must manually rename them. root@migr5 / # lscluster -m Cluster services are not active. root@migr5 / # root@migr6 / # lscluster -m Cluster services are not active. root@migr6 / #
```

Example A-7   Removing the CAA cluster

The repository disk must now be cleaned of any CAA Logical Volume Manager (LVM) structure on any node. See hdisk2 in Example A-8.

Example A-8   Checking that the previous repository disk is clean

| root@migr6 /   | #                |        |        |

Repository disk PVID: If problems appear here, call IBM support. Do not try any action that might change the PVID of the repository disk. The PVID is needed later to recreate the CAA cluster with the same repository disk.

4. Upgrade AIX on all nodes in the cluster.

Upgrade the AIX to version 7.1 TL01 or later by using a supported procedure. In our scenario, we upgrade to the latest level available at the time of writing this book, AIX 7.1 TL01 SP3. Ensure that you restart the systems after the upgrade (Example A-9 on page 541).

Configuration files: Use a supported upgrade procedure and appropriate software sources (download or media); otherwise, you might overwrite the configuration files. For example, if you use AIX 7.1 TL01 base media to update from AIX 7.1 TL00, you might overwrite the /etc/cluster/rhosts file.

```
root@migr5 / # uptime 11:16AM   up   1:38,  1 user,  load average: 1.27, 1.24, 1.17 root@migr5 / # oslevel -s 7100-01-03-1207 root@migr5 / # lppchk -v root@migr5 / # root@migr6 / # uptime 11:16AM   up   1:38,  1 user,  load average: 1.19, 1.26, 1.16 root@migr6 / # oslevel -s 7100-01-03-1207 root@migr6 / # lppchk -v root@migr6 / #
```

Example A-9   Checking the AIX upgrade

5. Recreate the CAA cluster from PowerHA SystemMirror.

Ensure that /etc/cluster/rhosts and clcomd are in a good state (Example A-10).

```
root@migr5 / # clrsh migr5 hostname
```

Example A-10   Checking the clcomd communication

```
migr5 root@migr5 / # clrsh migr6 hostname migr6 root@migr5 / # root@migr6 / # clrsh migr5 hostname migr5 root@migr6 / # clrsh migr6 hostname migr6 root@migr6 / #

## Upgrading to PowerHA 7.1.1

We present a simple procedure by which we can upgrade the PowerHA 7.1.0 that already runs on top of AIX 7.1 TL1 SP3 to PowerHA 7.1.1. This procedure is adapted from the official procedure for offline migration of a PowerHA 7.1.0 cluster that runs on top of AIX 7.1 TL00, which is presented in 6.3.1, 'Offline migration from PowerHA 7.1.0 version' on page 321. The AIX and the CAA cluster are already at the required versions for PowerHA 7.1.1. So, we skip the step of removing the CAA cluster and the step of upgrading the AIX. After we upgrade the PowerHA filesets, we also skip the step of recreating the CAA cluster by using the clmkcaa utility script. We used the following high-level steps of the simplified procedure:

1. Prepare the PowerHA upgrade:
- a. Save a cluster snapshot, make the usual backups (data, binaries, and mksysb ), and prepare a back-out plan.
- b. Check the software consistency and ensure that the cluster state and configuration are error-free on all nodes.

These steps are similar to the steps in 'Preparing the AIX upgrade' on page 532, which are already documented in this appendix.

2. Perform the PowerHA upgrade to 7.1.1:
- a. Stop PowerHA cluster services on all nodes.
- b. Upgrade PowerHA filesets on all nodes to 7.1.1, which is the latest service pack.
- c. Restart the PowerHA cluster services, node-by-node.

We present these three steps in depth.

## Perform the PowerHA upgrade to 7.1.1

With all preparations already performed, we follow these steps:

1. Stop PowerHA cluster services on all nodes.

Use the smitty clstop command. Select all nodes and choose Bring Resource Groups Offline as an action on the resource groups (Figure A-4).

Stop Cluster Services

Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes.

Figure A-4 Stopping cluster services on both nodes

Ensure that the PowerHA cluster services are stopped on all nodes (Example A-13).

## Example A-13 Checking that the cluster is stopped

root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep state Current state: ST\_INIT root@migr5 / #

root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|grep state

Current state: ST\_INIT

root@migr6 / #

2. Upgrade the PowerHA filesets on all nodes to version 7.1.1 and apply the latest service pack.

In our scenario, after we apply SP02 for PowerHA 7.1.1, which is the latest available SP at the time of writing this book. Example A-14 shows the PowerHA 7.1.1 fileset versions after the upgrade.

```
root@migr6 / # lppchk -v cluster\* root@migr6 / # lslpp -l cluster\*|grep -p Level Fileset                      Level  State      Description
```

Figure A-5   Cluster starts up correctly on the first node

Then, ensure that the node successfully joins the cluster (Example A-15). Although the software is updated at the 7.1.1 level, the node still runs at version 12.

## Example A-15   First node joined the cluster

```
root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7112 cluster fix level is "2" root@migr5 / #
```

Repeat the procedure for each node of the cluster, one node at a time.

After you start the cluster services on the latest node and it joins the cluster, you can check the cluster version update (Example A-16).

```
root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_JOINING CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 0 cluster fix level is "ffffffff" root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_BARRIER CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7112
```

Example A-16   Last node joins the cluster

```
cluster fix level is "2" root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 12 local node vrmf is 7112 cluster fix level is "2" root@migr6 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 13 local node vrmf is 7112 cluster fix level is "2" root@migr6 / # root@migr5 / # lssrc -ls clstrmgrES|egrep "state|version|vrmf|fix" Current state: ST_STABLE CLversion: 13 local node vrmf is 7112 cluster fix level is "2" root@migr5 / #
```

Select a final Verify and Synchronize Cluster Configuration to ensure that the cluster runs error-free (Figure A-6).

Alternate path: By combining the steps in 'Upgrading AIX' on page 532 and 'Upgrading to PowerHA 7.1.1' on page 544, we can perform a complete PowerHA migration from version 7.1.0 that is running on top of AIX 7.1.0. This alternate path resembles the standard offline migration. The clmkcaa utility script is not used.

Appendix B.

## Configuring the PowerHA cluster by using clmgr

This appendix provides information about the clmgr command-line utility available in PowerHA 7.1.1. First introduced in PowerHA 7.1.0, this utility provides a consistent, reliable interface for performing PowerHA cluster operations, such as cluster configuration and management.

We describe these topics in this appendix:

- Introduction to clmgr
- Full syntax for the clmgr command and basic format
- Cluster configuration topology
- Cluster configuration resources
- Cluster verification and synchronization
- Cluster start and stop
- Cluster management

## Introduction to clmgr

The clmgr is a command-line utility that can manage all PowerHA capabilities (for example, all tasks that can be managed through SMIT). The purpose of clmgr is to provide a consistent, reliable interface for performing PowerHA cluster operations by using a terminal or script. In release 7.1.1, the clmgr is enhanced to support all Cluster Single Point of Control (C-SPOC) functionalities that are missing in the previous release. This utility is improved to be case insensitive ; therefore, it allows users to type CLUSTER , Cluster , or cluster to get the same results.

One earlier limitation of the clmgr command is that it requires all actions, classes, and attribute labels to be fully spelled out by the user. This limitation is addressed and removed with the new clmgr utility. Now, users can type aliases for actions, classes, and attributes to perform the tasks. For more details, see the clmgr man page.

The output from the clmgr command is displayed in the format ' ATTRIBUTE-NAME=VALUE '.

All clmgr command operations are logged in the clutils.log file. This file saves the operation in verbose-enabled format. This format includes the name of the command that is executed, the start and stop times, and the name that initiated the command. Example B-1 is sample data from the clutils.log file.

```

```

Example B-1   Output from the clutils.log file

Sites: At the time of writing this book, site support is not available in PowerHA so clmgr does not allow users to configure and manage sites.

## Full syntax for the clmgr command and basic format

The following syntax is the full syntax of the clmgr command:

```
clmgr [-c|-x] [-S] [-v] [-f] [-D] [-l {low|med|high|max}] [-T <ID>] [-a {<ATTR#1>,<ATTR#2>,...}] <ACTION> <CLASS> [<NAME>]
```

```
[-h | <ATTR#1>=<VALUE#1> <ATTR#2>=<VALUE#2> <ATTR#n>=<VALUE#n>] ACTION={add|modify|delete|query|online|offline|...} CLASS={cluster|node|network|resource_group|...} clmgr {-h|-?} [-v] clmgr [-v] help Use the following basic format the clmgr command: clmgr < ACTION > < CLASS > [< NAME >] [< ATTRIBUTES ...>]
```

The command uses the following flags:

- ACTION

This flag describes the operation to be performed. ACTION is not case-sensitive. Aliases are provided for command-line use and must not be used in script . Four ACTIONs are available:

- -Add (Alias: a)
- -Query (Alias: q)
- -Modify (Aliases: mod, ch, and set)
- -Delete (Aliases: de, rm, and er)

For a detailed list of the available ACTIONs, see the clmgr manual page.

- CLASS

This flag contains the type of object on which the ACTION is performed. Aliases are provided for command-line use and must not be used in scripts . Some of the available CLASSes are listed:

- -Cluster (Alias: cl)
- -Node (Alias: no)
- -Interface (Aliases: in and if)
- -Network (Aliases: ne and nw)

A detailed list is available in the clmgr man page.

- Name

This flag contains the specific object of type CLASS, on which ACTION is to be performed.

- ATTR=value

This flag is optional and has attribute pairs and value pairs that are specific to the ACTION+CLASS combination.

## Cluster configuration topology

We describe how to configure the topology components of the PowerHA cluster by using clmgr . The topology-related components are listed:

- Cluster
- Nodes

## Cluster

The cluster action is specified to configure a PowerHA cluster with a user-specified name. When this command is executed without specifying any node name, it takes the local node name or the host from where clmgr runs as the first node of the cluster (Example B-2).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add cluster &lt; CLS-name &gt; [REPOSITORY=&lt; hdisk# &gt; CLUSTER\_IP=&lt; multicast IP address &gt;]

Example B-2   Command to create a cluster

root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add cluster clmgr\_cluster REPOSITORY=hdisk2 CLUSTER\_IP=228.1.1.36 Warning: since no nodes were specified for this cluster, a one-node cluster will be created with this system: "clmgr1" Cluster Name: clmgr\_cluster Cluster Connection Authentication Mode: Standard Cluster Message Authentication Mode: None Cluster Message Encryption: None Use Persistent Labels for Communication: No Repository Disk: None Cluster IP Address: There are 1 node(s) and 1 network(s) defined NODE clmgr1: Network net\_ether\_02 clmgr1b2        10.1.2.54

Discovering Volume Group Configuration

```
Current cluster configuration: root@clmgr1 / #
```

The warning message states that a one-node cluster is configured. The system, from which clmgr is executed, is added as the first node of the cluster. The example configures a one-node cluster named clmgr\_cluster with node clmgr1 as the first node of the cluster.

## Node

The node action is used to add nodes or servers to the cluster (Example B-3).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add node &lt; node-name &gt; [COMMPATH=&lt; communication path to the node &gt;]

Example B-3   Command to add a node root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add node clmgr2 Attempting to discover available resources on "clmgr2"...

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-3 adds node clmgr2 to the cluster. Execute this command for all cluster nodes in your configuration.

## Network

The network or nw action is used to create or add a network in the PowerHA cluster (Example B-4).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add network &lt; network-name &gt; [TYPE={ether|infiniband} NETMASK=&lt; 255.255.x.x &gt; | PREFIX=1..128]

Example B-4 Command to add a network root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add network net\_ether\_01 TYPE=ether

root@clmgr1 / #

This example creates an ethertype network that is labeled net\_ether\_01 and adds it to the cluster configuration. If your cluster configuration needs more networks, you can execute the same command.

## Interface

The interface action is used to add communication interfaces to the network in the PowerHA cluster (Example B-5 on page 557).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add interface &lt; interface-label &gt; NETWORK=&lt; network-name &gt; [NODE=&lt; node &gt; TYPE={ether|infiniband} INTERFACE=&lt; network-interface &gt;]

Example B-5   Command to add an interface to the network

root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add interface clmgr2b2 NETWORK=net\_ether\_02 NODE=clmgr2 INTERFACE=en1

root@clmgr1 / #

To eliminate a communication interface from becoming a single point of failure (SPOF), add more interfaces.

## Persistent IP/label

The persistent\_ip action is used to add a persistent IP address for the network in the PowerHA cluster. One persistent IP address or label is allowed per node per network. In a two-node cluster configuration with the ethertype network, at least two persistent IPs are required, one each for node (Example B-6).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add persistent\_ip &lt; persistent\_IP &gt; NETWORK=&lt; network-name &gt; [NODE=&lt; node &gt;]

Example B-6   Command to add a persistent IP label root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add persistent clmgr1p1 NETWORK=net\_ether\_01 NODE=clmgr1

root@clmgr1 / #

You can run the cllsif -p command to check the persistent IPs that are added to the configuration as shown in Example B-7.

Example B-7   Output of cllsif command

root@clmgr1 / # cllsif -p

## Cluster configuration resources

In this section, we show how to configure resources and resource groups by using the clmgr utility. Resource components are the entities that are made highly available when the cluster is in the production state. We configure the following resource components:

- Service IP/label
- Application controller
- Application monitor
- Volume group
- Resource group

## Service IP/label

To configure the service IP/label, we use service\_ip . When this command is executed without specifying any node name, it uses the local node name or the host, from where clmgr is run, as the first node of the cluster (Example B-8).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add service\_ip &lt; Service-label &gt; NETWORK=&lt; network-name &gt; [NETMASK=&lt; 255.x.x.x &gt;]

Example B-8   Command to create the service IP/Label root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add service\_ip clmgrsvc1 NETWORK=net\_ether\_01

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-8 adds the service IP/label clmgrsvc1 to the network net\_ether\_01 . This service IP can be added as a resource to the resource group.

## Application controller

The term application controller is used in PowerHA to refer to the application server start and stop scripts that are used to start and stop the application when the resource group comes online. To configure the application server, we specify the application\_controller action or aliases ac or app (Example B-9).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add application\_controller &lt; app-server-name &gt; STARTSCRIPT='&lt; absolutepath &gt;' STOPSCRIPT='&lt; absolutepath &gt;' [STARTUP\_MODE={background|foreground}]

Example B-9   Command to add the application controller root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add application\_controller test\_app1 STARTSCRIPT="/home/apps/start1.sh" STOPSCRIPT="/home/apps/stop1.sh" STARTUP\_MODE=background

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-9 configures an application controller test\_app1 . Repeat the command if you need more application servers in your configuration.

## Application monitor

Application monitors are optional but highly suggested resource components in PowerHA. Application monitors help ensure that applications function correctly and they are also useful during a forced down or UNMANAGE stop of cluster. You can configure more than one application monitor for the same application controller. The ACTION to be used to configure the application monitor is application\_monitor or am (Example B-10).

Use this syntax:

```
clmgr add application_monitor < monitor-name > TYPE={Process|Custom} APPLICATIONS=< appctrl#1 >[,< appctrl#2... >] MODE={longrunning|startup|both} [STABILIZATION='1 .. 3600' ] [RESTARTCOUNT='0 .. 100'] [FAILUREACTION={notify|fallover} ] Process Arguments: PROCESSES="pmon1,dbmon,..."  \ OWNER="< processes_owner_name >" \ [ INSTANCECOUNT="1 .. 1024" ] \ [ RESTARTINTERVAL="1 .. 3600" ] \ [ NOTIFYMETHOD="< /script/to/notify >" ] \ [ CLEANUPMETHOD="< /script/to/cleanup >" ] \ [ RESTARTMETHOD="< /script/to/restart >" ] Custom Arguments: MONITORMETHOD="/script/to/monitor" \ [ MONITORINTERVAL="1 .. 1024" ] \ [ HUNGSIGNAL="1 .. 63" ] \ [ RESTARTINTERVAL="1 .. 3600"  ] \ [ NOTIFYMETHOD="< /script/to/notify >" ] \ [ CLEANUPMETHOD="< /script/to/cleanup >" ] \ [ RESTARTMETHOD="< /script/to/restart >" ]
```

Example B-10   Command to create the application monitor

root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add application\_monitor monitor1 TYPE=Custom APPLICATIONS=test\_app1 MODE=both STABILIZATION=360 RESTARTCOUNT=2 FAILUREACTION=fallover MONITORMETHOD="/home/apps/appmon1.sh" HUNGSIGNAL=3 RESTARTINTERVAL=30 CLEANUPMETHOD="/home/apps/stop1.sh" RESTARTMETHOD="/home/apps/start1.sh"

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-10 creates an application monitor monitor1 for application controller test\_app1 . This application monitor is a custom-based monitor. You can configure more than one application monitor for the same application controller.

## Volume group

The volume\_group action can be used to create a shared volume group in your configuration as shown in Example B-11 on page 560.

Use this syntax:

clmgr add volume\_group &lt;vg-name&gt; NODES='&lt; node#1 &gt;,&lt; node#2 &gt;[,...&gt;]' PHYSICAL\_VOLUMES='&lt; disk#1 &gt;[,&lt; disk#2 &gt;,...]' [TYPE={original|big|scalable|legacy} ] [MAJOR\_NUMBER=## ] [CONCURRENT\_ACCESS={false|true}] [ACTIVATE\_ON\_RESTART={false|true}] [CRITICAL={false|true} ] \

```
[ FAILURE_ACTION={halt|notify|fence|stoprg|moverg} ] \ [ NOTIFYMETHOD=</file/to/invoke> ]
```

Example B-11   Command to create a shared volume group root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add volume\_group test\_vg1 NODES="clmgr1,clmgr2" PHYSICAL\_VOLUMES=hdisk3 TYPE=original MAJOR\_NUMBER=35 ACTIVATE\_ON\_RESTART=false clmgr1: test\_vg1 clmgr1: mkvg: This concurrent capable volume group must be varied on manually. clmgr1: synclvodm: No logical volumes in volume group test\_vg1. clmgr1: Volume group test\_vg has been updated. clmgr2: synclvodm: No logical volumes in volume group test\_vg1. clmgr2: 0516-783 importvg: This imported volume group is concurrent capable. clmgr2:         Therefore, the volume group must be varied on manually. clmgr2: 0516-1804 chvg: The quorum change takes effect immediately. clmgr2: Volume group test\_vg has been imported. cl\_mkvg: Discovering Volume Group Configuration... clmgr1: 0516-1804 chvg: The quorum change takes effect immediately. root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-11 creates a shared volume group, test\_vg1 , on nodes clmgr1 and clmgr2 of type concurrent .

## Resource group

The resource group is the holding entity that contains resources, such as service IP , volume group, application controller, and file system. The action that is used to configure or add a resource group is resource\_group (Example B-12).

Use this syntax:

clmgr add resource\_group &lt; RG-name &gt; NODES='&lt; node#1 &gt;,&lt; node#2 &gt;[,...&gt;]' [STARTUP={OHN|OFAN|OAAN|OUDP}] [FALLOVER={FNPN|FUDNP|BO}] [FALLBACK={NFB|FBHPN}] [SERVICE\_LABEL=service\_ip#1[,service\_ip#2,...]] [APPLICATIONS=appctlr#1[,appctlr#2,...]] [VOLUME\_GROUP=&lt; VG &gt;[,&lt; VG#2 &gt;,...]] [FILESYSTEM=/file\_system#1[,/file\_system#2,...]] [EXPORT\_FILESYSTEM=/expfs#1[,/expfs#2,...]] [EXPORT\_FILESYSTEM\_V4=/expfs#1[,/expfs#2,...]] [ STABLE\_STORAGE\_PATH="/fs3"] [NFS\_NETWORK="nfs\_network"] [MOUNT\_FILESYSTEM=/nfs\_fs1;/expfs1,/nfs\_fs2;,..]

Example B-12   Command to add a resource group to the cluster

root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add resource\_group clmgr\_RG1 NODES="clmgr1,clmgr2" STARTUP=OHN FALLOVER=FNPN FALLBACK=NFB VOLUME\_GROUP=test\_vg SERVICE\_LABLE=clmgrsvc1 APPLICATIONS=test\_app1

Auto Discover/Import of Volume Groups was set to true. Gathering cluster information, which may take a few minutes. root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-12 creates a resource group that is named clmgr\_RG1 with participating nodes, clmgr1 and clmgr2 , with startup policy Online on Home Node , fallover policy Fallover to Next Priority Node , and fallback set to Never Fallback with a service label, clmgrsvc1 . When the resource group starts, the volume group is activated, the file systems, if any, are mounted,

and the service IP serv\_ip1 is aliased on one of the boot interfaces and made accessible. Run the clmgr add resource\_group command to add more resource groups to your configuration, if needed.

## Cluster verification and synchronization

In this section, we look at the commands and actions for cluster verification and synchronization.

## Cluster verification

Verification is the process to check to ensure that there are no unsupported elements in the configuration. Verification checks to ensure that all resources that are used by PowerHA are configured correctly. Verification checks to ensure that the rules about resource ownership and resource takeover agree across all nodes. Verification must be executed on configuration and reconfiguration (Example B-13).

Use this syntax:

clmgr verify cluster [CHANGES\_ONLY={no|yes}] [DEFAULT\_TESTS={yes|no}] [METHODS=&lt; method#1 &gt;[,&lt; method#2 &gt;,...]] [FIX={no|yes}] [LOGGING={standard|verbose}] [LOGFILE=&lt; PATH\_TO\_LOG\_FILE &gt;] [SYNC={no|yes}] [FORCE={no|yes} ]

Example B-13   Command to run the cluster verification root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr verify cluster CHANGES\_ONLY=no FIX=yes LOGGING=standard Verifying clcomd communication, please be patient.

## Cluster synchronization

Cluster synchronization is the process to make all cluster nodes aware of the cluster configuration. This process updates PowerHA Object Data Managers (ODMs) on cluster nodes with the latest or updated configuration information as shown in Example B-14.

Use this syntax:

clmgr sync cluster [VERIFY={yes|no}] [CHANGES\_ONLY={no|yes}] [ DEFAULT\_TESTS={yes|no}] [METHODS=&lt; method#1 &gt;[,&lt; method#2 &gt;,...]] [FIX={no|yes} ] [LOGGING={standard|verbose}] [LOGFILE=&lt; PATH\_TO\_LOG\_FILE &gt;] [MAX\_ERRORS=##] [FORCE={no|yes}]

## Cluster start and stop

We describe two actions that can be used to start and stop the cluster services on all or some of the cluster nodes:

- Online
- Offline

## Online

The online action can be used to start the cluster services on some or all cluster nodes. If you want to start the entire cluster, you can use online cluster . If the cluster services are to be started one node at a time or some of the nodes, you can use online node &lt; node#1 &gt;[, &lt;node#2&gt; ,...] ( Example B-16).

Use this syntax1 to start the cluster services on all nodes:

clmgr online cluster [ WHEN={now|restart|both} MANAGE={auto|manual} BROADCAST={false|true} CLINFO={false|true|consistent} FORCE={false|true} FIX={no|yes|interactively} TIMEOUT=&lt; seconds\_to\_wait\_for\_completion &gt;]

Example B-16   Command to start cluster services on all nodes

root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr online cluster WHEN=now MANAGE=auto BROADCAST=true CLINFO=true

```

```

Example B-17 on page 569 shows the start of cluster services on node clmgr1. You can run a similar command to start the cluster services on other nodes, as required.

## Offline

The offline action is used to stop the services on all or some of the cluster nodes (Example B-18).

Use this syntax to stop cluster services on all nodes:

clmgr offline cluster [WHEN={now|restart|both} MANAGE={offline|move|unmanage} BROADCAST={true|false} TIMEOUT=&lt; seconds\_to\_wait\_for\_completion &gt;]

```
root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr offline cluster MANAGE=offline Warning: "WHEN" must be specified. Since it was not, a default of "now" will be used. Broadcast message from root@clmgr1 (tty) at 05:30:09 ... HACMP/ES for AIX on clmgr1 shutting down. Please exit any cluster applications... clmgr1: 0513-044 The clinfoES Subsystem was requested to stop. clmgr1: 0513-044 The clevmgrdES Subsystem was requested to stop. clmgr2: 0513-044 The clinfoES Subsystem was requested to stop. clmgr2: 0513-044 The clevmgrdES Subsystem was requested to stop.
```

Example B-18   Command to stop cluster services on all nodes

The cluster is now offline.

```
clmgr1: Mar 22 2012 05:30:09 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clstop: called with flags -N -g clmgr2: Mar 22 2012 05:30:12 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clstop: called with flags -N -g root@clmgr1 / #
```

Example B-18 on page 571 stops the cluster services on all nodes.

Or, use this syntax to stop cluster services on some nodes:

clmgr offline node &lt; node#1 &gt;[,&lt; node#2 &gt;,...] [ WHEN={now|restart|both} MANAGE={offline|move|unmanage} BROADCAST={false|true} FORCE={false|true} FIX={no|yes|interactively} TIMEOUT=&lt; seconds\_to\_wait\_for\_completion &gt;]

Example B-19   Command to stop cluster services on some nodes

```
root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr offline node clmgr1 when=NOW BROADCAST=false MANAGE=offline clmgr1: 0513-044 The clinfoES Subsystem was requested to stop. clmgr1: 0513-044 The clevmgrdES Subsystem was requested to stop. "clmgr1" is now offline. clmgr1: Mar 22 2012 05:39:33 /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clstop: called with flags -N -s -g root@clmgr1 / #
```

Example B-19 shows that cluster services are stopped on node clmgr1 . Y ou can run a similar command to stop cluster services on other nodes, as needed.

## Cluster management

We describe several aspects of cluster management. Cluster management includes various tasks, such as snapshot creation, resource group movement, and the move service IP . We describe the following management tasks:

- Modify cluster label
- Manage cluster
- Manage node
- Move resource group
- Move service IP/label
- Manage application controller
- Add RG dependency
- Cluster snapshot

## Modify the cluster label

The modify action can be used to change the cluster label as shown in Example B-20 on page 573.

Use this syntax:

clmgr modify cluster [NAME=&lt; new\_cluster\_label &gt; NODES=&lt; host &gt;[,&lt; host#2 &gt;,..] CLUSTER\_IP=&lt; IP\_address &gt; DAILY\_VERIFICATION={Enabled|Disabled} VERIFICATION\_NODE={Default|&lt; node &gt;} VERIFICATION\_HOUR=&lt; 00..23 &gt; VERIFICATION\_DEBUGGING={Enabled|Disabled}]

Example B-20   Command to modify the cluster label root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr modify cluster NAME=my\_new\_cls\_label

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-20 changes the cluster name to the new label that is specified. For the change to occur on other cluster nodes, run the cluster verification tool.

Important: Do not change the cluster label or cluster name while services are running.

## Manage cluster

The manage action can be used to discover the cluster, reset cluster tunables, and unlock the cluster on a DARE failure as shown in Example B-21, Example B-22, and Example B-23.

Use this syntax:

clmgr manage cluster {discover|reset|unlock}

Example B-21   Command to run discovery

```
root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr manage cluster discover root@clmgr1 / #
```

Example B-21 runs discovery to fetch PowerHA related information.

Example B-22   Command to remove DARE locks root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr manage cluster unlock cldare: Succeeded removing all DARE locks.

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-23   Command to reset cluster tunables

root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr manage cluster reset clsnapshot: ERROR: The Cluster Services must be stopped with either 'Bring Resource Groups Offline' or 'Move Resource Groups' option for 'Select an Action on Resource Groups' field in the 'Stop Cluster Services' SMIT screen before resetting the cluster tunable.

root@clmgr1 / #

The message in Example B-23 displays when cluster tunables are reset when the cluster services are running.

Important: The cluster must be stopped before you can reset the cluster tunables.

## Manage node

The manage action for the node class can be used to undo the changes for that node as shown in Example B-24.

Use this syntax:

clmgr manage node undo\_changes

Example B-24   Command to undo changes to a node

```
root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr manage node undo_changes clsnapshot: Creating file /usr/es/sbin/cluster/snapshots/Restored_From_ACD.Mar.22.06.26.24.odm. clsnapshot: Succeeded creating Cluster Snapshot: Restored_From_ACD.Mar.22.06.26.24 Successfully restored Default Configuration from Active Configuration. root@clmgr1 / #
```

Example B-24 restores the default configuration from the active configuration.

## Move resource group

The move action can be used to bring the resource group offline or online on a specific node as shown in Example B-25.

Use this syntax:

clmgr move resource\_group &lt; resource\_group &gt;,[&lt; rg#2 &gt;,..] NODE=&lt; node\_label &gt; [STATE={offline|online}]

```
Example B-25   Command to move the resource group root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr move resource_group clmgr_RG1 NODE=clmgr2 Attempting to move resource group clmgr_RG to node clmgr2. Waiting for the cluster to process the resource group movement request.... Waiting for the cluster to stabilize...... Resource group movement successful. Resource group clmgr_RG is online on node clmgr2. Cluster Name: clmgr_cluster Resource Group Name: clmgr_RG1 Node Group State ---------------------------- ---------------
```

clmgr1                       OFFLINE

clmgr2                       ONLINE

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-25 on page 574 moves the resource group clmgr\_RG from node clmgr1 to node clmgr2 .

## Move service IP label

The move action for the service IP label moves the service address from one interface to another. This option can be used if you need to replace the adapter with a new adapter or perform a maintenance task (Example B-26).

Use this syntax:

clmgr move service\_ip &lt; service\_ip &gt; INTERFACE=&lt; new\_interface &gt;

Example B-26   Command to move the service IP

root@clmgr2 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr move service\_ip clmgrsvc1 INTERFACE=en1

swap\_adapter clmgr2 net\_ether\_01 10.1.2.55 clmgrsvc1 swap\_adapter\_complete clmgr2 net\_ether\_01 10.1.2.55 clmgrsvc1

root@clmgr2 / #

Example B-26 moves the service IP/label to the new interface en1 .

## Manage application controller

The manage action for the application controller can be used to suspend or resume application server monitoring for a specific application. Or, it can be used to suspend or resume application server monitoring for all application servers in the resource group as shown in Example B-27.

Use this syntax:

clmgr manage application\_controller {suspend|resume} Resource\_Group=&lt; resource\_group &gt; &lt; application\_controller &gt; | ALL

Example B-27 Command to suspend application monitoring root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr manage application\_controller suspend test\_app1 RESOURCE\_GROUP="clmgr\_RG1" 2012-03-23T20:41:08.570866 2012-03-23T20:41:08.579757 monitor1 Mar 23 2012 20:41:08 cl\_RMupdate: Completed request to suspend monitor(s) for

application test\_app1. Mar 23 2012 20:41:08 cl\_RMupdate: The following monitor(s) are in use for application test\_app1: root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-27 on page 575 suspends application monitoring.

```
root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr manage application_controller resume test_app1 RESOURCE_GROUP="clmgr_RG2" 2012-03-23T20:41:08.570866 2012-03-23T20:41:08.579757 monitor1 Mar 23 2012 20:41:08 cl_RMupdate: Completed request to suspend monitor(s) for application test_app1. Mar 23 2012 20:41:08 cl_RMupdate: The following monitor(s) are in use for application test_app1: root@clmgr1 / #
```

Example B-28   Command to resume application monitoring

Example B-28 resumes application monitoring.

## Add a resource group dependency

The add action for the dependency class can be used to add resource group dependencies, such as parent-child, node collocation, Anti collocation, and start/stop after (Example B-29).

Use this syntax:

- # Temporal dependency (parent ==&gt; child) clmgr add dependency PARENT=&lt; rg#1 &gt; CHILD='&lt; rg#2 &gt;[,&lt; rg#3 &gt;,...]'
- # Temporal dependency (start/stop after) clmgr add dependency {STOP|START}='&lt; rg#2 &gt;[,&lt; rg#3 &gt;,...]' AFTER=&lt; rg#1 &gt;
- # Temporal dependency (collocation)

clmgr add dependency SAME={NODE} GROUPS='&lt; rg1 &gt;,&lt; rg2 &gt;[,&lt; rg#n &gt;]'

- # Temporal dependency (anti-collocation)

clmgr add dependency SAME={NODE} GROUPS='&lt; rg1 &gt;,&lt; rg2 &gt;[,&lt; rg#n &gt;]'

Example B-29   Command to add parent-child dependency

root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add dependency PARENT="clmgr\_RG1" CHILD="clmgr\_RG2"

root@clmgr1 / #

Example B-29 adds a parent-child dependency for the resource groups.

Example B-30   Command to add node-collocation dependency root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add dependency SAME=NODE GROUPS='clmgr\_RG1 clmgr\_RG2'

Example B-30 on page 576 adds a same-node (collocation) dependency between resource groups.

## Cluster snapshot

To create a cluster snapshot, we can use the add action with the CLASS snapshot as shown in Example B-31.

Use this syntax:

clmgr add snapshot &lt; snapshot-name &gt; DESCRIPTION='&lt; snapshot-description &gt;' [METHODS='method1, method2, .. '] [SAVE\_LOGS={false|true}]

```
root@clmgr1 / # /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clmgr add snapshot mySNAP
```

Example B-31   Command to create the cluster snapshot

```
DESCRIPTION="my first snapshot" clsnapshot: Creating file /usr/es/sbin/cluster/snapshots/mySNAP.odm. clsnapshot: Creating file /usr/es/sbin/cluster/snapshots/mySNAP.info. clsnapshot: Executing clsnapshotinfo command on node: clmgr1... clsnapshot: Executing clsnapshotinfo command on node: clmgr2... clsnapshot: Succeeded creating Cluster Snapshot: mySNAP root@clmgr1 / #
```

Example B-31 creates the cluster snapshot.

## Creating the hardware environment by using command-line tools

In this appendix, all scripts that are used to create the hardware environment that is used in this book are shown and explained. In some client environments, there are security or bandwidth network restrictions that do not allow system administrators to use graphical tools to perform tasks. Also, sometimes the environment is too large to be created by using graphical tools.

So, we focus on complex environment creation by using the command-line tools only. No graphical tool is used; only scripts are generated to cover all required tasks.

These scripts cover the following tasks:

- Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) creation that includes Shared Ethernet Adapters (SEA) and N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) configuration
- Client logical partition (LPARs) creation that includes Shared Ethernet Adapters (SEA) and N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) configuration
- Network Installation Management (NIM) client definition and NIM BOS installation procedures
- Storage area network (SAN) zoning
- DS4800 array, logical volume, and host group creation

## Hardware details

We describe the hardware configuration details (Figure C-1).

Figure C-1   Power 750 servers are used in the hardware environment

<!-- image -->

As shown in Figure C-1 and explained in Chapter 1, 'Introducing IBM PowerHA SystemMirror 7.1.1' on page 1, we use three Power 750 servers as part of the hardware environment. For more details about the hardware design, see 1.2, 'Hardware environment' on page 23.

Important: Because all server configurations are similar, this appendix only covers the configuration scripts for Server01-8233-E8B . The same scripts are used on the other two Power 750 servers, only we change the server and LPAR names.

## Virtual I/O Server creation

Because the hardware environment used in this publication is virtualized, the first partitions that are created are the VIOS partitions.

Important: All VIOS creation commands must be used in the Hardware Management Console (HMC) shell.

Example C-1 shows the scripts that are perform all tasks for the VIOS creation.

Example C-1   VIOS profile creation

## Client LPAR creation

We show all commands to create the client LPARs that are used across this book.

HMC: All client LPAR creation commands must be used in the HMC shell.

Example C-3 shows the commands that are used to create the client LPAR profiles.

Example C-3   Client LPAR profile creation mksyscfg -r lpar -m Server01-8233-E8B -i

'name=LPAR01.01,profile\_name=LPAR01.01,lpar\_env=aixlinux,min\_mem=10240,desired\_mem =10240,max\_mem=20480,mem\_mode=ded,proc\_mode=shared,min\_proc\_units=1.0,desired\_proc \_units=1.0,max\_proc\_units=16.0,min\_procs=4,desired\_procs=4,max\_procs=64,sharing\_mo de=uncap,uncap\_weight=128,lpar\_io\_pool\_ids=none,max\_virtual\_slots=150,boot\_mode=no rm,conn\_monitoring=0,auto\_start=0,lpar\_proc\_compat\_mode=default'

mksyscfg -r lpar -m Server01-8233-E8B -i 'name=LPAR02.01,profile\_name=LPAR02.01,lpar\_env=aixlinux,min\_mem=10240,desired\_mem =10240,max\_mem=20480,mem\_mode=ded,proc\_mode=shared,min\_proc\_units=1.0,desired\_proc \_units=1.0,max\_proc\_units=16.0,min\_procs=4,desired\_procs=4,max\_procs=64,sharing\_mo de=uncap,uncap\_weight=128,lpar\_io\_pool\_ids=none,max\_virtual\_slots=150,boot\_mode=no rm,conn\_monitoring=0,auto\_start=0,lpar\_proc\_compat\_mode=default'

Example C-4 shows the commands that are used to create virtual adapters for client LPARs in our environment.

## NIM client definition

After all profiles are correctly set up in the HMC, the next step is to prepare NIM to create new LPARs.

NIM: For more information about the NIM environment configuration and concepts, see the NIM documentation at the IBM information center:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm. aix.install/doc/insgdrf/nim\_intro.htm

Example C-5 shows the steps in the HMC and in the NIM master server to allow all LPAR configuration and BOS installation.

```
# Getting LPARs ethernet adapter physical addresses using HMC lpar_netboot -M -n -t ent "LPAR01.01" "LPAR01.01" "Server01-8233-E8B" # That command shows an output similar to that below: # Connecting to LPAR01.01 # Connected # Checking for power off. # Power off complete. # Power on LPAR01.01 to Open Firmware. # Power on complete. # Getting adapter location codes. # Type  Location Code   MAC Address ent U9124.720.100486A-V5-C2-T1 bad3f0005002 # Using the MAC address above, register server on NIM Server: nim -o define -t'standalone' -a platform=chrp -a netboot_kernel=64 -a if1="nim172 lpar0101 bad3f0005002 ent" -a cable_type1=bnc lpar0101
```

Example C-5   HMC and NIM master server steps

After the NIM client definition, the BOS installation procedure needs to be performed as shown in Example C-6 on page 584. After you perform all required configuration steps (Network File System (NFS) share permissions, bootp, and tftp configuration files), the BOS installation on the NIM master is correctly set up.

```
# The following command performs all steps required for a BOS Install nim -o bos_inst -a source=spot -a spot=aix71 -a lpp_source=aix71_full -a accept_licenses=yes -a bosinst_data=bosinst-jfs2-64 -a preserve_res=yes -a no_client_boot=yes -a set_bootlist=no -a force_push=no lpar0101
```

Example C-6   Performing BOS Installation operation on the NIM master

With the NIM client correctly defined and the NIM BOS installed, perform the client LPAR network boot as shown in Example C-7.

Example C-7   Network boot on client LPARs

```
# Run the following command from the HMC command-line prompt lpar_netboot -t ent -m bad3f0005002 -s auto -d auto -S 172.16.20.40 -G 172.16.20.1 -C 172.16.21.26 "LPAR01.01" "LPAR01.01" "Server01-8233-E8B"
```

Important: Because many questions are asked during a standard AIX operating system installation, the NIM environment allows the use of bosinst\_data scripts . These scripts are used to answer the mandatory AIX operating system installation questions. The bosinst\_data script that is used to build the environment is in Example C-8.

```
root /nimrepo/scripts # cat bosinst.data.jfs264 control_flow: CONSOLE = Default INSTALL_METHOD = overwrite PROMPT = no EXISTING_SYSTEM_OVERWRITE = yes RUN_STARTUP = no RM_INST_ROOTS = no ERROR_EXIT = CUSTOMIZATION_FILE = TCB = no BUNDLES = RECOVER_DEVICES = Default BOSINST_DEBUG = no ACCEPT_LICENSES = yes INSTALL_CONFIGURATION = DESKTOP = CDE INSTALL_DEVICES_AND_UPDATES = yes IMPORT_USER_VGS = yes ENABLE_64BIT_KERNEL = yes CREATE_JFS2_FS = yes ALL_DEVICES_KERNELS = yes GRAPHICS_BUNDLE = no DOC_SERVICES_BUNDLE = no NETSCAPE_BUNDLE = yes HTTP_SERVER_BUNDLE = yes KERBEROS_5_BUNDLE = yes SERVER_BUNDLE = yes ALT_DISK_INSTALL_BUNDLE = yes REMOVE_JAVA_118 = no target_disk_data:
```

Example C-8   bosinst\_data script

```
CONNECTION = LOCATION = SIZE_MB = HDISKNAME = hdisk0
```

```
BOSINST_LANG = en_US CULTURAL_CONVENTION = en_US MESSAGES = en_US KEYBOARD = en_US large_dumplv: DUMPDEVICE = lg_dumplv SIZE_GB = 1
```

```
PVID = locale:
```

## SAN zoning

With the client LPARs correctly installed, configure the SAN environment and allocate the SAN logical unit number (LUN) disks that are required for the cluster scenarios.

On the hardware environment as described in 1.2, 'Hardware environment' on page 23, we use two IBM 2005-B16 switches.

Switch models: All switch syntax commands that are shown work for the same switch model and all compatible models.

## 8.6.2  Alias creation

The first step is the creation of aliases for all hosts and storage ports on the SAN fabric. All aliases must relate to only the hosts that attach to the switch that is configured . To keep things simple, we grouped all aliases together as shown in Example C-9.

```
# The commands below create the alias definitions on IBM 2005-B16 switches ## Switch 01 # Aliases Creation alicreate DS4800_CA_CH1,20:12:00:a0:b8:11:a6:62 alicreate lpar0101_fcs0,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:5e alicreate lpar0201_fcs0,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:60 alicreate lpar0301_fcs0,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:64 alicreate lpar0401_fcs0,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:68 alicreate lpar0501_fcs1,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:6e alicreate lpar0601_fcs1,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:72 alicreate lpar0701_fcs1,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:76 alicreate lpar0801_fcs1,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:7a alicreate lpar0901_fcs0,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:7c alicreate lpar1001_fcs0,c0:50:76:03:03:9e:00:80 alicreate lpar0102_fcs0,c0:50:76:05:06:19:00:02 alicreate lpar0202_fcs0,c0:50:76:05:06:19:00:04

## IBM DS4800 arrays, logical volumes, and host group creation

The last task that is executed to build the environment that we used in this book relates to the DS4800 storage system. Manually, as a first step, we created one large array, PW2201\_Array , with all DS4800 disks. All subsequent tasks are performed by using this array to create the logical volumes.

Important: In a production environment, you need to assess the correct way to create arrays and logical volumes. Ensure that I/O-bound applications do not access the same physical disks and affect performance.

You must execute all of these commands from the Storage Manager for DS4000 script editor . For more information about the Storage Manager tool, see IBM System Storage Solutions Handbook , SG24-5250:

http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg245250.html?Open

We configure the following DS4800 objects (Example C-10):

- DS4800 host groups
- DS4800 hosts
- DS4800 logical volumes/LUN disks

Example C-10   Host group and host creation

After all hosts and host groups are correctly created, the logical volumes are created and allocated to host groups (Example C-11).

Important: All logical volumes are created by using the DS4800 controller A or DS4800 controller B to provide better performance after both storage system controllers are used concurrently for I/O access.

Appendix D.

## Replacing the failed repository disk if any nodes are not joined to the cluster

This appendix describes the steps that you can follow to replace the Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) cluster repository disk in a PowerHA environment if a node is not joined to the cluster. This situation might happen if any node in the cluster is restarted or halted without a correctly configured repository disk.

## Introduction

Without the repository disk, a node cannot join the cluster, so if you reboot any of the nodes without the configured repository disk, you cannot start the cluster services in this node. Next, we show steps to address this situation and bring up the cluster services.

Follow the next steps to recover your PowerHA cluster:

1. Stop the cluster services in every node in the cluster.

Follow this path: smit sysmirror  System Management (C-SPOC)  PowerHA SystemMirror Services  Stop Cluster Services . Select all nodes in the PowerHA cluster as shown in Figure D-1.

```
Stop Cluster Services Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes. [Entry Fields] * Stop now, on system restart or both now + Stop Cluster Services on these nodes               [caa1,caa2] + BROADCAST cluster shutdown? false + * Select an Action on Resource Groups                 Bring Resource Groups Offline +
```

Figure D-1   Stop cluster services

2. Save a snapshot of the cluster.

Follow this path: smit sysmirror  Cluster Nodes and Networks  Manage the Cluster  Snapshot Configuration  Create a Snapshot of the Cluster Configuration (Figure D-2).

```
Create a Snapshot of the Cluster Configuration Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes. [Entry Fields] * Cluster Snapshot Name                              [no-disk-test01] Custom Defined Snapshot Methods                    [] Save Cluster Log Files in snapshot                  No * Cluster Snapshot Description                       [Test01]
```

3. Remove the cluster for every node.

Follow this path: smit sysmirror  Cluster Nodes and Networks -&gt; Manage the Cluster  Remove the Cluster Definition ( Figure D-3 on page 599).

```
Remove the Cluster Definition Type or select values in entry fields. Press Enter AFTER making all desired changes. [Entry Fields] Cluster Name                                        caa_cl * Remove definition from all nodes                   [Yes] NOTE: All user-configured cluster information WILL BE DELETED by this operation.
```

Figure D-3   Remove the cluster menu

Verify that no cluster definition exists for all nodes as shown in Figure D-4.

```
root@caa1 / # cltopinfo Warning: There is no cluster found. cltopinfo: Error reading configuration. -----root@caa2 / # cltopinfo Warning: There is no cluster found. cltopinfo: Error reading configuration.
```

Figure D-4   cltopinfo output

4. Remove and replace the failed disk in the operating system for all nodes.

Remove the failed disk (Figure D-5).

```
root@caa1 / # rmdev -dl hdisk6 hdisk6 deleted -----root@caa2 / # rmdev -dl hdisk6 hdisk6 deleted
```

Figure D-5   Remove the failed disk

5. Use the cfgmgr command to configure the new disk in both nodes. See Figure D-6 on page 600.

## sapci\_cluster: Installing the SAP Enqueue Replication Service (ERS) instance on the second node

For the ERS installation with SAPinst, a virtual SAP host name ( sapcisvc3 ) is used. The advantage is that the ERS processes can be monitored from outside if there is a service address configured. This option is not the default for the Smart Assist; it sets up the ERS without a service IP .

The usual SAP parameters are set as seen in Example E-12.

```
export TMPDIR=/tmp/TC1 mkdir $TMPDIR export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java14_64 ./sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=sapcisvc3
```

## saplc\_cluster: Installing the SAP liveCache in the first node

We performed an SAP installation with a virtual SAP host name. Only the normal SAP parameters are set as shown in Example E-14.

```
export TMPDIR=/tmp/TC1 mkdir $TMPDIR export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java14_64 ./sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=saplcsvc1
```

Example E-14   SAP sapinst environment parameters

SAPinst in the installation DVD provides options when you create a liveCache instance. Important entries are highlighted with the screen captures. You can install the MAXDB database first, but it is easier for SAPinst to install it for you.

Follow these steps:

1. Start the liveCache installation as shown in Figure E-58. Select liveCache Server Installation . The following panels might appear in a different order. It depends on the SAPinst version that you use.
2. Always select Custom installation because you can change the default values. See Figure E-59.

Figure E-58   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 1: Start the database installation

<!-- image -->

Figure E-59   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 2: Custom installation

<!-- image -->

3. In the next window, ensure that liveCache knows whether the Advanced Planning and Optimization (APO) system is Unicode or non-Unicode. Newer installations are only Unicode. If this value is left to the default value, you must manually correct it later. The liveCache ID is the SID that you selected. See Figure E-60.
4. You must set up a master password as shown in Figure E-61. This password is used by all users that the SAPinst creates.
5. If you did not create the users before, SAPinst prompts for the user ID and group ID. This user is the owner of the MaxDB software. These IDs must be the same on both nodes. See Figure E-62 on page 636.

Figure E-60   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 3: liveCache ID

<!-- image -->

Figure E-61   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 4: Master password

<!-- image -->

Figure E-62   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 5: Database user ID and group ID

<!-- image -->

6. This step creates a liveCache administration user at the operating systems level if it does not exist. The profiles of this user are then extended to include the program path that it can access with fundamental commands, such as dbmcli and x\_server . Define the user ID and group ID, which are the same on both nodes. See Figure E-63.
7. SAPinst asks for the location of the liveCache installation DVD as shown in Figure E-64 on page 637.

Figure E-63   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 6: Password for &lt;sid&gt;adm user

<!-- image -->

Figure E-64   SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 7: Location of liveCache installation DVD

<!-- image -->

8. Set the passwords for the superdba and control user as shown in Figure E-65. If you do not change the passwords, SAPinst uses the master password.
9. Set the password for the liveCache access user. This user is the owner of the liveCache database schema. This user and password must be supplied to the APO administrator for integration with APO. APO connects to liveCache through two users. The DBM operator user performs liveCache administration, such as starting, stopping, reinitializing, and tracing. The sql user (this liveCache user) accesses the actual application data.

Figure E-65 SAPinst liveCache installation screen capture 8: Password for superdba and control user

<!-- image -->

If the password is not set to a different value, SAPinst uses the master password. See Figure E-66 on page 638.

- 10.In an SAP liveCache hot standby solution, we must select Raw Devices for the MaxDB/liveCache logging as shown in Figure E-67.
- 11.Select the raw devices for liveCache logging as shown in Figure E-68 on page 639.

- 12.Select the raw devices for the liveCache database. In a production environment, more than one logical volume can exist. Remember that liveCache supports up to 256 logical volumes (for logging and data) and each logical volume can be up to (but not exceed) 128 GB in size. See Figure E-69 on page 640.

## sapdbhr\_cluster: Installing DB2 high availability disaster recovery

The section describes the steps to install DB2 high availability disaster recovery (HADR). Follow these steps:

1. Install the SAP database instance on the first node of this cluster.

We performed a normal SAP installation without the virtual SAP host name. Only the normal SAP parameters are set as shown in Example E-15.

```
export TMPDIR=/tmp/TC1 mkdir $TMPDIR export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java14_64 ./sapinst
```

Example E-15   SAPinst environment parameters

You must perform the same installation steps as described in Step 6. Install the SAP database instance on the first node of this cluster in 7.6.2, 'Installation and configuration steps before you use Smart Assist for SAP' on page 431.

DB2 version 9.7 supports this script set. For the example in this appendix, we installed NW 7.0 with EHP 2 and DB2 9.7 SP4 in this test environment as shown in Example E-16 on page 641.

## Example E-16   DB2 version installed

sapdbhr3:db2tc1 1&gt; db2pd -v Instance db2tc1 uses 64 bits and DB2 code release SQL09074 with level identifier 08050107 Informational tokens are DB2 v9.7.0.4, s110330, IP23236, Fix Pack 4.

## 2. Stop SAP and DB2.

To set up the DB2 HADR feature, you must stop DB2 (Example E-17) and the SAP system.

Example E-17   Stop DB2

sapdbhr3:db2tc1 9&gt; db2stop 04/06/2012 12:10:33 0 0 SQL1064N DB2STOP processing was successful. SQL1064N DB2STOP processing was successful.

3. Copy the DB2 binaries:

root@sapdbhr4 / # cd /db2/TC1 root@sapdbhr4 / # ssh sapdbhr3 tar -cvf - -C /db2/TC1 ./db2tc1 | tar -xvf -

4. Copy additional DB2 files:

root@sapdbhr4 /db2/TC1/db2tc1 # scp -pr sapdbhr3:/var/db2 /var

5. Rename the environment files of the user db2tc1 :

root@sapdbhr4 / # cd /db2/TC1/db2tc1 root@sapdbhr4 /db2/TC1/db2tc1 # mv .dbenv\_sapdbhr3.csh .dbenv\_sapdbhr4.csh root@sapdbhr4 /db2/TC1/db2tc1 # mv .dbenv\_sapdbhr3.sh .dbenv\_sapdbhr4.sh root@sapdbhr4 /db2/TC1/db2tc1 # mv .sapenv\_sapdbhr3.csh .sapenv\_sapdbhr4.csh root@sapdbhr4 /db2/TC1/db2tc1 # mv .sapenv\_sapdbhr3.sh .sapenv\_sapdbhr4.sh

6. Modify the db2nodes.cfg in the local node as shown in Figure E-70:

vi /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/db2nodes.cfg

```
0 sapdbhr4 0
```

Figure E-70   Edit /db2/TC1/db2tc1/sqllib/db2nodes.cfg

7. Update the /etc/services file on the secondary node.

When the instance is created in the primary node, the /etc/services file is updated with information for SAP use. You must add the lines that the SAPinst created on the installing node in the /etc/services file on the secondary node. There are two methods to make these entries available on the second node:

- -The first and the easiest way is to copy the complete file to the second node (with the same timestamp). With this method, you can use it only if both files are the same before the SAPinst starts, and after the SAPinst, only the file on sapsma1 has additional files:

root@sapdbhr3 / # clrcp /etc/services sapdbhr4:/etc/services

This command is better:

root@sapdbhr3 / # scp -p /etc/services sapdbhr4:/etc/services

- -The second method is to add every necessary line on the second node with an AIX command, for example:

root@sapdbhr4 / # chservices -a -v sapgw99s -p tcp -n 4899 -u "SAP System Gateway Security Port"

8. Create the DB2 backup on the first node:
9. Restore it on the second node:

```
su - db2tc1 db2start db2 backup db TC1 to /install/backup compress
```

```
su - db2tc1 db2start db2 uncatalog db TC1 db2 restore db TC1 from /install/backup
```

10.Configure the DB2 HADR on the secondary node sapdbhr4 :

```
su - db2tc1 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_LOCAL_HOST sapdbhr4 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_LOCAL_SVC 61000 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_REMOTE_HOST sapdbhr3 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_REMOTE_SVC 61000 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_REMOTE_INST db2tc1 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_SYNCMODE NEARSYNC db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_TIMEOUT 120 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using INDEXREC RESTART logindexbuild ON db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_PEER_WINDOW 300
```

- 11.Configure the DB2 HADR configuration on the primary node sapdbhr3 :

su - db2tc1

```
db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_LOCAL_HOST sapdbhr3 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_LOCAL_SVC 61000 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_REMOTE_HOST sapdbhr4 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_REMOTE_SVC 61000 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_REMOTE_INST db2tc1 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_SYNCMODE NEARSYNC db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_TIMEOUT 120 db2 update db cfg for TC1 using INDEXREC RESTART logindexbuild ON db2 update db cfg for TC1 using HADR_PEER_WINDOW 300
```

12.Start DB2 HADR on the secondary node sapdbhr4 :

```
su - db2tc1 db2 deactivate DB TC1 db2 START HADR ON DB TC1 AS STANDBY
```

13.Start DB2 HADR on the primary node sapdbhr3 :

su - db2tc1

db2 START HADR ON DB TC1 AS PRIMARY

db2 deactivate DB TC1

14.Check whether the database works in HADR mode as shown in Example E-18.

International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,

* DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

* PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA AND DOCUMENTATION TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.

## 1. Definitions

"Authorized Use" - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units ("MSUs"), Processor Value Units ("PVUs"), or other level of use specified by IBM.

"IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") - a document that provides information and any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at www.ibm.com/software/sla. The LI can also be found in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.

"Program" - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).

## 2. Agreement Structure

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any) and the LI and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee's use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.

## 3. License Grant

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.

IBM grants Licensee a nonexclusive license to 1) use the Program up to the Authorized Use specified in the invoice, 2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use, and 3) make a backup copy, all provided that

- a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;
- b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;
- c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;
- d. Licensee ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee's behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;
- e. Licensee does not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile,

otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program's components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; and

- f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item "f," a "Supporting Program" is a Program that is part of another IBM Program ("Principal Program") and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program's LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)

This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.

3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches

- 3.1.1 Trade-ups

If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program's license is promptly terminated.

- 3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches

When Licensee obtains an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.

## 3.2 Fixed Term Licenses

If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee's license is terminated at the end of the fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.

- 3.3 Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated.

IBM may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee's copies of the Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to both parties' respective successors and assignees.

4. Charges

Charges, if any, are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the invoice. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or an authorized IBM reseller in advance and pay any applicable charges.

## 5. Taxes

If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding those based on IBM's net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as specified in an invoice, or supply exemption documentation. Licensee is responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy, or fee for the import into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program outside the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any amount imposed.

## 6. Money-back Guarantee

If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original Licensee, Licensee may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount Licensee paid, if any, for the Program, provided that Licensee returns the Program to the party from whom Licensee obtained it within 30 days of the invoice date. If the license is for a fixed term that is subject to renewal, then Licensee may obtain a refund only if the Program is returned within the first 30 days of the initial term. If Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

## 7. Program Transfer

Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee's license rights and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Program to another party. Licensee may not transfer a portion of 1) the Program or 2) the Program's Authorized Use. When Licensee transfers the Program, Licensee must also transfer a hard copy of this Agreement, including the LI. Immediately after the transfer, Licensee's license terminates.

## 8. No Warranties

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.

SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY LAW. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 8 ALSO APPLY TO ANY OF IBM'S PROGRAM DEVELOPERS AND SUPPLIERS.

MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR PUBLISHERS OF NON-IBM PROGRAMS MAY PROVIDE THEIR OWN WARRANTIES.

IBM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, UNLESS IBM SPECIFIES OTHERWISE. IN SUCH EVENT, ANY SUPPORT PROVIDED BY IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.

## 9. Licensee Data and Databases

To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee's system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM's obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.

Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

The limitations and exclusions in this Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.

## 10.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM's entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to the charges (if the Program is subject to fixed term charges, up to twelve months' charges) Licensee paid for the Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limit also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.

10.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:

a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR

c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

11. Compliance Verification

For purposes of this Section 11 (Compliance Verification), "ILAN Program Terms" means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.

The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.

## 11.1 Verification Process

Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee's use of all Programs is in compliance with the ILAN Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM's applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with ILAN Program Terms.

Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee's compliance with ILAN Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to ILAN Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's business, and may be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.

## 11.2 Resolution

IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the ILAN Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.

## 12. Third Party Notices

The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code ("Third Party Notices") are included for Licensee's information only. These notices can be found in the Program's NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as "Modifiable Third Party Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party code. IBM's service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.

## 13. General

- a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.
- b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.
- c. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.
- d. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations, including U.S. embargo and sanctions regulations and prohibitions on export for certain end uses or to certain users.
- e. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee's business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM's business relationship with Licensee.
- f. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.
- g. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.
- h. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.
- i. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 10.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.

- j. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.
- k. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called "IBM Business Partners") to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to Licensee.
- l. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee's other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.
- m. Both parties agree that all information exchanged is nonconfidential. If either party requires the exchange of confidential information, it will be made under a signed confidentiality agreement;
14. Geographic Scope and Governing Law
6. 14.1 Governing Law

Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Licensee's and IBM's respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.

14.2 Jurisdiction

All rights, duties, and obligations are subject to the courts of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license.

## 14.3 Arbitration

The following paragraph is added as a new Subsection 14.3 (Arbitration) as it applies for those countries identified below. The provisions of this Subsection 14.3 prevail over those of Subsection 14.2 (Jurisdiction) to the extent permitted by the applicable governing law and rules of procedure:

## ASIA PACIFIC

- (1) In Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, and Vietnam:

Disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement will be finally settled by arbitration which will be held in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of Singapore International Arbitration Center ("SIAC Rules") then in effect. The arbitration award will be final and binding for the parties without appeal and will be in writing and set forth the findings of fact and the conclusions of law.

The number of arbitrators will be three, with each side to the dispute being entitled to appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators appointed by the parties will appoint a third arbitrator who will act as chairman of the proceedings. Vacancies in the post of chairman will be filled by the president of the SIAC. Other vacancies will be filled by the respective nominating party. Proceedings will continue from the stage they were at when the vacancy occurred.

If one of the parties refuses or otherwise fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of the date the other party appoints its, the first appointed arbitrator will be the sole arbitrator, provided that the arbitrator was validly and properly appointed. All proceedings will be conducted, including all documents presented in such proceedings, in the English language. The English language version of this Agreement prevails over any other language version.

- (2) In the People's Republic of China:

In case no settlement can be reached, the disputes will be submitted to China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission for arbitration according to the then effective rules of the said Arbitration Commission. The arbitration will take place in Beijing and be conducted in Chinese. The arbitration award will be final and binding on both parties.

## 8. No Warranties

In Austria (and Germany) the following replaces Section 8 (No Warranties) in its entirety, including its title, if Licensee paid a charge to obtain the Program.

## 8. Warranties and Exclusions

The warranty period is twelve months from the date of delivery. The limitation period for consumers in action for breach of warranty is the statutory period as a minimum.

The warranty for an IBM Program covers the functionality of the Program for its normal use and the Program's conformity to its specifications.

IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating environment it will conform to its specifications. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program or that IBM will correct all Program defects. Licensee is responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program.

The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program.

If the Program does not function as warranted during the warranty period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available, Licensee may return the Program to the party from whom Licensee acquired it and receive a refund of the amount Licensee paid. If Licensee down loaded the Program, Licensee may contact the party from whom Licensee acquired it to obtain the refund.

This is IBM's sole obligation to Licensee, except as otherwise required by applicable statutory law.

For the purposes of this section, a "Default" means any act, statement, omission or negligence on the part of IBM in connection with, or in relation to, the subject matter of an Agreement in respect of which IBM is legally liable to Licensee, whether in contract or in tort.

Appendix F.

## PowerHA and workload partition examples

This appendix contains the full screen captures and examples that we used to test the features of workload partitions (WPARs) under PowerHA.

## PowerHA smit examples

We list the full smit windows in addition to the excerpts that we used in Chapter 8, 'Workload partition and PowerHA scenario' on page 487.

## Configuring the resource group in PowerHA

Example F-1 shows the full smit window for the definition of the resource group that we used for 'Configuring the resource group in PowerHA' on page 491.

```

## Scripts that we used for WPARs in PowerHA

We list the scripts that we used for our application named ApplA .

Example F-2 shows the application. Due to the settings that we used in the start and stop script, this script must be placed in the directory /usr/local/bin . The application is a simple loop that creates some echo output. In the start and stop script, we create or remove the control files that keep the loop running or end it.

```
#!/usr/bin/ksh # [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x echo "$(date) \"Program ApplA initiated \" " >> /var/hacmp/log/applA.log echo $(ls -l /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup) >> /var/hacmp/log/applA.log while [ -a /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup ] do echo "$(date) \"Application A is running\" " >> /var/hacmp/log/applA.log echo "on Hostname: $(hostname) \n   uname: $(uname -n) " >> /var/hacmp/log/applA.log sleep 30 done
```

Example F-2   Application script (ApplA)

Example F-3 shows the start and stop script that we used. We placed it under /usr/local/ha . There, we created a hard link of the file name StartA to StopA . This way, we only maintain one file. At the end of this example, we used exit code 888. It can be any number equal to or greater than 1. We used 888 to identify it in the log files more easily.

```
#!/usr/bin/ksh # [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x # Name=$(basename $0 ) if [ "$Name" = "StartA" ] then echo "$(date) \"Application A started\" " >> /var/hacmp/log/applA.log touch /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup nohup /usr/local/bin/ApplA & exit 0 elif [ "$Name" = "StopA" ] then rm -f /var/hacmp/adm/AppAup echo "$(date) \"Application A stopped\" " >> /var/hacmp/log/applA.log exit 0 else echo "$(date) \"ERROR - Application A start/stop script called with wrong name\" " >> /var/hacmp/log/applA.log exit 888 fi
```

Example F-3   Start and stop script for ApplA

Example F-4 shows the monitoring script that we used. If the application is running, the exit code must be 0 . If the application is not running, the exit code must be unequal to 0 . In our example, we used 777, which is easier to identify in the log files.

```
#!/usr/bin/ksh
```

Example F-4   Monitoring script for application (ApplA)

```
# [[ "$VERBOSE_LOGGING" = "high" ]] && set -x # if ( $(ps -ef | grep -w ApplA | grep -vq grep) ) then echo "$(date) : ApplA is running \n" >>/var/hacmp/log/monA.log exit 0 else echo "$(date) : ApplA is NOT running \n" >>/var/hacmp/log/monA.log exit 777 fi
```
