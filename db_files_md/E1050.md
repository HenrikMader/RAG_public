## 1.1  System overview

The Power E1050 server is suited for cloud deployments due to its built-in virtualization capabilities, flexible capacity, and high performance. The model number for this server is 9043-MRX. It features a single enclosure that is four EIA units (4U) and can be configured with two, three, or four dual-chip modules (DCMs). There are three processor options that are available for this server:

-  Twelve cores running at a typical 3.35 - 4.00 GHz (max) frequency range
-  Eighteen cores running at a typical 3.20 - 4.00 GHz (max) frequency range
-  Twenty-four cores running at a typical 2.95 - 3.90 GHz (max) frequency range

A Power E1050 server with four 24-core DCMs offers the maximum of 96 cores and processor cores can run up to eight simultaneous threads to deliver greater throughput. All sockets must be populated with the same processor modules.

## System features

Each processor module that is added to the system offers 16 Open Memory Interface (OMI) slots that can be populated with 4U Differential Dual Data Rate DIMMs (DDIMMs). These DDIMMs incorporate either Double Data Rate 4 (DDR4) or Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) memory chips that deliver a memory bandwidth of up to 409 GBps peak transfer rates per socket for the DDR4-based memory and 819 GBps peak transfer for the DDR5-based memory. With four processor modules, the Power E1050 server provides 64 OMI slots that support up to 16 TB of memory and a maximum peak transfer rate of 3,276 GBps.

Restriction: An IBM Power E1050 can be configured only with DDR4-based memory or DDR5-based memory. Mixing of the two types of memory is not allowed.

The Power E1050 server provides state-of-the-art PCIe Gen5 connectivity. Up to 11 PCIe slots are provided in the system unit with different characteristics:

-  Six PCIe Gen4 x16 or PCIe Gen5 x8 slots
-  Two PCIe Gen5 x8 slots
-  Three PCIe Gen4 x8 slots

The number of available slots depends on the number of available processor modules. For more information about the system diagram, see Figure 2-1 on page 36.

Note: Although some slots are x8 capable only, all connectors in the system have x16 connectors.

If more slots are needed, up to four I/O expansion drawers, either Gen4 or Gen3, 1 with two fanout modules each can be added to the system. Each fanout module provides six slots. With eight fanout modules in four I/O drawers, the maximum number of available slots is 51. It is possible to mix Gen3 and Gne4 drawers within a system.

The PCIe slots can be populated with a range of adapters covering local area network (LAN), Fibre Channel (FC), serial-attached SCSI (SAS), Universal Serial Bus (USB), and cryptographic accelerators. At least one network adapter must be included in each system.

The Power E1050 server offers up to 10 internal NVMe U.2 flash bays that can be equipped with 800 GB U.2 Mainstream NVMe drives or U.2 Enterprise class NVMe drives in different sizes up to 6.4 TB. Each NVMe device is connected as a separate PCIe endpoint and can be assigned individually to VMs for best flexibility. The 10 NVMe bays offer a maximum of 64 TB internal storage. For all 10 NVMe bays to b available, the server must be populated with all four processor cards. With two or three processor cards, the server can be populated with six NVMe devices.

The Power E1050 server does not have internal spinning SAS drives. However, it is possible to attach 19-inch disk expansion drawers that offer SFF Gen2-carrier bays for SAS disks. For more information, see 2.4, 'Internal I/O subsystem' on page 66.

## Dynamic configuration capabilities and virtualization

In addition to extensive hardware configuration flexibility, the Power E1050 server offers Elastic Capacity on Demand (Elastic CoD) to temporarily activate processor cores and memory. Also included is IBM Active Memory Expansion, which uses data compression to expand the available memory for AIX partitions; and Active Memory Mirroring (AMM), which mirrors critical memory segments that are used by the hypervisor.

For optimal flexibility, the Power E1050 server can be integrated into an IBM Power Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity pool, also known as IBM Power Enterprise Pool 2.0. This pool can include Power E1050 servers, Power E950 servers, or a combination of both. Within the pool, a base capacity (of processor cores, memory, and OS licenses or subscriptions) is purchased and available for usage across any servers in the pool.

All additional resources that are installed on the servers in the pool are activated as available for usage. If the total usage of resources in the pool (metered on a per-minute basis) exceeds the sum of the purchased Base Capacity within the pool, the excess usage is billed to the customer. Billing can be either prepaid by purchasing credits in advance or post-paid, with IBM generating a monthly invoice in the latter case. For more information about IBM Power Enterprise Pools see IBM Power Systems Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity: Featuring Power Enterprise Pools 2.0 , SG24-8478,

The Power E1050 server includes IBM PowerVMÂ® Enterprise Edition to deliver virtualized environments and support a frictionless hybrid cloud experience. Workloads can run the AIX, and Linux operating systems (OSs), including the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. IBM i is not a supported OS on the Power E1050 server.

The Power E1050 server also provides strong resiliency characteristics, which include Power10 chip capabilities and memory protection. The new 4U DDIMMS that are used in the Power E1050 server offer an enhanced buffer, N+1 voltage regulation, and spare dynamic RAM (DRAM) technology. Also, technologies like Chipkill with advanced error correction code (ECC) protection are included, and transparent Power10 memory encryption with no performance impact. This technology is the same enterprise class technology that is used in the Power E1080 server.

Other resiliency features that are available in the Power E1050 server are hot-plug NVMe bays, hot-plug PCIe slots, redundant and hot-plug power supplies, hot-plug redundant cooling fans, hot-plug Time of Day battery, and even highly resilient architecture for power regulators.

## 1.2  Operating environment


Note: IBM does not recommend operation above 27 Â°C, but you can expect full performance up to 35 Â°C for these systems. Above 35 Â°C, the system is capable of operating, but possible reductions in performance might occur to preserve the integrity of the system components. Above 40 Â°C, there might be reliability concerns for components within the system.

Environmental assessment: The IBM Systems Energy Estimator tool can provide more accurate information about the power consumption and thermal output of systems that are based on a specific configuration, including adapters and I/O expansion drawers.

Note: The derate maximum allowable dry-bulb temperature is 1Â°C (1.8Â°F) per 175 m (574 ft) above 900 m (2,953 ft), with up to a maximum allowable elevation of 3050 m (10,000 ft).

Government regulations, such as those prescribed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or European Community Directives, may govern noise level exposure in the workplace, which might apply to you and your server installation. The Power E1050 is available with an optional acoustical door feature that can help reduce the noise that is emitted from this system.

The actual sound pressure levels in your installation depend upon various factors, including the number of racks in the installation, the size, materials, and configuration of the room where you designate the racks to be installed, the noise levels from other equipment, the ambient room temperature, and employees' location in relation to the equipment.

Compliance with such government regulations also depends on many more factors, including the duration of employees' exposure and whether employees wear hearing protection. As a best practice, consult with qualified experts in this field to determine whether you are in compliance with the applicable regulations.

## 1.3  Physical package

The system node requires 4U and the PCIe I/O expansion drawer requires 4U. Thus, a single-enclosure system with one PCIe I/O expansion drawer requires 8U.

Table 1-4 lists the physical dimensions of the system node and the PCIe I/O Expansion Drawer.

Table 1-4   Physical dimensions of the system node and the PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer

| Dimension   | Power E1050 system node         | PCIe I/O expansion drawer         |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Width       | 448 mm (17.6 in.)               | 448 mm (17.6 in.)                 |
| Depth       | 902 mm (35.5 in.)               | 736.6 mm (29.0 in.)               |
| Height      | 175 mm (6.9 in.) four EIA units | 177.8 mm (7.0 in.) four EIA units |
| Weight      | 69 kg (153 lb)                  | 54.4 kg (120 lb)                  |

To help ensure installability and serviceability in non-IBM industry-standard racks, review the installation planning information for any product-specific installation requirements.

Note: The EMX0 remote I/O drawer connection in the T42 and S42 racks stops the rear door from closing, so you must have the 8-inch rack extensions.

## 1.6 PCIe adapter slots

The Power E1050 server has up to 11 PCIe slots in the systems drawer. A mix of PCIe Gen5 and Gen4 general-purpose hot-plug slots can deliver configuration flexibility and expandability. Two adapter slots are PCIe Gen5 8-lane, three adapter slots are PCIe Gen4 8-lane, and six adapter slots are Gen4 16-lane or Gen5 8-lane. All adapter slots are full-height, half-length in size. BSCs are used to house the adapter in the system unit for installation, removal, and service from the rear of the system. All the PCIe slots are single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) capable.

The 16-lane slots can provide up to twice the bandwidth of the 8-lane slots because they offer twice as many PCIe lanes. PCIe Gen5 slots can support up to twice the bandwidth of PCIe Gen4 slots and up to four times the bandwidth of a PCI Gen3 slot, assuming an equivalent number of PCIe lanes. PCIe Gen1, PCIe Gen2, PCIe Gen3, PCIe Gen4, and PCIe Gen5 adapters can be plugged into a PCIe Gen5 slot, if that adapter is supported. The 16-lane slots can be used to attach PCIe Gen3 or PCIe Gen4 I/O expansion drawers.

Table 1-6 shows the number of slots that is supported by the number of processor modules.

Table 1-6   Available PCIe slots

|   Processor modules |   2-socket | 3-socket or 4-socket                   |
|---------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
|                   2 |          6 | x16 Gen5 or four slots  (CAPI-capable) |
|                   3 |          3 | x8 Gen4 slots                          |
|                   2 |          2 | x8 Gen5 slots                          |

## Notes:

-  The PCIe Genx8 slot, C1, is reserved for an Ethernet adapter to help ensure proper manufacture and test of the server.
-  Each NVMe SSD interface is a Gen4 x4 PCIe bus. The NVMe drives can be in an OS-controlled RAID 0, RAID 1 array. Hardware RAID is not supported on the NVMe drives.
-  This server has an energy-efficient design for cooling the PCIe adapter environment. The server can sense which IBM PCIe adapters are installed in their PCIe slots. If an adapter is known to require higher levels of cooling, the server automatically speeds up fans to increase airflow across the PCIe adapters.
-  The terms '16-lane' and 'x16' and '8-lane' and 'x8' are interchangeably used in this case with the same meaning.

Figure 1-6 shows the 11 PCIe adapter slots location with labels for the Power E1050 server model.

Figure 1-6   PCIe adapter slot locations on the Power E1050 server

<!-- image -->

Slot C0 is not included in the list. It is meant for only the eBMC service processor card. The total number of PCIe adapter slots that is available can be increased by adding one or more PCIe Gen3 I/O expansion drawers (#EMX0). The maximum number depends on the number of processor modules physically installed. The maximum is independent of the number of processor core activations.

Table 1-7 list the number of maximum number of I/O drawers per populated socket.

Table 1-7   I/O drawers per populated processor socket

|   Number of processor sockets |   Maximum number of PCI I/O  drawers | Number of fan-out modules   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                             2 |                                    2 | Up to 4                     |
|                             3 |                                    3 | Up to 6                     |
|                             4 |                                    4 | Up to 8                     |

The connection of each fanout module in a PCIe Gen3 or PCIe Gen4 expansion drawer requires the installation of one (#EJ08) PCIe cable adapter that is placed in one of the PCIe x16 adapter slots of the system unit. For more information about I/O expansion drawers, see 2.4.4, 'Attachment of I/O-drawers' on page 72 and 3.9, 'External IO subsystems' on page 101.

## 1.7  Operating system support

The Power E1050 server supports AIX and Linux OSs, and includes support for Red Hat OpenShift. In addition, VIOS can be installed in a special logical partition (LPAR) where its primary function is to host physical I/O adapters, such as network and storage connectivity, and provide virtualized I/O devices for client LPARs.

For more information about the software that is available on IBM Power, see IBM Power.

The minimum supported levels of IBM AIX and Linux at the time of announcement are described in the following sections. For more information about hardware features, see the Power E1050 sales manual page.

IBM Power Systems Prerequisites helps to plan a successful system upgrade by providing the prerequisite information for features in use or that you plan to add to a system. It is possible to choose an MTM (9043-MRX for Power E1050) and discover all the prerequisites, the OS levels that are supported, and other pertinent information.

## 1.7.1  AIX operating system

At the time of announcement, Power E1050 supports the following minimum levels of AIX when installed with direct I/O connectivity:

-  AIX 7.3 with the 7300-00 Technology Level and Service Pack 2 or later
-  AIX 7.2 with the 7200-05 Technology Level and Service Pack 4 or later

At the time of announcement, Power E1050 supports the following minimum level of AIX when installed with virtual I/O:

-  AIX 7.3 with the 7300-00 Technology Level and Service Pack 1 or later
-  AIX 7.2 with the 7200-05 Technology Level and Service Pack 1 or later
-  AIX 7.2 with the 7200-04 Technology Level and Service Pack 2 or later
-  AIX 7.1 with the 7100-05 Technology Level and Service Pack 6 or later

Notes: AIX 7.1 has been withdrawn from marketing since November 2021. AIX 7.2 is the minimum available version for a new software order.

AIX 7.1 instances must run in an LPAR in IBM Power8Â® compatibility mode with a VIOS-based virtual storage and network.

AIX 7.2 instances can use both physical and virtual I/O adapters, but must run in an LPAR in IBM Power9 compatibility mode.

AIX 7.3 instances can use both physical and virtual I/O adapters, and can run in an LPAR in native Power10 mode.

IBM periodically releases maintenance packages (service packs (SPs) or technology levels (TLs)) for the AIX OS. For more information about these packages, and downloading and obtaining the installation packages, see Fix Central.

The Service Update Management Assistant (SUMA), which can help you automate the task of checking and downloading OS downloads, is part of the base OS. For more information about the suma command, see IBM Documentation.

The AIX OS software is available to order in the following editions:

-  AIX Standard Edition: Stand-alone AIX OS only.
-  AIX Enterprise Edition: The AIX OS plus the bundled Power software stack.
-  IBM Private Cloud Edition with AIX7: An enhanced set from the AIX Enterprise Edition of the bundled software stack intended for private cloud usage. For the list of offered software that is included, see 1.9, 'IBM Power solutions' on page 29.

## Subscription licensing model

AIX Standard Edition, AIX Enterprise Edition, and IBM Private Cloud Edition with AIX are also available under a subscription licensing model that provides access to an IBM software maintenance for a specified subscription term (1 or 3 years). The subscription term begins on the start date and ends on the expiration date, which is reflected at the IBM ESS website.

Customers are licensed to run the product through the expiration date of the 1- or 3-year subscription term, and then can renew the subscription at the end of it to continue using the product. This model provides flexible and predictable pricing over a specific term, with lower upfront costs of acquisition.

Another benefit of this model is that the licenses are customer number entitled, which means that they are not tied to a specific hardware serial number as with a standard license grant. Therefore, the licenses can be moved between on-premises and cloud if needed, something that is becoming more of a requirement with hybrid workloads.

The product IDs for the subscription licenses are listed in Table 1-8.

Table 1-8   Subscription license product IDs (1- or 3-year terms)

| Product ID   | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 5765-2B1     | IBM AIX 7 Standard Edition Subscription 7.3.0            |
| 5765-2E1     | IBM AIX Enterprise Edition Subscription 1.8.0            |
| 5765-2C1     | IBM Private Cloud Edition with AIX 7 Subscription 1.8.0  |
| 5765-6C1     | IBM Private Cloud Edition Subscription 8.0 (without AIX) |

The subscription licenses are orderable through an IBM configurator. The standard AIX license grant and monthly term licenses for standard edition are still available.

## 1.7.2 Linux operating system distributions

Linux is an open-source, cross-platform OS that runs on numerous platforms from embedded systems to mainframe computers. It provides an UNIX like implementation across many computer architectures.

The following Linux distributions are supported on the Power E1050 server model.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux

The latest version of the RHEL distribution from Red Hat is supported in native Power10 mode, allowing it to access all the features of the Power10 processor and platform.

At the time of announcement, the Power E1050 server supports the following minimum levels of the RHEL OS:

-  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for Power Little Endian (LE) or later
-  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 for Power LE or later
-  Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for Power LE or later

Note: RHEL 9.0 for Power LE or later is supported to run once it is announced.

RHEL is sold on a subscription basis, with initial subscriptions and support that are available for 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years. Support is available either directly from Red Hat or from IBM Technical Support Services. An RHEL 8 for Power LE unit subscription covers up to four cores and up to four LPARs, and the subscription can be stacked to cover more cores and LPARs.

When a client orders RHEL from IBM, a subscription activation code is published at the IBM ESS website. After you retrieve this code from IBM ESS, use it to establish proof of entitlement and download the software from Red Hat.

## SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

The latest version of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution of Linux from SUSE is supported in native Power10 mode, allowing it to access all the features of the Power10 processor and platform.

At the time of announcement, the Power E1050 server supports the following minimum levels of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server OS:

-  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Service Pack 3 or later
-  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Service Pack 3 or later

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is sold on a subscription basis, with initial subscriptions and support that are available for 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years. Support is available either directly from SUSE or from IBM Technical Support Services. A SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 unit subscription covers 1 - 2 sockets or 1 - 2 LPARs, and they subscriptions can be stacked to cover more sockets and LPARs.

When a client orders SUSE Linux Enterprise Server from IBM, a subscription activation code is published at the IBM ESS website. After you retrieve this code from IBM ESS, use it to establish proof of entitlement and download the software from SUSE.

## Linux and Power10 technology

The Power10 specific toolchain is available in Advance Toolchain 15.0, which allows clients and developers to use all new Power10 processor-based technology instructions when programming. The cross-module function call impact was reduced because of a new PC-relative addressing mode.

One specific benefit of Power10 technology is a 10 times - 20 times advantage over Power9 processor-based technology for artificial intelligence (AI) inferencing workloads because of increased memory bandwidth and new instructions. One example is the new special purpose-built Matrix Math Accelerator (MMA) that was tailored for the demands of machine learning and deep learning inference. The MMA also supports many AI data types.

Network virtualization is an area with significant evolution and improvements, which benefit virtual and containerized environments. The following recent improvements were made for Linux networking features on Power10 processor-based servers:

-  SR-IOV allows virtualization of network cards at the controller level without needing to create virtual Shared Ethernet Adapters (SEAs) in the VIOS partition. It is enhanced with a virtual Network Interface Controller (vNIC), which allows data to be transferred directly from the partitions to or from the SR-IOV physical adapter without transiting through a VIOS partition.
-  Hybrid Network Virtualization (HNV) allows Linux partitions to use the efficiency and performance benefits of SR-IOV logical ports and participate in mobility operations, such as active and inactive Live Partition Mobility (LPM) and Simplified Remote Restart (SRR). HNV is enabled by selecting Migratable when an SR-IOV logical port is configured.

## Security

Security is a top priority for IBM and our distribution partners. Linux security on IBM Power is a vast topic that can be the subject of detailed separate material. However, improvements in the areas of hardening, integrity protection, performance, platform security, and certifications are introduced in this section.

Hardening and integrity protection deal with protecting the Linux kernel from unauthorized tampering while allowing upgrading and servicing of the kernel. These topics become even more important when running in a containerized environment with an immutable OS, such as CoreOS in Red Hat OpenShift.

Performance is a security topic because specific hardening mitigation strategies (for example, against side-channel attacks) can have a significant performance effect. In addition, cryptography can use significant compute cycles.

The Power E1050 features transparent memory encryption at the level of the controller, which prevents an attacker from retrieving data from physical memory or storage-class devices that are attached to the processor bus.

## 1.7.3  Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is supported to run on IBM Power servers, including the IBM Power E1050 server. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a container orchestration and management platform that provides a resilient and flexible environment to develop and deploy applications. It extends the open source Kubernetes project to provide an enterprise-grade platform to run and manage workloads by using Linux container technology.

A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is built from several nodes, which can run on either physical or virtual machines (VMs). A minimum of three control plane nodes are required to support the cluster management function, and at least two compute nodes are required to provide the capacity to run workloads. During installation, an extra bootstrap node is required to host the files that are required for the installation and initial setup.

The bootstrap and control plane nodes are all based on RHEL CoreOS, which is a minimal immutable container host version of the RHEL distribution that inherits the associated hardware support statements. The compute nodes can run on either RHEL or RHEL CoreOS.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is available on a subscription basis, with initial subscriptions and support that are available for 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years. Support is available either directly from Red Hat or from IBM Technical Support Services. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions cover two processor cores each, and they can be stacked to cover more cores. At the time of announcement, the Power E1050 server supports Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or later.

When a client orders Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for Power from IBM, a subscription activation code is published at the IBM ESS website. After you retrieve this code from IBM ESS, use it to establish proof of entitlement and download the software from Red Hat.

For more information about running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power, see the Red Hat OpenShift documentation.

## 1.7.4  Virtual I/O Server

VIOS is part of the IBM PowerVM Enterprise edition feature. VIOS is software that is installed in a special LPAR, which facilitates the sharing of physical I/O resources between client LPARs within the server. VIOS provides a virtual Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) target, virtual Fibre Channel, SEA, and PowerVM Active Memory Sharing capabilities to client LPARs within the system.

The minimum required level of VIOS for the Power E1050 server model is VIOS 3.1.3.21 or later. IBM regularly updates the VIOS code. For more information, see IBM Fix Central.

## 1.7.5  Entitled Systems Support

The IBM ESS website is the IBM goto place to view and manage IBM Power and IBM Storage software and hardware. In general, most products that are offered by IBM Systems that are purchased through IBM Digital Sales representatives or IBM Business Partners are accessed at this website when IBM e-config on Cloud is used.

The website features the following three main sections:

-  My Entitled Software: Activities that are related to IBM Power and IBM Storage software, such as downloading licensed, no-charge, and trial software media; placing software update orders; and managing software keys.
-  My Entitled Hardware: Activities that are related to IBM Power and IBM Storage hardware, such as renewing Update Access Keys (UAKs); buying and using Elastic CoD; assigning or buying credits for new and existing pools in Enterprise Pools 2.0; downloading Storage CoD codes; and managing Hybrid Capacity credits.
-  My Inventory: Activities that are related to IBM Power and IBM Storage inventory, such as browsing software licenses, software maintenance, and hardware inventory; or managing inventory retrievals by using Base Composer or generating several types of reports.

For initial access and to get more information, see IBM ESS.

Note: A valid registered IBMid is required before a user can sign in to IBM ESS.

## 1.7.6  Update Access Keys

UAKs are a technology that was introduced with Power8 servers and adapted by the IBM Power9 and Power10 servers. An UAK is an important parameter that is first validated by the system before an update can proceed.

UAKs have two types:

-  System firmware UAK: This UAK is checked when system firmware updates are applied to the system. The UAK includes an expiration date. System firmware updates contain a release date. When attempting to apply a system firmware update, if the release date for the firmware updates has passed the expiration date for the UAK, the updates are not processed. As UAKs expire, they must be replaced by using either the HMC or the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) on the service processor.
-  AIX UAK: This UAK checks for an active Software Maintenance Agreement (SWMA) when updating the AIX OS. The server uses an AIX update that includes the expiration date for the associated SWMA agreement. The server periodically checks and informs the administrator about AIX UAKs that are about to expire, that have expired, or that are missing. The AIX UAK is a CoD code. There is a single AIX UAK per server (not one per LPAR). As the AIX UAK expires, it must be replaced by using either the HMC or ASMI GUI.

By default, newly delivered systems include an UAK that often expires after 3 years.

Thereafter, the UAK can be extended every 6 months, but only if an IBM maintenance contract exists. The contract can be verified at the IBM ESS website (see 1.7.5, 'Entitled Systems Support' on page 19).

Figure 1-7 shows an example of viewing the system firmware UAK in the HMC.

Figure 1-7   UAK view from the HMC

<!-- image -->

Figure 1-8 shows another example of viewing the access key in ASMI.

Figure 1-8   Access key view from the ASMI

<!-- image -->

## 1.8  Hardware Management Console overview

The HMC can be a hardware appliance or virtual appliance that can be used to configure and manage your systems. The HMC connects to one or more managed systems and provides capabilities for the following primary functions:

-  Systems Management functions, such as power off, power on, system settings, CoD, enterprise pools, shared processor pools (SPPs), Performance and Capacity Monitoring, and starting ASMI for managed systems.
-  Delivers virtualization management through support for creating, managing, and deleting LPARs, LPM, and Remote Restart; configuring SRIOV; and managing VIOSs, dynamic resource allocation, and OS terminals.
-  Acts as the Service Focal Point (SFP) for systems and supports service functions, including Call Home, dump management, guided repair and verify, concurrent firmware updates for managed systems, and around-the-clock error reporting with Electronic Service Agent (ESA) for faster support.
-  Provides appliance management capabilities for configuring the network and users on the HMC, and updating and upgrading the HMC.

## 1.8.1 HMC 7063-CR2

The 7063-CR2 IBM Power HMC (see Figure 1-9) is a second-generation IBM Power processor-based HMC.

The 7063-CR2 is compatible with flat panel console kits 7316-TF3, TF4, and TF5.

Note: The 7316-TF3 and TF4 were withdrawn from marketing.

## 1.8.2 Virtual HMC

Initially, the HMC was sold only as a hardware appliance, including the HMC firmware. However, IBM extended this offering to allow the purchase of the hardware appliance and a virtual appliance that can be deployed on ppc64le architectures and deployed on x86 platforms.

Any customer with a valid contract can download this offering from the IBM ESS website, or this offering can be included with an initial Power E1050 order.

The virtual HMC supports the following hypervisors:

-  On x86 processor-based servers:
- - Kernel-based Virtual Machine
- - Xen
- - VMware
-  On Power processor-based servers: PowerVM

The following minimum requirements must be met to install the virtual HMC:

-  16 GB of memory
-  Four virtual processors
-  Two network interfaces (a maximum of four is allowed)
-  One disk drive (500 GB available disk drive)

For an initial Power E1050 order with the IBM configurator (e-config), you can find the HMC virtual appliance by selecting Add software â Other System Offering s (as product selections) and then select either of the following items:

-  5765-VHP for IBM HMC Virtual Appliance for Power V10
-  5765-VHX for IBM HMC Virtual Appliance x86 V10

For more information about an overview of the Virtual HMC, see this web page.

For more information about how to install the virtual HMC appliance and all requirements, see IBM Documentation.

## 1.8.3 BMC network connectivity rules for the 7063-CR2

The 7063-CR2 HMC features a baseboard management controller (BMC), which is a specialized service processor that monitors the physical state of the system by using sensors. The OpenBMC that is used on 7063-CR2 provides a GUI that can be accessed from a workstation that has network connectivity to the BMC. This connection requires an Ethernet port to be configured for use by the BMC.

Note: This section describes the BMC of the hardware HMC 7063-CR2. The Power E1050 also uses an eBMC for the systems management, as described in 2.6, 'The enterprise Baseboard Management Controller' on page 74.

The 7063-CR2 provides two network interfaces (eth0 and eth1) for configuring network connectivity for BMC on the appliance.

Each interface maps to a different physical port on the system. Different management tools name the interfaces differently. The HMC task Console Management â Console Settings â Change BMC/IPMI Network Settings modifies only the Dedicated interface.

The BMC ports are listed in Table 1-9.

Table 1-9   BMC ports

| Management tool                                 | Logical port   | Shared or dedicated   | CR2 physical port    |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| OpenBMC UI                                      | eth0           | Shared                | eth0                 |
| OpenBMC UI                                      | eth1           | Dedicated             | Management port only |
| ipmitool                                        | lan1           | Shared                | eth0                 |
| ipmitool                                        | lan2           | Dedicated             | Management port only |
| HMC task change  BMC or IMPI Network  settings | lan2           | Dedicated             | Management port only |

Figure 1-10 shows the BMC interfaces of the HMC.

Figure 1-10   BMC interfaces

<!-- image -->

The main difference is that the shared and dedicated interface to the BMC can coexist. Each one has its own LAN number and physical port. Ideally, the customer configures one port, but both can be configured. The rules to connecting IBM Power servers to the HMC remain the same as previous versions.

## 1.8.4  High availability HMC configuration

For the best manageability and redundancy, a dual HMC configuration is suggested. This configuration can be two hardware appliances, but also one hardware appliance and one virtual appliance or two virtual appliances.

The following requirements must be met:

-  Two HMCs are at the same version.
-  The HMCs use different subnets to connect to the Flexible Service Processors (FSPs).
-  The HMCs can communicate with the servers' partitions over a public network to allow for full synchronization and function.

## 1.8.5 HMC code level requirements for Power E1050

The minimum required HMC version for Power E1050 is V10R1 M1020. V10R1 is supported only on 7063-CR1, 7063-CR2, and Virtual HMC appliances. It is not supported on 7042 machine types. HMC with V10R1 cannot manage Power7 processor-based systems.

An HMC that is running V10R1 M1020 includes the following features:

-  HMC OS Secure Boot support for the 7063-CR2 appliance.
-  Ability to configure login retries and suspended time and support for inactivity expiration in the password policy.
-  Ability to specify the HMC location and data replication for groups.
-  VIOS Management Enhancements:
- - Prepare for VIOS maintenance:
- Â· Validate for redundancy for the storage and network that is provided by VIOS to customer partitions.
- Â· Switch path of redundant storage and network to start failover.
- Â· Roll back to original configuration on failure of preparation.

-  UAK support.
-  Configures the Virtualization Management Interface (VMI) connection to the Power Hypervisor for the Power E1050 and for the Power10 scale-out servers.

-  Scheduled operation function: In the ESA, there is a new feature that allows customers to receive message alerts only if scheduled operations fail (see Figure 1-11).

Figure 1-11   HMC alert feature

<!-- image -->

Log retention of the HMC audit trail is also increased.

## 1.8.6  Configuring the VMI

Starting with the Power10 scale-out servers and the Power E1050 server, IBM Power servers are migrating to an industry-standard service processor chipset that is known as eBMC. As part of the eBMC transition, the virtualization management communication path was removed from the service processor.

This path is something specific to PowerVM with the HMC. eBMC is based on of the OpenBMC code base, which is platform-neutral. Developers wanted to minimize the number of PowerVM specific functions in eBMC.

The industry-standard service processor communication protocols and the performance of the service processor do not lend themselves well to supporting the virtualization management traffic pass-through like with the FSP in the past. VMI was invented to satisfy the need for a new network connection point for the HMC.

The VMI design is a combination of HMC and Power Hypervisor support for a new VMI network endpoint for handling virtualization management. The service processor now has two IP addresses for each system management network port: one for system management (eBMC), and one for virtualization management (VMI).

Note: Each port also has two MAC addresses, that is, BMC and VMI each have one.

The eBMC IP address is the equivalent of the FSP IP address in previous generations of IBM Power servers. The WebUI, Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces, and others, all use the eBMC IP address. This IP address is the only one that users interact with directly.

The VMI IP address is used for virtualization management. This IP address is the one that the HMC used to communicate with Power Hypervisor for partition management and consoles. Users do not interact directly with this IP address. From a customer perspective, other than having two IP addresses on the service network instead of one, there is no difference from an HMC user perspective.

All traffic between the HMC and VMI is encrypted with TLS by using a system unique certificate.

Figure 1-12 shows a dual HMC connection to the eBMC of an Power E1050 server.

Figure 1-12   Dual HMC connection to a Power E1050 server

<!-- image -->

VMI supports both DHCP and static IP address configurations. After the server is connected to the HMC and configured by setting the access passwords, you may configure the VMI. To configure the VMI, click VMI Configuration in the HMC GUI, as shown in Figure 1-13. In the configuration dialog box, you may switch between DHCP or a static IP address. The default VMI connection setting (not the eBMC connection) for a new Power E1050 server is static, so if you want to use DHCP, you must change the configuration from static to DHCP before you power on the server.

Figure 1-13   VMI configuration of a Power E1050 server

<!-- image -->

Here is a summary for configuring a new server that has factory settings:

- 1. Connect the Ethernet cable from the eBMC port to the internal HMC network.
- 2. Plug in the power cables. The eBMC starts and obtains the IP address configuration from the DHCP server on the HMCs.
- 3. Enter the access password or, if HMC auto-discovers, the default credentials are used.
- 4. The server shows as Power Off, but it is now in a manageable state.
- 5. Configure the VMI to change from static to DHCP, as shown in Figure 1-13.
- 6. Power on the server. The VMI obtains its IP address, and the HMC to VMI connection is established automatically.

## 1.8.7  HMC currency

In recent years, cybersecurity emerged as a national security issue and an increasingly critical concern for CIOs and enterprise IT managers.

The IBM Power processor-based architecture has always ranked highly in terms of end-to-end security, which is why it remains a platform of choice for mission-critical enterprise workloads.

A key aspect of maintaining a secure IBM Power environment is helping ensure that the HMC (or virtual HMC) is current and fully supported (including hardware, software, and IBM Power firmware updates).

Outdated or unsupported HMCs represent a technology risk that can quickly and easily be mitigated by upgrading to a current release.

The IBM Power10 Processor session material that was presented at the 32nd HOT CHIPS conference is available through the HC32 conference proceedings archive at this web page.

## 2.2.1  Power10 processor overview

The Power10 processor is a superscalar symmetric multiprocessor that is manufactured in complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) 7-nm lithography with 18 layers of metal. The processor contains up to 15 cores that support eight simultaneous multithreading (SMT8) independent execution contexts.

Each core has private access to 2 MB L2 cache and local access to 8 MB of L3 cache capacity. The local L3 cache region of a specific core is also accessible from all other cores on the processor chip. The cores of one Power10 processor share up to 120 MB of latency optimized non-uniform cache access (NUCA) L3 cache.

The processor supports the following three distinct functional interfaces, which can run with a signaling rate of up to 32 GTps 2 :

-  Open Memory Interface (OMI)

The Power10 processor has eight memory controller unit (MCU) channels that support one OMI port with two OMI links each. 3 One OMI link aggregates eight lanes running at 32 GTps speed and connects to one memory buffer-based Differential Dual Inline Memory Module (DDIMM) slot to access main memory. Physically, the OMI interface is implemented in two separate die areas of eight OMI links each. The maximum theoretical full-duplex bandwidth aggregated over all 128 OMI lanes is 1 TBps.

-  SMP fabric interconnect (Power A-bus/X-bus/OpenCAPI/Networking (PowerAXON))

A total of 144 lanes are available in the Power10 processor to facilitate the connectivity to other processors in an SMP architecture configuration. Each SMP connection requires 18 lanes, that is, eight data lanes plus one spare lane per direction (2 x(8+1)). Thus, the processor can support a maximum of eight SMP connections with at total of 128 data lanes per processor. This configuration yields a maximum theoretical full-duplex bandwidth aggregated over all SMP connections of 1 TBps.

With the generic nature of the interface implementation, you can use 128 data lanes to potentially connect accelerator or memory devices through the OpenCAPI protocols. Also, this implementation can support memory cluster and memory interception architectures.

Because of the versatile characteristic of this technology, it is also referred to as PowerAXON interface. 4 The OpenCAPI and the memory clustering and memory interception use cases can be pursued in the future, and they are not used by the available technology products at the time of writing.

-  Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) Version 5.0 interface

To support external I/O connectivity and access to internal storage devices, the Power10 processor provides differential PCIe 5.0 interface busses (PCIe Gen 5) with a total of 32 lanes. The lanes are grouped in two sets of 16 lanes that can be used in one of the following configurations:

- - One x16 PCIe Gen 4
- - Two x8 PCIe Gen 4
- - One x8, and two x4 PCIe Gen 4
- - One x8 PCIe Gen 5, and one x8 PCIe Gen 4
- - One x8 PCIe Gen 5, and two x4 PCIe Gen 4

Figure 2-2 shows the Power10 processor die with several functional units that are labeled. Sixteen SMT8 processor cores are shown, but the dual-chip module (DCM) with two Power10 processors provides 12-, 18-, or 24-core for Power E1050 server configurations.

| Processor compatibility modes             | Support for Power ISA of Power8 and Power9   |

The Power10 processor can be packaged as a single-chip module (SCM) or DCM. The Power E1050 server implements the DCM version. The DCM contains two Power10 processors plus more logic that is needed to facilitate power supply and external connectivity to the module.

Figure 2-3 shows the logical diagram of the Power10 DCM.

Figure 2-3   Power10 dual-chip module

<!-- image -->

## 2.2.2  Dual-chip modules for Power E1050 server

Power E1050 can configure a maximum of four DCMs when the 4-socket (4S) configuration is requested. Power E1050 also offers 2-socket and 3-socket configurations. Eight out of 16 memory OMI busses per Power10 chip are brought out to the module pins for a total of 16 OMI busses per DCM.

Eight OP (SMP) busses from each chip are bought to DCM module pins. Each chip has two x32 PCIe busses brought to DCM module pins.

The details of all busses that are brought out to DCM modules pins are shown in Figure 2-3.

## 2.2.3 Power10 processor core

The Power10 processor core inherits the modular architecture of the Power9 processor core, but the redesigned and enhanced micro-architecture increases the processor core performance and processing efficiency. The peak computational throughput is markedly improved by new execution capabilities and optimized cache bandwidth characteristics. Extra Matrix Math Accelerator (MMA) engines can deliver performance gains for machine learning, particularly for AI inferencing workloads.

The Power E1050 server uses the Power10 enterprise-class processor variant in which each core can run with up to eight independent hardware threads. If all threads are active, the mode of operation is referred to as SMT8 mode. A Power10 core with SMT8 capability is named a Power10 SMT8 core or SMT8 core for short. The Power10 core also supports modes with four active threads (SMT4), two active threads (SMT2), and one single active thread (single-threaded (ST)).

The SMT8 core includes two execution resource domains. Each domain provides the functional units to service up to four hardware threads.

Figure 2-4 shows the functional units of an SMT8 core where all eight threads are active. The two execution resource domains are highlighted with colored backgrounds in two different shades of blue.

Figure 2-4   Power10 SMT8 core

<!-- image -->

Each of the two execution resource domains supports 1 - 4 threads and includes four vector scalar units (VSUs) of 128-bit width, two MMAs, and one quad-precision floating-point (QP) and decimal floating-point (DF) unit.

One VSU and the directly associated logic are called an execution slice . Two neighboring slices can also be used as a combined execution resource, which is then named super-slice . When operating in SMT8 mode, eight simultaneous multithreading (SMT) threads are subdivided in pairs that collectively run on two adjacent slices, as indicated through colored backgrounds in different shades of green.

In SMT4 or lower thread modes, 1 - 2 threads each share a four-slice resource domain. Figure 2-4 on page 40 also indicates other essential resources that are shared among the SMT threads, such as an instruction cache, an instruction buffer, and an L1 data cache.

The SMT8 core supports automatic workload balancing to change the operational SMT thread level. Depending on the workload characteristics, the number of threads that are run on one chiplet can be reduced from four to two and even further to only one active thread. An individual thread can benefit in terms of performance if fewer threads run against the core's execution resources.

Micro-architecture performance and efficiency optimization lead to an improvement of the performance per watt signature compared with the previous Power9 core implementation. The overall energy efficiency is better by a factor of approximately 2.6, which demonstrates the advancement in processor design that is manifested by Power10.

The Power10 processor core includes the following key features and improvements that affect performance:

-  Enhanced load and store bandwidth
-  Deeper and wider instruction windows
-  Enhanced data prefetch
-  Branch execution and prediction enhancements
-  Instruction fusion

Enhancements in the area of computation resources, working set size, and data access latency are described next. The change in relation to the Power9 processor core implementation is provided in parentheses.

## Enhanced computation resources

Here are the major computational resource enhancements:

-  Eight VSU execution slices, each supporting 64-bit scalar or 128-bit single instructions multiple data (SIMD) +100% for permute, fixed-point, floating-point, and crypto (Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)) +400% operations.
-  Four units for MMA, each capable of producing a 512-bit result per cycle (new), and +400% Single and Double precision FLOPS plus support for reduced precision AI acceleration.
-  Two units for QP and DF operations for more instruction types.

## Larger working sets

The following major changes were implemented in working set sizes:

-  L1 instruction cache: Two 48 KB 6-way (96 KB total) (+50%)
-  L2 cache: 2 MB 8-way (+400%)
-  L2 translation lookaside buffer (TLB): Two 4-K entries (8 K total) (+400%)

## Data access with reduced latencies

The following major changes reduce latency for loading data:

-  L1 data cache access at four cycles nominal with zero penalty for store-forwarding (- 2 cycles) for store forwarding
-  L2 data access at 13.5 cycles nominal (-2 cycles)
-  L3 data access at 27.5 cycles nominal (-8 cycles)
-  TLB access at 8.5 cycles nominal for effective-to-real address translation (ERAT) miss, including for nested translation (-7 cycles)

Micro-architectural innovations that complement physical and logic design techniques and specifically address energy efficiency include the following examples:

-  Improved clock-gating.
-  Reduced flush rates with improved branch prediction accuracy.
-  Fusion and gather operating merging.
-  Reduced number of ports and reduced access to selected structures.
-  Effective address (EA)-tagged L1 data and instruction cache yield ERAT access only on a cache miss.

In addition to improvements in performance and energy efficiency, security represents a major architectural focus area. The Power10 processor core supports the following security features:

-  Enhanced hardware support that provides improved performance while mitigating for speculation-based attacks.
-  Dynamic Execution Control Register (DEXCR) support.
-  Return-oriented programming (ROP) protection.

## 2.2.4 Simultaneous multithreading

Each core of the Power10 processor supports multiple hardware threads that represent independent execution contexts. If only one hardware thread is used, the processor core runs in ST mode.

If more than one hardware thread is active, the processor runs in SMT mode. In addition to the ST mode, the Power10 processor supports the following different SMT modes:

-  SMT2: Two hardware threads are active.
-  SMT4: Four hardware threads are active.
-  SMT8: Eight hardware threads are active.

SMT enables a single physical processor core to simultaneously dispatch instructions from more than one hardware thread context. Computational workloads can use the processor core's execution units with a higher degree of parallelism. This ability enhances the throughput and scalability of multi-threaded applications and optimizes the compute density for ST workloads.

SMT is primarily beneficial in commercial environments where the speed of an individual transaction is not as critical as the total number of transactions that are performed. SMT typically increases the throughput of most workloads, especially those workloads with large or frequently changing working sets, such as database servers and web servers.

Table 2-2 on page 43 lists a historic account of the SMT capabilities that are supported by each implementation of the IBM Power ArchitectureÂ® since IBM Power4.

Table 2-2   SMT levels that are supported by POWER processors

| Technology   |   Maximum cores  per system | Supported hardware  threading modes   | Maximum hardware  threads per partition   |

- a. Power Hypervisor supports a maximum of 240 SMT8 threads, that is, 1920. AIX support up to 1920 (240 SMT8) total threads in a single partition, starting with AIX 7.3 + Power10.

The Power E1050 server supports the ST, SMT2, SMT4, and SMT8 hardware threading modes. With the maximum number of 96 cores, a maximum of 768 hardware threads per partition can be reached.

## 2.2.5  Matrix Math Acceleration AI workload acceleration

The MMA facility was introduced by the Power ISA 3.1. The related instructions implement numerical linear algebra operations on small matrices and are meant to accelerate computation-intensive kernels, such as matrix multiplication, convolution, and discrete Fourier transform.

To efficiently accelerate MMA operations, the Power10 processor core implements a dense math engine (DME) microarchitecture that effectively provides an accelerator for cognitive computing, machine learning, and AI inferencing workloads.

The DME encapsulates compute efficient pipelines, a physical register file, and an associated data flow that keeps the resulting accumulator data local to the compute units. Each MMA pipeline performs outer-product matrix operations, reading from and writing back to a 512-bit accumulator register.

Power10 implements the MMA accumulator architecture without adding an architected state. Each architected 512-bit accumulator register is backed by four 128-bit Vector Scalar eXtension (VSX) registers.

Code that uses the MMA instructions is included in OpenBLAS and Eigen libraries. This library can be built by using the most recent versions of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler. The latest version of OpenBLAS is available at this web page.

OpenBLAS is used by the Python-NumPy library, PyTorch, and other frameworks, which make it simple to use the performance benefit of the Power10 MMA accelerator for AI workloads.

The Power10 MMA accelerator technology is also used by the IBM Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library for AIX on POWER 7.1 (program number 5765-EAP).

Program code that is written in C/C++ or Fortran can benefit from the potential performance gains by using the MMA facility if the code is compiled by the following IBM compiler products:

-  IBM Open XL C/C++ for AIX 17.1 (program numbers 5765-J18, 5765-J16, and 5725-C72)
-  IBM Open XL Fortran for AIX 17.1 (program numbers 5765-J19, 5765-J17, and 5725-C74)

For more information about the implementation of the Power10 processor's high throughput math engine, see A matrix math facility for Power ISA processors .

For more information about fundamental MMA architecture principles with detailed instruction set usage, register file management concepts, and various supporting facilities, see Matrix-Multiply Assist Best Practices Guide , REDP-5612.

## 2.2.6 Power10 compatibility modes

The Power10 core implements the Processor Compatibility Register (PCR) as described in the Power ISA 3.1, primarily to facilitate Live Partition Mobility (LPM) to and from previous generations of IBM Power hardware.

Depending on the specific settings of the PCR, the Power10 core runs in a compatibility mode that pertains to Power9 (Power ISA 3.0) or Power8 (Power ISA 2.07) processors. The support for processor compatibility modes also enables older operating system (OS) versions of AIX, IBM i, Linux, or Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) environments to run on Power10 processor-based systems.

Note: The Power E 1050 server does not support IBM i.

The Power10 processor-based Power E1050 server supports the Power8, Power9 Base, Power9, and Power10 compatibility modes.

## 2.2.7  Processor module options

The Power E1050 server uses DCMs. The server can be populated with either two, three, or four DCMs. A one DCM server is not supported because it provides only a single PCIe slot. Figure 2-1 on page 36 shows how PCIe slots are connected to processors.

Note: All processor modules that are used in a Power E1050 server must be identical (the same Feature Code).

Table 2-3 shows the processor features that are available for the Power E1050 server.

Table 2-3   Power E1050 processor features

| Feature Code                                                                          | Description   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| #EHC8 Solution Edition for Healthcare typical 2.95 - 3.9 GHz 24-core Processor Module |               |

| 18-core 3.2 - 4.0 GHZ (maximum) processor                                             | #EPEV         |

## 2.2.8 Processor activations

A physical core in the Power E1050 server must be activated to use the core. There are multiple processor activation types that are available.

## Static processor activations

A classical static processor activation allows the permanent usage of the activated cores. For the number of activated cores, IBM generates a key that is integrated into the system for a new, purchased system.

The minimum number of cores that must be activated is one socket. For example, in a server with all four sockets that are populated with the 12-core option, the minimum number of cores to activate is 12.

There are two kinds of activation features: general-purpose and Linux. Cores with a general-purpose activation can run any supported OS, but cores with a Linux activation can run only Linux OSs. The processor-specific activation features for the Power E1050 server are shown in Table 2-4.

Table 2-4   Processor activation Feature Codes

| Processor feature                  | Static activation feature   | Static activation for Linux feature   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| EHC8 24-core module for Healthcare | #EHCA a                     | N/A                                   |
| EPEU 12-core module                | #EPUR                       | #ELBW                                 |
| EPEV 18-core module                | #EPUS                       | #ELBX                                 |
| EPGW 24-core module                | #EPYT                       | #ELBY                                 |

- a. #EHCA activates 24 cores for each feature. You must order #EHCA with each #EHC8 module.

## Capacity on Demand

Two types of Capacity on Demand (CoD) capability are available for processor and memory on the Power E1050 server:

-  Capacity Upgrade on Demand (CUoD) processor activations
- If not all cores were activated, it is possible to purchase more core activations through a Miscellaneous Equipment Specification (MES) upgrade order, which results in another key that can be integrated into the system by using the Hardware Management Console (HMC) or the Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) without requiring a restart of the server or interrupting the business. After entering the code, the additional cores can be used and assigned to LPARs.
-  Elastic CoD (Temporary)

With Elastic CoD, you can temporarily activate processors and memory as full-day increments as needed. The processors and memory can be activated and turned off an unlimited number of times whenever you need extra processing resources.

The Elastic CoD capacity can be ordered by using the IBM Entitled Systems Support (IBM ESS) website or through your IBM Business Partner or IBM sales representative. If the resources are ordered through an IBM Business Partner or IBM sales representative, the following Feature Codes apply for the Power E1050 server:

- - #ECL1: 1-unit AIX/Linux Processor days Midrange systems
- - #ECL2: 100-unit AIX/Linux Processor days Midrange systems
- - #ECL3: 10,000-unit AIX/Linux Processor days Midrange systems

After ordering, the capacity is visible at the IBM ESS website. To use the capacity in IBM ESS, select the system where the capacity should be used and the number of days to generate a code that can be entered into the system by using the HMC. For more information, see the IBM Entitled Systems Support (IBM ESS) website or ask your IBM Business Partner or IBM sales representative.

Hint: On the IBM ESS website, you can activate a demonstration mode. In the demonstration mode, you can simulate how to order capacity and how to produce keys without any real execution.

## IBM Power Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity

In addition to the two CoD offerings, the Power E1050 server supports the Power Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity solution (Power Enterprise Pools 2.0 (PEP2)), which is an infrastructure offering model that enables cloud agility and cost optimization with pay-for-use pricing. This usage model requires the configuration of the PEP2 Enablement feature (#EP20) for the server, and a minimum of one Base Processor Activation for Pools 2.0 feature is needed. The base processor activations are static and permanent. Extra processor resources needed beyond the capacity that is provided by the base processor activations are metered by the minute and paid through capacity credits.

For more information about PEP2, see IBM Power Systems Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity: Featuring Power Enterprise Pools 2.0 , SG24-8478.

Note: The CUoD technology usage model and the Shared Utility Capacity (PEP2) offering model are all mutually exclusive in respect to each other.

## 2.2.9  On-chip L3 cache and intelligent caching

The Power10 processor includes a large on-chip L3 cache of up to 120 MB with a NUCA architecture that provides mechanisms to distribute and share cache footprints across a set of L3 cache regions. Each processor core can access an associated local 8 MB of L3 cache. It can also access the data in the other L3 cache regions on the chip and throughout the system.

Each L3 region serves as a victim cache for its associated L2 cache, and it can provide aggregate storage for the on-chip cache footprint.

Intelligent L3 cache management enables the Power10 processor to optimize the access to L3 cache lines and minimize cache latencies. The L3 cache includes a replacement algorithm with data type and reuse awareness. It also supports an array of prefetch requests from the core, including instruction and data, and works cooperatively with the core, memory controller, and SMP interconnection fabric to manage prefetch traffic, which optimizes system throughput and data latency.

The L3 cache supports the following key features:

-  Enhanced bandwidth that supports up to 64 bytes per core processor cycle to each SMT8 core.
-  Enhanced data prefetch that is enabled by 96 L3 prefetch request machines that service prefetch requests to memory for each SMT8 core.
-  Plus-one prefetching at the memory controller for enhanced effective prefetch depth and rate.
-  Power10 software prefetch modes that support fetching blocks of data into the L3 cache.
-  Data access with reduced latencies.

## 2.2.10  Nest accelerator

The Power10 processor has an on-chip accelerator that is called the nest accelerator (NX) unit . The co-processor features that are available on the Power10 processor are like the features on the Power9 processor. These co-processors provide specialized functions, such as the following examples:

-  IBM proprietary data compression and decompression
-  Industry-standard Gzip compression and decompression
-  AES and SHA cryptography
-  Random number generation

Figure 2-5 shows a block diagram of the NX unit.

Figure 2-5   Block diagram of the NX unit

<!-- image -->

Each one of the AES and SHA engines, data compression, and Gzip units consist of a co-processor type, and the NX unit features three co-processor types. The NX unit also includes more support hardware to support co-processor invocation by user code, usage of effective addresses, high-bandwidth storage accesses, and interrupt notification of job completion.

The direct memory access (DMA) controller of the NX unit helps to start the co-processors and move data on behalf of co-processors. An SMP interconnect unit (SIU) provides the interface between the Power10 SMP interconnect and the DMA controller.

The NX co-processors can be started transparently through library or OS kernel calls to speed up operations that are related to data compression, LPM migration, IPsec, JFS2 encrypted file systems, PKCS11 encryption, random number generation, and the recently announced logical volume encryption.

In effect, this on-chip NX unit on Power10 systems implements a high-throughput engine that can perform the equivalent work of multiple cores. The system performance can benefit by offloading these expensive operations to on-chip accelerators, which can greatly reduce the CPU usage and improve the performance of applications.

The accelerators are shared among the logical partitions (LPARs) under the control of the PowerVM hypervisor and accessed through a hypervisor call. The OS, along with the PowerVM hypervisor, provides a send address space that is unique per process requesting the co-processor access. This configuration allows the user process to directly post entries to the first in - first out (FIFO) queues that are associated with the NX accelerators. Each NX co-processor type has a unique receive address space corresponding to a unique FIFO for each of the accelerators.

For more information about the usage of the xgzip tool that uses the Gzip accelerator engine, see the following resources:

-  Using the Power9 NX (gzip) accelerator in AIX
-  Power9 GZIP Data Acceleration with IBM AIX
-  Performance improvement in OpenSSH with on-chip data compression accelerator in Power9
-  The nxstat command

## 2.2.11  SMP interconnect and accelerator interface

The Power10 processor provides a highly optimized, 32-Gbps differential signaling technology interface that is structured in 16 entities (eight ports that provide two 1x9 xBus). Each entity consists of eight data lanes and one spare lane. This interface can facilitate the following functional purposes:

-  First- or second-tier SMP link interface, enabling up to 16 Power10 processors to be combined into a large, robustly scalable single-system image
-  Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI) to attach cache coherent and I/O-coherent computational accelerators, load/store addressable host memory devices, low latency network controllers, and intelligent storage controllers
-  Host-to-host integrated memory clustering interconnect, enabling multiple Power10 systems to directly use memory throughout the cluster

Note: The OpenCAPI interface and the memory clustering interconnect are Power10 technology option for future usage.

Because of the versatile nature of signaling technology, the 32-Gbps interface is also referred to as a PowerAXON interface. The IBM proprietary X-bus links connect two processors on a system board with a common reference clock. The IBM proprietary A-bus links connect two processors in different drawers on different reference clocks by using a cable.

OpenCAPI is an open interface architecture that allows any microprocessor to attach to the following items:

-  Coherent user-level accelerators and I/O devices
-  Advanced memories are accessible through read/write or user-level DMA semantics

The OpenCAPI technology is developed, enabled, and standardized by the OpenCAPI Consortium. For more information about the consortium's mission and the OpenCAPI protocol specification, see OpenCAPI (Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface).

The PowerAXON interface is implemented on dedicated areas that are at each corner of the Power10 processor die.

The Power10 processor-based E1050 server uses this interface to implement:

-  DCM internal chip-to-chip connections
-  Chip-to-chip SMP interconnects between DCMs in a 1-hop topology
-  OpenCAPI accelerator interface connections

The chip-to-chip DCM internal interconnects, and connections to the OpenCAPI ports, are shown in Figure 2-6.

Figure 2-6   SMP xBus 1-hop interconnect and OpenCAPI port connections

<!-- image -->

Note: The left (front) DCM0 and DCM3 are placed in a 180-degrees rotation compared to the two right (rear) DCM1 and DCM2 to optimize PCIe slots and Non-volatile Memory Express (NVMe) bay wirings.

All ports provide two 1x9 busses, so some ports show two connections. All connections going outside the DCM are 1x9, which is also the case for the ports where only one connection is shown.

For the internal connection of the two chips in one DCM, two ports are available, but only one is used. The used port connects the two chips inside the DCM with a 2x9 bus.

Note: The implemented OpenCAPI interfaces can be used in the future, but they are not used by the available technology products at the time of writing.

## 2.2.12  Power and performance management

Power10 processor-based servers implement an enhanced version of the power management EnergyScale technology. As in the previous Power9 EnergyScale implementation, the Power10 EnergyScale technology supports dynamic processor frequency changes that depend on several factors, such as workload characteristics, the number of active cores, and environmental conditions.

Based on the extensive experience that was gained over the past few years, the Power10 EnergyScale technology evolved to use the following effective and simplified set of operational modes:

-  Power-saving mode
-  Static mode (nominal frequency)
-  Maximum performance mode (MPM)

The Power9 dynamic performance mode (DPM) has many features in common with the Power9 MPM. Because of this redundant nature of characteristics, the DPM for Power10 processor-based systems was removed in favor of an enhanced MPM. For example, the maximum frequency is now achievable in the Power10 enhanced MPM (regardless of the number of active cores), which was not always the case with Power9 processor-based servers.

In the Power E1050 server, MPM is enabled by default. This mode dynamically adjusts the processor frequency to maximize performance and enable a higher processor frequency range. Each of the power saver modes delivers consistent system performance without any variation if the nominal operating environment limits are met.

For Power10 processor-based systems that are under control of the PowerVM hypervisor, the MPM is a system-wide configuration setting, but each processor module frequency is optimized separately.

The following factors determine the maximum frequency that a processor module can run at:

-  Processor usage: Lighter workloads run at higher frequencies.
-  Number of active cores: Fewer active cores run at higher frequencies.
-  Environmental conditions: At lower ambient temperatures, cores are enabled to run at higher frequencies.

The following Power10 EnergyScale modes are available:

-  Power-saving mode

The frequency is set to the minimum frequency to reduce energy consumption. Enabling this feature reduces power consumption by lowering the processor clock frequency and voltage to fixed values. This configuration reduces power consumption of the system while delivering predictable performance.

-  Static mode

The frequency is set to a fixed point that can be maintained with all normal workloads and in all normal environmental conditions. This frequency is also referred to as nominal frequency .

-  MPM

Workloads run at the highest frequency possible, depending on workload, active core count, and environmental conditions. The frequency does not go below the static frequency for all normal workloads and in all normal environmental conditions.

In MPM, the workload is run at the highest frequency possible. The higher power draw enables the processor modules to run in an MPM typical frequency range (MTFR), where the lower limit is well above the nominal frequency and the upper limit is given by the system's maximum frequency.

The MTFR is published as part of the system specifications of a specific Power10 system if it is running by default in MPM. The higher power draw potentially increases the fan speed of the respective system node to meet the higher cooling requirements, which in turn causes a higher noise emission level of up to 15 decibels.

The processor frequency typically stays within the limits that are set by the MTFR, but can be lowered to frequencies between the MTFR lower limit and the nominal frequency at high ambient temperatures above 27 Â°C (80.6 Â°F). If the data center ambient environment is less than 27 Â°C, the frequency in MPM consistently is in the upper range of the MTFR (roughly 10% - 20% better than nominal). At lower ambient temperatures (below 27 Â°C, or 80.6 Â°F), MPM mode also provides deterministic performance. As the ambient temperature increases above 27 Â°C, determinism can no longer be ensured. This mode is the default mode for all Power10 processor-based scale-out servers.

-  Idle power saver mode (IPS)

IPS mode lowers the frequency to the minimum if the entire system (all cores of all sockets) is idle. It can be enabled or disabled separately from all other modes.

Figure 2-7 shows the comparative frequency ranges for the Power10 power-saving mode, static or nominal mode, and the MPM. The frequency adjustments for different workload characteristics, ambient conditions, and idle states are also indicated.

Figure 2-7   Power10 power management modes and related frequency ranges

<!-- image -->

The controls for all power saver modes are available on the ASMI, and can be dynamically modified. A system administrator can also use the HMC to set power saver mode or to enable static mode or MPM.

## 2.2.13  Comparing Power10, Power9, and Power8 processors

The Power10 processor-based systems are using three different processor module packages:

-  SCMs, which are based on one Power10 chip
-  DCMs, which combine two Power10 chips where both Power10 chips contribute active processor cores
-  Entry single-chip modules (eSCMs), which combine two Power10 chips, but all active processor core resources are bundled on one of the two chips

Power E1080 servers use exclusively SCM modules with up to 15 active SMT8-capable cores. These SCM processor modules are structural and performance-optimized for usage in scale-up multi-socket systems.

DCM modules with up to 30 active SMT8 capable cores are used in 4-socket Power E1050 servers, and 2-socket Power S1022 and Power S1024 servers. eSCMs with up to eight active SMT8-capable cores are used in 1-socket Power S1014 servers, 2-socket Power S1022s servers, and 1-socket Power S1012 servers. DCM and eSCM modules are designed to support scale-out 1- to 4-socket Power10 processor-based servers.

- a. Best of class typical frequency range, where the lower limit of the range coincides with the maximum static or nominal frequency.
- b. Static random-access memory.
- c. Embedded dynamic random-access memory.
- d. Only DDR3 memory CDIMMs, which are transferred in the context of a model upgrade from Power E870, Power E870C, Power E880, or Power E880C servers to a Power E980 server, are supported.

## 2.3  Memory subsystem

The Power E1050 server uses the new and innovative OMI. OMI is a technology-neutral memory interface that you use to change memory technologies in a system without changing to other interfaces. The Power E1050 server supports DDIMMs that are based on either DDR5 technology or DDR4 technology, which are plugged into the OMI slots. A maximum of 64 OMI slots are available in a server with all four processor sockets that are populated, with which a maximum of 16 TB of memory can be installed in to the server. In the following sections, the details about OMI and DDIMMs are described in more detail.

## 2.3.1 Open Memory Interface

The OMI is driven by eight on-chip MCUs, and it is implemented in two separate physical building blocks that lie in opposite areas at the outer edge of the Power10 die. Each area supports 64 OMI lanes that are grouped in four OMI ports. One port in turn consists of two OMI links with eight lanes each, which operate in a latency-optimized manner with unprecedented bandwidth and scale at 32-Gbps speed.

One Power10 processor chip supports the following functional elements to access main memory:

-  Eight MCUs
-  Eight OMI ports that are controlled one-to-one through a dedicated MCU
-  Two OMI links per OMI port, for a total of 16 OMI links
-  Eight lanes per OMI link for a total of 128 lanes, all running at 32-Gbps speed

The Power10 processor provides natively an aggregated maximum theoretical full-duplex memory interface bandwidth of 1 TBps per chip.

## Memory interface architecture for dual-chip modules

The DCM that is used in the Power E1050 server combines two Power10 processor chips in one processor package. A total of 2 x 8 = 16 OMI ports and 2 x 16 = 32 OMI links are physically present on a Power10 DCM. But because the chips on the DCM are tightly integrated and the aggregated memory bandwidth of 8 OMI ports already culminates at a maximum theoretical full-duplex bandwidth of 1 TBps, only half of the OMI ports are active. Each chip of the DCM contributes four OMI ports and eight OMI links to facilitate main memory access. Figure 2-1 on page 36 and Figure 2-12 on page 62 show details about the OMI port designation and the physical location of the active OMI units of a DCM.

In summary, one DCM supports the following functional elements to access main memory:

-  Four active MCUs per chip, for a total of eight MCUs per module.
-  Each MCU maps one-to-one to an OMI port.
-  Four OMI ports per chip, for at total of eight OMI ports per module.
-  Two OMI links per OMI port for a total of eight OMI links per chip and 16 OMI links per module.
-  Eight lanes per OMI link for a total of 128 lanes per module, all running at 32-Gbps speed.

The Power10 DCM provides an aggregated maximum theoretical full-duplex memory interface bandwidth of 512 GBps per chip and 1 TBps per module.

## 2.3.2 Differential Dual Inline Memory Module

The Power10 processor-based E1050 server introduces a new 4U tall DDIMM, which has a new OpenCAPI memory interface that is known as OMI for resilient and fast communication to the processor. This new memory subsystem design delivers solid resiliency features, as described below:

-  Memory buffer: The DDIMM contains a memory buffer with key resiliency features, including protection of critical data and address flows by using cyclic redundancy check (CRC), error correction code (ECC), and parity; a maintenance engine for background memory scrubbing and memory diagnostics; and a Fault Isolation Register (FIR) structure, which enables firmware attention-based fault isolation and diagnostics.
-  OMI: The OMI interface between the memory buffer and processor memory controller is protected by dynamic lane calibration and a CRC retry/recovery facility to retransmit lost frames to survive intermittent bit flips. A complete lane fail can also be survived by triggering a dynamic lane reduction from eight to four independently for both up and downstream directions. A key advantage of the OMI interface is that it simplifies the number of critical signals that must cross connectors from processor to memory compared to a typical industry-standard DIMM design.
-  Memory ECC: The DDIMM includes a robust 64-byte Memory ECC with 8-bit symbols, which can correct up to five symbol errors (one x4 chip and one more symbol) and retry for data and address uncorrectable errors.
-  Dynamic row repair: To further extend the life of the DDIMM, the dynamic row repair feature can restore full use of a dynamic RAM (DRAM) for a fault that is contained to a DRAM row while the system continues to operate.
-  Spare temperature sensors: Each DDIMM provides spare temperature sensors such that the failure of one does not require a DDIMM replacement.
-  Spare DRAMs: 4U DDIMMs include two spare x4 memory modules (DRAMs) per rank, which can be substituted for failed DRAMs during runtime operation. Combined with ECC correction, the two spares allow the 4U DDIMM to continue to function with three bad DRAMs per rank compared to 1 (single device data correct) or 2 (double device data correct) bad DRAMs in a typical industry-standard DIMM design. This setup extends self-healing capabilities beyond what is provided with dynamic row repair capability.
-  Spare Power Management Integrated Circuits (PMICs): 4U DDIMMs include PMICs such that the failure of one PMIC does not require a DDIMM replacement.

Note: DDIMMs are also available in a 2U form factor. These 2U DDIMMs are not supported in the Power E1050 server.

Figure 2-10 shows a 4U DDIMM with a plug that connects into an OMI slot.

## DDR5 memory support

IBM Power E1050 initially supported DDR4 memory. In August 2024, IBM introduced DDR5-based DDIMMs for the Power10 server line.

DDR5 DDIMMs offer increased memory bandwidth due to two key enhancements: higher DRAM speeds, and an extra memory buffer port between the OMI memory buffer and the memory. These improvements can result in an up to 50% increase in sustained memory throughput for the Power E1050 compared to using DDR4-based DDIMMs.

Figure 2-11 on page 59 shows the enhancements that are made to the DDR5-based DDIMM.

In DDR4-based DDIMMs, smaller capacities (32 GB and 64 GB) operate at 3200 MHz, and larger capacities (128 GB and 256 GB) run at a reduced 2933 MHz speed. DDR5 DDIMMs maintain a consistent 3200 MHz speed across all capacities.

The inclusion of a second DRAM port in the buffer chip better aligns internal memory bandwidth with external OMI connections. This configuration enables concurrent read/write operations, which reduce latency under heavy memory usage.

As a best practice, use the DDR5 memory features in new system installations.

Important: Each Power E1050 system must have DDR4 or DDR5 memory installed. Mixing DDR4 and DDR5 memory features on the same system is not supported.

## Maximum memory and maximum theoretical memory bandwidth

The OMI physical interface enables low-latency, high-bandwidth, and technology-neutral host memory semantics to the processor that enable attaching established and emerging memory elements. With the Power10 processor-based E1050 server, OMI on Power10 initially supported low-latency enterprise-grade DDR4 DDIMM. In August 2024, IBM announced support for DDR5-based DDIMMS. With one DDIMM per OMI link, the architecture yields a total memory module capacity of 16 DDIMMs per populated processor module (64 with all four modules populated).

The memory bandwidth and the total memory capacity depend on the DDIMM type, DDIMM density, and the associated DDIMM frequency that are configured for the Power E1050 server.

Table 2-7 lists the maximum memory and the memory bandwidth per populated socket and the maximum values for a fully populated server.

## Mixed DDIMM size support

Each processor socket requires at least four DDIMMs (two memory Feature Codes) and can support up to 16 DDIMMs (eight memory Feature Codes). For optimal memory bandwidth, it is a best practice to populate as many sockets as possible with identical memory configurations.

Although you can mix different memory DIMM sizes within a system (excluding mixing DDR4 with DDR5), each socket must have a single memory feature type. The exception is when Feature Code #EMCM is ordered, which allows specific mixed memory configurations behind a socket.

With #EMCM, you can combine 256 GB and 512 GB Feature Codes in specific configurations, such as #EM77 and #EM7J (DDR4) or #EMFK and #EMFL (DDR5) on a single core.

When #EMCM is ordered, eConfig attempts to mix four 256 GB and four 512 GB Feature Codes across as many sockets as possible based on available quantities. Any remaining Feature Codes must be placed according to the standard no-mixing rule.

Using #EMCM provides greater flexibility in memory configuration for your IBM Power E1050 system.

## 2.3.3  Memory activations

To use the physical memory, it must be activated. For that action, the Power E1050 server supports several options.

## Static memory activations

A classical memory activation allows the permanent usage of the activated memory. For the amount of activated memory, IBM generates a key that is integrated into the system for a new purchased system.

The minimum mount of memory that must be activated is 50% of the installed memory or at least 256 GB. Static memory can be activated in the system configuration by using the Feature Code #EMCP for the activation of 1 GB or #EMCQ for the activation of 100 GB.

## Capacity on Demand

Two types of CoD capability are available for processor and memory on the Power E1050 server:

-  CUoD

If you have not activated memory in your server, you may use CUoD to purchase extra permanent memory (and processor) capacity and dynamically activate it when you need it. This goal can be achieved through a MES upgrade order, which results in another key that can be integrated into the system by using the HMC or the ASMI without restarting the server or interrupting the business. After entering the code, the additional memory can be used and assigned to LPARs.

For activating memory in a configuration, use the Feature Code #EMCP to activate 1 GB or Feature Code #EMCQ to activate 100 GB of memory for any OS.

Note: A minimum of 256 GB or 50% of the installed memory must be activated by default.

-  Elastic CoD (Temporary)

With Elastic CoD, you can temporarily activate processors or memory as full-day increments as needed.

The Elastic CoD capacity can be ordered by using IBM ESS or through your IBM Business Partner or IBM sales representative. If the resources are ordered through an IBM Business Partner or IBM sales representative, the following Feature Codes apply for the IBM E1050 server:

- - #ECM1: 1-unit Memory days for Midrange/High End systems
- - #ECM2: 100-unit Memory days for Midrange/High End systems
- - #ECM3: 10,000-unit Memory days for Midrange/High End systems

After ordering, the capacity is visible at the IBM ESS website. To use the capacity in IBM ESS, select the system where the capacity should be used and the number of days to generate a code that can be entered into the system by using the HMC. For more information, see have a look into IBM ESS or contact your IBM Business Partner or IBM sales representative.

Hint: On the IBM ESS website, you can activate a demonstration mode. In the demonstration mode, you can simulate how to order capacity and produce keys without any real execution.

## IBM Power Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity

In addition to the two CoD offerings, the Power E1050 server also supports the Power Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity solution (PEP2), which is an infrastructure offering model that enables cloud agility and cost optimization with pay-for-use pricing. This use model requires the configuration of the PEP2 Enablement feature (#EP20) for the server, and a minimum of a 256 GB Base Memory Activation for Pools 2.0 feature is needed. The base memory activations are static and permanent. More memory resources that are needed beyond the capacity that is provided by the base memory activations are metered by the minute and paid through capacity credits.

Note: For processors, the metering measures used capacity cycles independent of the entitled capacity that is assigned to LPARs. For memory, this process is different. If memory is assigned to an LPAR, it is used from an Enterprise Pools perspective, even when the OS does not use it.

For more information about PEP2, see IBM Power Systems Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity: Featuring Power Enterprise Pools 2.0 , SG24-8478.

Note: The CUoD technology usage model and the Shared Utility Capacity (PEP2) offering model are all mutually exclusive in respect to each other.

## 2.3.4  Memory placement rules

Each Power10 chip requires a minimum of two DDIMMs that are installed. Because each processor socket has a dual-chip module, four (2x2 DDIMMs) must be installed per socket. Because each Power E1050 server requires a minimum of two sockets that are populated, a minimum of eight DDIMMs must be installed. Using the smallest 32 GB DDIMMs, there is a minimum of 256 GB per server in a 2-socket configuration.

The OMI sockets that are numbered as P0-C22 - P0-C95 must be populated in a defined order. Figure 2-12 shows the plugging rules with colors. First, populate the green slots, then the pink slots, then the blue slots, and then the yellow slots.

## 2.3.5  Pervasive memory encryption

The Power10 MCU provides the system memory interface between the on-chip SMP interconnect fabric and the OMI links. This design qualifies the MCU as an ideal functional unit to implement memory encryption logic. The Power10 on-chip MCU encrypts and decrypts all traffic to and from system memory that is based on the AES technology.

The Power10 processor supports the following modes of operation:

-  AES XTS mode

XTS is the xor-encrypt-xor based tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing. AES XTS provides a block cipher with strong encryption, which is useful to encrypt persistent memory.

Persistent DIMM technology retains the data that is stored inside the memory DIMMs, even if the power is turned off. A malicious attacker who gains physical access to the DIMMs can steal memory cards. The data that is stored in the DIMMs can leave the data center in the clear if not encrypted.

Also, memory cards that leave the data center for repair or replacement can be a potential security breach. Because the attacker might have arbitrary access to the persistent DIMM data, the stronger encryption of the AES XTS mode is required for persistent memory. The AES XTS mode of the Power10 processor is supported for future use if persistent memory solutions become available for IBM Power servers.

##  AES CTR mode

CTR is the Counter mode of operation, and it designates a low-latency AES bock cipher. Although the level of encryption is not as strong as with the XTS mode, the low-latency characteristics make it the preferred mode for memory encryption of volatile memory. AES CTR makes it more difficult to physically gain access to data through the memory card interfaces. The goal is to protect against physical attacks, which becomes increasingly important in the context of cloud deployments.

The Power10 processor-based scale-out servers support the AES CTR mode for pervasive memory encryption. Each Power10 processor holds a 128-bit encryption key that is used by the processor's MCU to encrypt the data of the DDIMMs that are attached to the OMI links.

The MCU cryptoengine is transparently integrated into the data path, which helps ensure that the data fetch and store bandwidth are not compromised by the AES CTR encryption mode. Because the encryption has no noticeable performance effect and because of the obvious security benefit, the pervasive memory encryption is enabled by default, and it cannot be turned off through any administrative interface.

Note: The pervasive memory encryption of the Power10 processor does not affect the encryption status of a system dump content. All data that is coming from the DDIMMs is decrypted by the MCU before it is passed onto the dump devices under the control of the dump program code. This statement applies to the traditional system dump under the OS control and the firmware assist dump utility.

Note: The PowerVM LPM data encryption does not interfere with the pervasive memory encryption. Data transfer during an LPM operation uses the following general flow:

- 1. On the source server, the Mover Server Partition (MSP) provides the hypervisor with a buffer.
- 2. The hypervisor of the source system copies the partition memory into the buffer.
- 3. The MSP transmits the data over the network.
- 4. The data is received by the MSP on the target server and copied in to the related buffer.
- 5. The hypervisor of the target system copies the data from the buffer into the memory space of the target partition.

To facilitate LPM data compression and encryption, the hypervisor on the source system presents the LPM buffer to the on-chip NX unit as part of process in step 2. The reverse decryption and decompress operation is applied on the target server as part of the process in step 4.

The pervasive memory encryption logic of the MCU decrypts the memory data before it is compressed and encrypted by the NX unit on the source server. The logic also encrypts the data before it is written to memory but after it is decrypted and decompressed by the NX unit of the target server.

## 2.3.6 Active Memory Mirroring

The Power E1050 server can mirror the Power Hypervisor code across multiple memory DDIMMs. If a DDIMM that contains the hypervisor code develops an uncorrectable error, its mirrored partner enables the system to continue to operate uninterrupted.

Active Memory Mirroring (AMM) is an optional feature (#EM81).

The hypervisor code logical memory blocks are mirrored on distinct DDIMMs to enable more usable memory. There is no specific DDIMM that hosts the hypervisor memory blocks, so the mirroring is done at the logical memory block level, not at the DDIMM level. To enable the AMM feature, the server must have enough available memory to accommodate the mirrored memory blocks.

In addition to the hypervisor code itself, other components that are vital to the server operation are also mirrored:

-  Hardware page tables (HPTs), which are responsible for tracking the state of the memory pages that are assigned to partitions
-  Translation control entities (TCEs), which are responsible for providing I/O buffers for the partition's communications
-  Memory that is used by the hypervisor to maintain partition configuration, I/O states, virtual I/O information, and partition state

It is possible to check whether the AMM option is enabled and changes its status by using the HMC. The relevant information and controls are in the Memory Mirroring section of the General Settings window of the selected Power E1050 server (Figure 2-13).

Figure 2-13   Memory Mirroring section in the General Settings window on the HMC enhanced GUI

<!-- image -->

After a failure occurs on one of the DDIMMs that contains hypervisor data, all the server operations remain active and the enterprise Baseboard Management Controller (eBMC) service processor isolates the failing DDIMMs. The system stays in the partially mirrored state until the failing DDIMM is replaced.

Memory that is used to hold the contents of platform dumps is not mirrored, and AMM does not mirror partition data. AMM mirrors only the hypervisor code and its components to protect this data against a DDIMM failure. With AMM, uncorrectable errors in data that is owned by a partition or application are handled by the existing Special Uncorrectable Error (SUE) handling methods in the hardware, firmware, and OS.

SUE handling prevents an uncorrectable error in memory or cache from immediately causing the system to stop. Rather, the system tags the data and determines whether it will be used again. If the error is irrelevant, it does not force a checkstop. If the data is used, termination can be limited to the program/kernel or hypervisor owning the data, or freeze of the I/O adapters that are controlled by an I/O hub controller if data must be transferred to an I/O device.

## 2.4  Internal I/O subsystem

The internal I/O subsystem of the Power E1050 server is connected to the PCIe Express controllers on a Power10 chip in the system. A Power10 chip has two PCI Express controllers (PECs) of 16 lanes each for a total of 32 Gen5/Gen4 lanes per chip and 64 Gen5/Gen4 lanes per DCM.

Each PEC supports up to three PCI host bridges (PHBs) that directly connect to PCIe slots or devices. Both PEC0 and PEC1 can be configured as follows:

-  One x16 Gen4 PHB or one x8 Gen5 PHB
-  One x8 Gen5 and one x8 Gen4 PHB
-  One x8 Gen5 PHB and two x4 Gen4 PHBs

The usage or configurations of the PECs are shown in the notation of the ports. There are two notations, the E-Bus notation and the PHB notation, which describe the split of the PEC. Table 2-9 gives an overview.

Table 2-9   PHB cross-reference to E-Bus notation

| PEC configuration         | E-Bus ports       | PHB                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| One x16 at DCM0           | E0                | PHB0                 |
| Two x8 at DCM0            | E0A and E0B       | PHB0 and PHB1        |
| One x8 and two x4 at DCM0 | E0A, E0B, and E0C | PHB0, PHB1, and PHB2 |
| One x16 at DCM1           | E1                | PHB3                 |
| Two x8 at DCM1            | E1A and E1B       | PHB3 and PHB4        |
| One x8 and two x4 at DCM1 | E1A, E1B, and E1C | PHB3, PHB4, and PHB5 |

Figure 2-14 on page 67 shows a diagram of the I/O subsystem of the Power E1050 server. The left (front) DCM0 and DCM3 are placed in a 180-degrees rotation compared to the two right (rear) DCM1 and DCM2 to optimize PCIe slots and NVMe bay wirings.

Figure 2-14   Power E1050 I/O subsystem diagram

<!-- image -->

On the left (front) side, you find 10 NVMe bays. Six NVMe bays are connected to DCM0 and four NVMe bays are connected to DCM3. To make all 10 NVMe bays available, all four processor sockets must be populated. The NVMe bays are connected mainly by using a x8 PHB, some with a x4 PHB. But because the NVMe devices can use four lanes (x4), this fact is not relevant from a performance point of view.

On the right (rear) side, you find 11 PCIe slots in a different manner. Six slots use up to 16 lanes (x16) and can operate either in PCI Gen4 x16 mode or in Gen5 x8 mode. The remaining five slots are connected with eight lanes. Two of them are Gen5 x8, and three of them are Gen4 x8. In a 2-socket processor configuration, seven slots are available for use (P0-C1 and P0-C6 to P0-C11). To make all the slots available, at least three processor sockets must be populated.

The x16 slots can provide up to twice the bandwidth of x8 slots because they offer twice as many PCIe lanes. PCIe Gen5 slots can support up to twice the bandwidth of a PCIe Gen4 slot, and PCIe Gen4 slots can support up to twice the bandwidth of a PCIe Gen3 slot, assuming an equivalent number of PCIe lanes.

Note: Although some slots provide a x8 connection only, all slots have an x16 connector.

All PCIe slots support hot-plug adapter installation and maintenance and enhanced error handling (EEH). PCIe EEH-enabled adapters respond to a special data packet that is generated from the affected PCIe slot hardware by calling system firmware, which examines the affected bus, allows the device driver to reset it, and continues without a system restart. For Linux, EEH support extends to the most devices, although some third-party PCI devices might not provide native EEH support.

All PCIe adapter slots support hardware-backed network virtualization through single-root IO virtualization (SR-IOV) technology. Configuring an SR-IOV adapter into SR-IOV shared mode might require more hypervisor memory. If sufficient hypervisor memory is not available, the request to move to SR-IOV shared mode fails. The user is instructed to free extra memory and try the operation again.

The server PCIe slots are allocated DMA space by using the following algorithm:

-  All slots are allocated a 2 GB default DMA window.
-  All I/O adapter slots (except the embedded Universal Serial Bus (USB)) are allocated Dynamic DMA Window (DDW) capability based on installed platform memory. DDW capability is calculated assuming 4 K I/O mappings:
- - The slots are allocated 64 GB of DDW capability.
- - Slots can be enabled with Huge Dynamic DMA Window (HDDW) capability by using the I/O Adapter Enlarged Capacity setting in the ASMI.
- - HDDW-enabled slots are allocated enough DDW capability to map all installed platform memory by using 64 K I/O mappings.
- - Slots that are HDDW-enabled are allocated the larger of the calculated DDW capability or HDDW capability.

The Power E1050 server is smarter about energy efficiency when cooling the PCIe adapter environment. It senses which IBM PCIe adapters are installed in their PCIe slots, and if an adapter requires higher levels of cooling, they automatically speed up fans to increase airflow across the PCIe adapters. Faster fans increase the sound level of the server. Higher wattage PCIe adapters include the PCIe3 serial-attached SCSI (SAS) adapters and solid-state drive (SSD)/flash PCIe adapters (#EJ10, #EJ14, and #EJ0J).

## USB ports

The first DCM (DCM0) also hosts the USB controller that is connected by using four PHBs, although the USB controller uses only one lane. DCM0 provides four USB 3.0 ports, with two in the front and two in the back. The two front ports provide up to 1.5 A USB current, mainly to support the external USB DVD (Feature Code EUA5). The two rear USB ports' capacity is 0.9 A.

Note: The USB controller is placed on the trusted platform module (TPM) card because of space reasons.

Some customers require that USB ports must be deactivated for security reasons. You can achieve this task by using the ASMI menu. For more information, see 2.6.1, 'Managing the system by using the ASMI GUI' on page 74.

## 2.4.1  PCIe adapter slot details

The PCIe adapter slots have different characteristics. Table 2-10 on page 69 lists the PCIe adapter slot locations, the slot type, the connection to the processor, the OpenCAPI capability, the support to host a PCIe Gen4 cable card (#EJ2A) to attach the EMX0 PCIe Gen3 I/O expansion drawer, and the I/O adapter enlarged capacity enablement order.

- a. Enabling the I/O adapter enlarged capacity option affects only Linux partitions.
- b. Only used for an eBMC card.
- c. P0-C1 is used for the base Ethernet adapter.

The following characteristics are not part of the table because they apply for all slots:

-  All slots are SR-IOV capable.
-  All slots have an x16 connector, although some provide only a x8 connection.
-  All PCIe adapters are installed in an I/O blind-swap cassette (BSC) as the basis for concurrent maintenance. For more information, see 2.4.2, 'I/O blind-swap cassettes' on page 70.
-  All I/O cassettes can hold Half Length Full Height (HLFH) and Half Length Half Height (HLHH) PCIe adapters.

Figure 2-15 shows the rear view of the Power E1050 server with the location codes for the PCIe adapter slots.

Figure 2-15   Rear view of a Power E1050 server with PCIe slots location codes

<!-- image -->

Note: Slot P0-C0 is not a PCIe slot; instead, it holds a special I/O Cassette for the eBMC Service Processor Card.

## 2.4.2  I/O blind-swap cassettes

The Power E1050 server supports I/O BSCs for the hot-plugging of PCIe adapters. PCIe adapters are installed inside a BSC before inserting it into the system from the rear. Each BSC has one x16 PCIe connector. There is always a BCS in each slot (C1 - C11), either with an adapter or a blank. All PCIe slots C1 - C11 are concurrently maintainable by using a BCS.

Caution: To hot plug a BCS, first go to the HMC or AIX diag to start a hot-plug action to remove the power from a slot. Do not pull a cassette when the slot is still under power.

Slot C0 is a special I/O cassette for the eBMC Service Processor card. The eBMC card is not concurrently maintainable. For more information, see 2.4.5, 'System ports' on page 72.

Figure 2-16 is an illustration of the BCS. The Power E1050 I/O BSC is like the one for the Power E950 server, but it has an impel backplane connector to support Gen4 PCIe. Its lock latch is redesigned to include initial turns before engaging the BCS to make the latch more robust.

Figure 2-16   Power E1050 blind-swap cassette

<!-- image -->

## 2.4.3  Non-volatile Memory Express bays

The IBM Power E1050 server has a 10-NVMe backplane that is always present in the server. It offers up to 10 NVMe bays with all four processor sockets that are populated and six NVMe bays if only two or three processor sockets are populated. It connects to the system board through three Molex Impact connectors and a power connector. There is no cable between the NVMe backplane and the system board.

The wiring strategy and backplane materials are chosen to help ensure Gen4 signaling to all NVMe drives. All NVMe connectors are PCIe Gen4 connectors. For more information about the internal connection of the NVMe bays to the processor chips, see Figure 2-14 on page 67.

Each NVMe interface is a Gen4 x4 PCIe bus. The NVMe drives can be in an OS-controlled RAID array. A hardware RAID is not supported on the NVMe drives. The NVMe thermal design supports 18 W for 15-mm NVMe drives and 12 W for 7-mm NVMe drives.

For more information about the available NVMe drives and how to plug the drives for best availability, see 3.5, 'Internal storage' on page 94.

## 2.4.4 Attachment of I/O-drawers

The Power E1050 server can expand the number of its I/O slots by using I/O Expansion Drawers. The original I/O Expansion Drawer (#EMX0) was a PCIe Gen3 drawer. An extra PCIe Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawer (#ENZ0) is now available. It supports both PCIe Gen3 and PCIe Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawers that are attached to the same system.

The number of I/O drawers that can be attached to an Power E1050 server depends on the number of populated processor slots, which changes the number of available internal PCIe slots of the server, and the type of I/O Expansion Drawer. Only some slots can be used to attach an I/O Expansion Drawer by using the #EJ2A CXP Converter adapter, also referred to as a cable card.

Feature Code #EJ2A is an IBM designed PCIe Gen4 x16 cable card. It is the only supported cable card to attach fanout modules of an I/O Expansion Drawer in the Power E1050 server. Previous cards from a Power E950 server cannot be used. Feature Code #EJ2A supports copper and optical cables for the attachment of a fanout module.

For more information about the I/O Expansion Drawers, see 3.9.1, 'PCIe Gen4 I/O expansion drawer' on page 102 and 3.9.2, 'PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer' on page 105.

## 2.4.5 System ports

The Power E1050 server has two 1-Gbit Ethernet ports and two USB 2.0 ports to connect to the eBMC service processor. The two eBMC Ethernet ports are used to connect one or two HMCs. There are no other HMC ports, as in servers that have a Flexible Service Processor (FSP). The eBMC USB ports can be used for a firmware update from a USB stick.

The two eBMC Ethernet ports are connected by using four PCIe lanes each, although the eBMC Ethernet controllers need only one lane. The connection is provided by the DCM0, one from each Power10 chip. For more information, see Figure 2-14 on page 67.

The eBMC module with its two eBMC USB ports also is connected to the DCM0 at chip 0 by using a x4 PHB, although the eBMC module uses only one lane.

For more information about attaching an Power E1050 server to an HMC, see Accessing the eBMC so that you can manage the system.

For more information about how to do a firmware update by using the eBMC USB ports, see Installing the server firmware on the service processor or eBMC through a USB port.

## 2.6  The enterprise Baseboard Management Controller

The Power E1050 server and the Power10 scale-out systems use an eBMC for system service management, monitoring, maintenance, and control. The eBMC also provides access to the system event log (SEL) files. The eBMC is a specialized service processor that monitors the physical state of the system by using sensors. A system administrator or service representative can communicate with the eBMC through an independent connection.

## 2.6.1  Managing the system by using the ASMI GUI

The ASMI is the GUI to the eBMC. It is similar in terms of its function to the ASMI of FSP-managed servers (for example, the Power E1080 server), but it is a complete redesign of the UI driven through customer feedback of a Design Thinking workshop.

To enter the ASMI GUI, go to an HMC, select the server, and then select Operations â Launch Advanced System Management . A window opens and shows the name of the system, MTM and serial number, and the IP address of the service processor (eBMC). Click OK , and the ASMI window opens.

If the eBMC is not in a private but reachable network, you can connect directly by entering https://<eBMC IP> into your web browser.

Figure 2-17 show the login window for the ASMI.Figure 2-17   ASMI login window

<!-- image -->

The default user when you log in the first time is admin and the default password is also admin but invalidated. After the first login, you must immediately change the admin password, which is also true after performing a factory reset of the system. This policy change helps ensure that the eBMC is not left in a state with a well-known password. The password needs to be a strong one, and not, for example, abcd1234. For more information about the password rules, see Setting the password.

After login, you see the Overview page with server, firmware, network, power, and status information, as shown in Figure 2-18.

Figure 2-18   ASMI Overview window

<!-- image -->

The new ASMI for eBMC managed servers have some major differences and some valuable new features:

-  System firmware updates

It is possible to install a firmware update for the server by using the ASMI GUI, even if the system is managed by an HMC. In this case, the firmware update is always disruptive. To install a concurrent firmware update, you must use the HMC.

-  Download of dumps

Dumps can be downloaded by using the HMC, but if necessary, you can also download them from the ASMI menu.

It is also possible to initiate a dump from the ASMI by selecting Logs â Dumps , selecting the dump type, and clicking Initiate dump . The possible dump types are:

- - Baseboard management controller (BMC) dump (nondisruptive)
- - Resource dump
- - System dump (disruptive)
-  Network Time Protocol (NTP) server support
-  Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) for user management
-  Host console

By using the host console, you can watch the boot process of the server. The host console can also be used to access the OS if there is only a single LPAR that uses all resources.

Note: The host console can also be accessed by using an SSH client over port 2200 and logging in with the admin user.

-  User management
- In the eBMC, it is possible to create you own users. This feature can also be used to create an individual user that can be used for the HMC to access the server. There are two types of privileges for a user: Administrator or ReadOnly. As the name indicates, with the ReadOnly privileges, you cannot modify something (except the password of that user), and a user with that privilege cannot be used for HMC access to the server.
-  IBM SecurityÂ® through Access Control Files (ACFs)
- In FSP-managed servers, IBM Support generates a password by using the serial number and the date to get 'root access' to the service processor by using the user celogin. In eBMC managed systems, IBM support generates an ACF. This file must be uploaded to the server to get access. This procedure is, for example, needed if you lost the admin password and want to reset it.
-  Jumper reset

It is possible to reset everything on the server by using a jumper. This reset is a factory reset that resets everything, like LPARs, eBMC settings, or the NVRAM.

## Real-time progress indicator

The ASMI of an eBMC server also provides a real-time progress indicator to see the operator panel codes. To open the windows that show the codes, select Logs â Progress logs , and then click View code in real time .

## Inventory and LEDs

Under the Hardware status â Inventory and LEDs menu, you find most of the hardware components with their state and an identification LED, and the system identify LED and the System attention LED. You can turn on and off all identification LEDs. Only the System attention LED can be turned off.

It is also possible to display the details of a component, which is helpful to see details such as the size of a DIMM or the part numbers if something must be exchanged.

## Sensors

The ASMI has many sensors for the server, which you can access by selecting Hardware status â Sensors . The loading of the sensors takes some time, and during that time you see a progress bar on the top of the window.

Note: Although the progress bar might be finished, it might take some extra time until the sensors appear.

Figure 2-19 shows an example of the Sensors window.Figure 2-19   ASMI Sensors window

<!-- image -->

## Network settings

The default network setting for the two eBMC ports is DHCP. Therefore, when you connect a port to a private HMC network where the HMC is connected to a DHCP server, the new system should get its IP address from the HMC during the startup of the firmware. Then, the new system automatically appears in the HMC and can be configured. As a best practice, use DHCP to attach a server to the HMC.

If you do not use DHCP and want to use a static IP address, you can set the IP address in the ASMI GUI. However, because there are no default IP addresses that are the same for every server, you first must discover the configured IP address.

To discover the configured IP address, use the operator panel and complete the following steps:

- 1. Use the Increment or Decrement buttons to scroll to function 02.
- 2. Press Enter until the value changes from N to M, which activates access to function 30.
- 3. Scroll to function 30 and press Enter. Function 30** appears.
- 4. Scroll to 3000 and press Enter, which shows you the IP address of the eth0 port.
- 5. If you scroll to 3001 and press Enter, you see the IP address of eth1.
- 6. After you discover the IP address, scroll again to function 02 and set the value back from M to N.

For more information about function 30 in the operator panel, see IBM Documentation.

Now that you have discovered the IP address, you can connect any computer with a web browser to an IP address in the same subnet (class C) and connect the computer with the correct Ethernet port of the Power E1050 server.

Hint: Most connections work by using a standard Ethernet cable. If you do not see a link when using a standard Ethernet cable, try a crossover cable, where the send and receive wires are crossed.

After connecting the cable, you can use a web browser to access the ASMI by using the URL https://<IP address> , and then you can configure the network ports. To configure the network ports, select Settings â Network and select the correct adapter to configure. Figure 2-20 shows an example of changing eth1. Before you can configure a static IP address, turn off DHCP. It is possible to configure several static IP addresses on one physical Ethernet port.

Figure 2-20   ASMI network settings

<!-- image -->

You cannot configure the Virtualization Management Interface (VMI) address in the ASMI network settings. The VMI address is another IP address that is configured on the physical eBMC Ethernet port of the server to manage the virtualization of the server. The VMI address can be configured only in the HMC.

## Using an Access Control File

If you lose the access password for the ASMI service user, you can access the ASMI by using an ACF. An ACF is a digital certificate that is provided by IBM Support when you open a support case. To use the ACF, the system must be enabled at the server by using the operator panel.

Complete the following steps:

- 1. On the operator panel, use the Increment or Decrement buttons to scroll to function 74.
- 2. Press Enter, and select 00 to accept the function (FF rejects it).
- 3. The ACF function now is active for 30 minutes. To use it, access the ASMI login window.
- 4. To upload the ACF into the system and access the ASMI, click Upload service login certificate .

For more information, see IBM Documentation.

## Policies

In the Security and access â Policies menu, you can turn on and off security-related functions, for example, whether you can manage your server by using Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI).

Some customers require that the USB ports of the server should be disabled. You can accomplish this task by using policies. To do so, clear Host USB enablement , as shown in Figure 2-21.

Figure 2-21   How to turn off the USB ports of the server

<!-- image -->

## 2.6.3  Managing the system by using the IPMI

The Power E1050 server can also be managed by using the IPMI, but the IPMI is disabled by default on your server. Inherent security vulnerabilities are associated with the IPMI, so consider using Redfish APIs or the GUI to manage your system.

If you want to use IPMI, you must first enable it. To do so, select Security and access â Policies . Then, enable the policy Network IPMI (out-of-band IPMI) .

A list of common IPMI commands can be found at Common IPMI commands.

## 3.1  Processor module features

This section describes all processor-related Feature Codes for the Power10 processor-based Enterprise Midrange Power E1050 server.

The Power E1050 supports 24 - 96 processor cores. A minimum of two and a maximum of four processor modules are required for each system. The modules can be added to a system later through a Miscellaneous Equipment Specification (MES) order, but they require scheduled downtime to install. All processor modules in one server must be at the same gigahertz frequency (that is, they must be the same processor module feature number).

Table 3-1 lists the processor card Feature Codes that are available at initial order for Power E1050 servers: the related module type, the number of function cores, the typical frequency range in maximum performance mode (MPM), and the socket options.

Table 3-1   Processor card features

|   E1050 Feature  Code |   Processor SMT8  cores | Maximum  system cores   | Typical  frequency range   | Socket options   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
|                    12 |                      48 | 3.35 - 4.00 GHz         | 2, 3, or 4                 | #EPEU            |

|                    24 |                      96 | 2.95 - 3.90 GHz         | 2, 3, or 4                 | #EHC8 a          |

- a. Healthcare solution Edition (North America (NA) only)

Note: IBM intends to support SAP HANA on the Power E1050 after initial general availability (GA). SAP HANA on Power E1050 will be certified with four sockets (4S), 24 cores, and 16 TB of memory. All processor core options, including 12-core and 18-core, will also be offered after certification.

## Permanent Capacity on Demand processor core activations

Permanent Capacity on Demand (CoD) processor core activations are required for the first processor module in the configuration and are optional for the second and fourth modules. Specifically:

-  Two, three, or four 12-core typical 3.35 - 4.0 GHz (max) processor modules (#EPEU) require 12 processor core activations (#EPUR) at a minimum.
-  Two, three, or four 18-core typical 3.20 - 4.0 GHz (max) processor modules (#EPEV) require 18 processor core activations (#EPUS) at a minimum.
-  Two, three, or four 24-core, typical 2.95 - 3.90 GHz (max) processor modules (#EPGW) require 24 processor core activations (#EPYT) at a minimum.

For Linux, the following activation features are available:

-  One-core Processor Activation for #EPEU Linux only (#EPUN)
-  One-core Processor Activation for #EPEV Linux only (#EPUP)
-  One-core Processor Activation for #EPEW Linux only (#EPUM)

For the Healthcare solution edition, the Processor Activation (24) for Healthcare Solution #EHC8 (#EHCA) activation feature is available.

## Temporary CoD capabilities

Temporary CoD is used for processor cores that are not permanently activated.

A Hardware Management Console (HMC) is required for Temporary CoD.

## Cloud solution and dynamic capacity

The IBM Power Private Cloud with Shared Utility Capacity solution is an alternative to the static processor activation use model. It can be used to enable cloud agility and cost optimization with pay-for-use pricing Power E1050 server support.

Both Elastic and Shared Utility Capacity options are available on all Power E1050 servers through the Virtual Capacity (4586-COD) machine type and model (MTM). For more information, see the IBM Entitled Systems Support (IBM ESS) website.

With Elastic Capacity on Power E1050 servers, you can deploy pay-for-use consumption of processors by the day across a collection of Power E1050 and Power E950 servers.

Shared Utility Capacity on Power E1050 servers provides enhanced multisystem resource sharing and by-the-minute tracking and consumption of compute resources across a collection of systems within a Power Enterprise Pools 2.0 (PEP2). Shared Utility Capacity on Power E1050 servers has the flexibility to tailor initial system configurations with the right mix of purchased and pay-for-use consumption of processor.

Table 3-2 lists the Feature Codes for processor activation with PEP2.

## Permanent CoD memory activations

Permanent CoD memory activations are required for at least 50% of the physically installed memory or 256 GB of activations, whichever is larger. Use 1 GB activation (#EMCP) and 100 GB activation (#EMCQ) features to order permanent memory activations.

## Temporary CoD memory activations

Temporary CoD memory activations are available for memory capacity that is not permanently activated. CoD memory activations are available by using Virtual Capacity 4586-COD from IBM ESS. An HMC is required for Temporary CoD.

All the memory activation features are listed in Table 3-5, which also includes the memory conversion Feature Codes.

Memory is ordered in a quantity of eight of the same memory feature.

-  The minimum memory that is supported per two Power10 processors that are installed is 256 GB.
-  The minimum memory that is supported per three Power10 processors that are installed is 384 GB.
-  The minimum memory that is supported per four Power10 processors that are installed is 512 GB.

The E1050 9043-MXR server supports, as an option, Active Memory Expansion (AME) with Feature Code #EMBM, and also as an option Active Memory Mirroring (AMM) for the Hypervisor with Feature Code #EM81.

## 3.3  Power supply features

The Power E1050 server has four AC to DC 2300 W Titanium-classed power supply units (PSUs). The PSUs are concurrently maintainable.

Note: A Titanium-certified (best in class) power supply has an efficiency of 90% - 95% on load. Every 1% efficiency loss at the PSU requires more than 1% more power to accomplish the same output. Efficient power supplies help data centers to achieve their sustainability goals.

The Power E1050 power supplies have 2+2 redundancy. The failed PSU is hot-pluggable.

-  When one PSU is defective during run time, the system continues to run with full performance.
-  When two PSUs are defective during run time, the system continues to run, but might throttle as needed.
-  During boot, the system requires three PSUs to be installed, but powers on with only two good PSUs.

## 3.4  Peripheral Component Interconnect adapters

This section covers the various types and functions of the PCIe adapters that are supported by the Power E1050 (9043-MRX). This list is based on the PCIe adapters that are available on the GA date of these systems, but it is subject to change as more PCIe adapters are tested and certified, or listed adapters are no longer available. The latest list of supported adapters is available at the Announcement Letter or Sales Manual page, which can be found at the IBM Offering Information website.

The following sections describe the supported adapters and provide tables of orderable and supported feature numbers. The tables indicate OS support (AIX and Linux) for each of the adapters.

Note: The maximum number of adapters in each case might require the server to have an external PCIe expansion drawer.

The Order type table column in the following subsections is defined as follows:

Initial

Denotes the orderability of a feature only with the purchase of a new system.

MES

Denotes the orderability of a feature only as part of an MES upgrade purchase for an existing system.

Both

Denotes the orderability of a feature as part of both new and MES upgrade purchases.

Supported

Denotes that a feature is not orderable with a system, but is supported ; that is, the feature can be migrated from existing systems, but cannot be ordered new.

## 3.4.1  Local area network adapters

To connect the IBM Power E1050 server models to a local area network (LAN), you can use the LAN adapters that are supported in the PCIe slots of the system. Several connection speeds and physical connections are supported.

Table 3-6 on page 91 lists the LAN adapters that are supported within the Power E1050 servers.

- a. Check for specific AIX or Linux OS requirements in the E1050 Sales Manual.

## 3.4.2  Fibre Channel adapters

The Power10 processor-based Enterprise Midrange servers support connection to devices that use Fibre Channel (FC) connectivity, either directly or through a storage area network (SAN). There is a range of PCIe connected FC adapters that are available in both low-profile and full-height form factors.

All supported FC adapters have LC connections. If you are attaching a switch or a device with an SC type fiber connector, then an LC-SC 50-Micron Fiber Converter Cable (#2456) or an LC-SC 62.5-Micron Fiber Converter Cable (#2459) is required.

Table 3-7 lists the FC adapters that are supported within the Power E1050 servers.

## 3.4.3 Serial-attached SCSI adapters

The internal storage in the Power10 processor-based Enterprise Midrange servers is based on Non-volatile Memory Express (NVMe) devices that are connected over PCIe directly. You can also connect further storage expansion drawers to the system by using serial-attached SCSI (SAS) connections.

Table 3-8 lists the SAS adapters that are supported within the Power E1050 servers and with the PCIe expansion drawer (EMX0) connected.

## 3.4.5  Cryptographic co-processor adapters

Two different cryptographic co-processors and accelerators are supported by the Power10 processor-based Enterprise Midrange servers, both of which are full-height adapters. These adapters work with the IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) to deliver acceleration of cryptographic workloads. For more information about the cryptographic co-processors, the associated software that is available, and the CCA that is available, see the IBM Systems cryptographic HSMs website.

## PCIe Gen3 4767 Cryptographic Co-processor

A secure-key adapter provides both cryptographic co-processor and cryptographic accelerator functions in a single PCIe card. The adapter is suited to applications requiring high-speed, security-sensitive Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) acceleration, cryptographic operations for data encryption and digital signing, secure management, and usage of cryptographic keys or custom cryptographic applications. The adapter provides secure storage of cryptographic keys in a tamper-resistant hardware security module that meets FIPS 140-2 level 4 security requirements. The adapter is a PCIe Gen 3 x4 full-height short card. The adapter runs in dedicated mode only (no PowerVM virtualization).

This adapter is available only as the full-height form factor, and it is available in two variations with two different Feature Codes:

-  #EJ32 does not include a blind-swap cassette (BSC), and can be installed only within the chassis of a Power E1050 server.
-  #EJ33 includes a BSC housing, and can be installed only in a PCIe Gen3 I/O expansion drawer enclosure.

## PCIe Gen3 4769 Cryptographic Co-processor

The 4769 PCIe Cryptographic Co-processor has a PCIe local bus compatible interface. The co-processor holds a security-enabled subsystem module and batteries for backup power. The hardened encapsulated subsystem contains redundant IBM PowerPCÂ® 476 processors; custom symmetric key and hashing engines to perform Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES (TDES), SHA-1 and SHA- 2, MD5 and Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC); and public key cryptographic algorithm support for RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Other hardware support includes a secure real-time clock, hardware random number generator, and a prime number generator. It also contains a separate service processor that is used to manage self-test and firmware updates. The secure module is protected by a tamper responding design that protects against many types of attacks against the system.

The 4769 PCIe Cryptographic Co-processor includes acceleration for AES, DES, TDES, HMAC, Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), MD5, multiple Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) hashing methods, modular-exponentiation hardware, such as RSA and error correction code (ECC), and full-duplex direct memory access (DMA) communications.

A security-enabled code-loading arrangement allows control program and application program loading and refreshes after co-processor installation in your server. IBM offers an embedded subsystem control program and a cryptographic application programming interface (API) that implements the IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture.

The 4769 PCIe Cryptographic Co-processor is verified by NIST at FIPS 140-2 Level 4, which is the highest level of certification currently achievable for commercial cryptographic devices.

Table 3-10 summarizes the cryptographic co-processor and accelerator adapters that are supported in the Power10 processor-based Enterprise Midrange servers.

Table 3-10   Crypto adapter features for the Power E 1050 servers

| Feature  Code                                                                 | Description                | OS support Order type   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|

| #EJ37 a PCIe3 Crypto Co-processor BSC-Gen3 4769 (PCIe  expansion drawer only) | AIX and Linux  Direct only | Both                    |

- a. Feature Codes #EJ35 and #EJ37 are both Feature Codes representing the same physical card. #EJ35 indicates no BSC. #EJ37 indicates a Gen 3 BSC.

## 3.5 Internal storage

The Power E1050 server includes an NVMe U.2 disk backplane that provides 10 internal NVMe bays. The backplane is always present in the server. A U.3-U.2 configurable disk drive can run as NVMe U.2 mode only. The internal storage subsystem does not support the SAS protocol, so SAS disk drive options are available and supported only by adding one or more external expansion drawers to a Power E1050 configuration that supports up to 64 EXP24SX SFF Drawers (#ESLS).

Every Power E1050 configuration supports single-port NVMe mode only. Dual-port NVMe mode is not supported. Only the Power E1050 4-sockets configuration supports up to 10 NVMe disk drives. Configurations for three and two sockets support up to six NVMe disk drives. NVMe disk drives that are used as mirrors for operating system (OS) and dual Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) redundancy must be plugged according to the rules to help ensure as many as possible separate hardware paths for the dual and mirrored pairs.

Table 3-11 shows the NVMe location codes inside the server.

Table 3-11   NVMe location codes

| NVMe#           | NVMe0   | NVMe1   | NVMe2   | NVMe3   | NVMe4   | NVMe5   | NVMe6   | NVMe7   | NVme8   | NVMe9   |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Location  codes | P1-C0   | P1-C1   | P1-C2   | P1-C3   | P1-C4   | P1-C5   | P1-C6   | P1-C7   | P1-C8   | P1-C9   |

All NVMe disk drives are driven directly from the system backplane, so there is no need to have a PCIe card or cables that are dedicated to this purpose. The 7-mm NVMe disk drives from the IBM Power E950 are also supported on the Power E1050, but you must order the NVMe carrier conversion kit (#EC7X) to hold these drives.

## 3.5.1  Best practice NVMe plug rules

The following NVMe plug rules are best practice to provide the server with the most redundancy in hardware for OS mirror. To verify the sequence of the best practice disk drives positions according to their quantity and the Power E1050 processor configuration (2-, 3- or 4-socket), see Table 3-12 on page 95.

## 3.5.3  RAID support

The Power E1050 internal NVMe disk drives' volume and file systems can be protected in an OS-controlled RAID 0 or RAID 1 configuration. A hardware RAID option is not supported on the Power E1050 by using the internal NVMe drives.

## 3.6 External SAS ports

There are no external SAS ports on the Power E1050 server.

## 3.7  Media drawers

The IBM System Storage 7226 Model 1U3 Multi-Media Enclosure can accommodate up to two LTO tape drives, two RDX removable disk drive docking stations, or up to four DVD-RAM drives in a 1U rack-mountable dual bay enclosure. Up to two drives (or four DVD-RAM) can be installed in any combination in the 7226 Model 1U3 enclosure. The 7226 Model 1U3 offers SAS, USB, and FC electronic interface drive options for attachment to the Power E1050 server. Up to six of these multimedia drawers can be attached.

Table 3-14 shows the drive features for the 7226 Model 1U3.

Table 3-14   Available drive features for the 7226 Model 1U3

| #EU2T          | 2.0 TB Removable RDX Drive                |

Note: Existing 32 GB (#EU08) and 1.5 TB (#EU15) removable disk drive cartridges are still supported on the RDX docking stations.

PCIe3 RAID SAS Tape/DVD Adapter Quad-port 6 Gb x8 (#EJ10) supports Tape/DVD with the following cable options:

-  SAS AE1 Cable 4 m - HD Narrow 6 Gb Adapter to Enclosure (#ECBY)
-  SAS YE1 Cable 3 m - HD Narrow 6 Gb Adapter to Enclosure (#ECBZ)

Note: Any of the existing 7216-1U2 and 7214-1U2 multimedia drawers are also supported.

## 3.7.1 External DVD drives

The stand-alone USB DVD drive (#EUA5) is an optional, stand-alone external USB-DVD device. It requires a high current at 5 V and must use the front USB 3.0 port on the Power E1050 server. This device comes with a USB cable. The cable provides the data path and power to this drive. A maximum of one external DVD drive can be attached. The USB DVD drive is supported by AIX, and it can be assigned to the VIOS.

## 3.7.2  RDX removable disk drives

The RDX USB External Docking Station (#EUA4) accommodates RDX removable disk cartridges of any capacity. The disk is in a protective rugged cartridge enclosure that plugs into the docking station. The docking station holds one removable rugged disk drive/cartridge at a time. The rugged removable disk cartridge and docking station can be used like a tape drive. This feature can be an excellent entry system save/restore option and a good alternative to DAT72, DAT160, 8 mm, and VXA-2 and VXA-320 tapes.

The RDX USB External Docking Station attaches to the Power E1050 server through an included USB cable that carries data and control information. It is not powered by the USB port on the Power server or a Power server USB adapter, but has a separate electrical power cord. Physically, the docking station is a stand-alone enclosure with the dimensions 2.0 x 7.0 x 4.25 inches, and the station can sit on a shelf or on top of equipment in a rack. Up to six of these devices can be attached. The USB DVD drive is supported by AIX and can be assigned to the VIOS. Various disk drives are available, as shown in Table 3-15.

Table 3-15 RDX removable disk drives

| Feature Code   | Description                           |

- a. Supported only. The feature can be migrated only from existing systems.

## 3.8 Disk and media features

NVMe SSDs are used for internal storage in the Power E1050 server. Up to six NVMe drives are supported on the Power E1050 with two or three dual-chip modules (DCMs), and up to 10 NVMe drives are supported on the Power E1050 with four DCMs installed. This NVMe backplane is a base component that is always present in the system. Figure 3-2 on page 99 shows the NVMe wiring to the DCMs.

Figure 3-2   NVMe wiring to the DCMs

<!-- image -->

Table 3-16 shows the reference NVMe topology.

Table 3-16   Reference NVMe topology

| DCM                                                         | NVMe#                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| DCM0                                                        | NVMe 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 |
| DCM3 (only installed on four processors on the Power E1050) | NVMe 0, 1, 5, and 6       |

As a best practice, use the NVMe plug rules that are shown in Table 3-17 for the Power E1050 to provide the most redundancy in hardware for OS mirroring.

For OS NVMe mirror pairs, only an OS-controlled RAID 0, 1 is supported. There is no support for hardware mirroring with the NVMe backplane.

Note: As a best practice, the mirrored two NVMe drives of the pairs should have the same capacity.

Here are the preferred NVMe pairs for mirroring:

-  Mirrored OS: NVMe 3 and 4, or NVMe 8 and 9
-  Mirrored dual-VIOS with four NVMe drives:
- - NVMe 3 for VIOS1, and NVMe 4 for VIOS2.
- - NVMe 9 mirrors NVMe 3, and NVMe 8 mirrors NVMe 4.

Note: In actual operation, there are many running partitions in the system, so the mirror pairs selections depend on the drives that are available or allocated to the partition.

Table 3-18 shows the internal storage option that is installed in the Power E1050 server.

Table 3-18   Internal storage option in the Power E1050 server

| Feature Code                                   |   Description | Maximum   |

- a. All drives are driven directly through Gen4 connectors from the system board (there is no PCIe card and no cable). Future Gen5 NVMe drives can be installed, but run with Gen4 speed.

Note: Power E1050 runs only in single-port NVMe mode. Dual-port NVMe mode is not supported.

Table 3-19 lists the available NVMe drive Feature Codes for the Power E1050 server.

Attention: A minimum quantity of one SSD NVMe drive must be ordered with an AIX or Linux OS if SAN Boot (#0837) or Remote Load Source (#EHR2) is not ordered:

-  If SAN Boot (#0837) is ordered, then an adapter (FC or FCoE) that supports FC protocols to attach the system to a SAN must be ordered or present on the system instead.
-  If Remote Load Source (#EHR2) is ordered, then at least one HDD or SSD drive must be present in the EXP24SX (#ESLS) drawer (or existing EXP12SX (#ESLL).

There is no SAS backplane that is supported on the Power E1050 server. SAS drives can be placed in the IBM EXP24SX SAS Storage Enclosure that is connected to the system only by using SAS adapters.

Important: Each NVMe slot has a 15-mm NVMe form factor. The carrier conversion KIT (#EC7X) feature can be used for converting 7-mm NVMe devices (this kit can be used with #EC5J, #EC5K, #EC5L, #EC5X, or #EC7Q drives) into 15-mm devices. This feature can be ordered with no NVMe drives in the carrier.

The default priority of slots should be 15-mm NVMe drives options as a higher priority than #EC7X.

If #EC7X is ordered without drives, customers must self-install their existing 7-mm NVMe devices into the conversion kit.

## 3.9 External IO subsystems

If more PCIe slots beyond the system node slots are required, the Power E1050 server supports adding I/O expansion drawers:

-  PCIe Gen4 I/O expansion drawer
-  PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer

If you need more disks than are available with the internal disk bays, you can attach external disk subsystems that can be attached to the Power E1050 server, such as:

-  EXP24SX SAS Storage Enclosure
-  IBM System Storage

Note: The existing EXP12SX SAS Storage Enclosure (#ESLL) is still supported. Earlier storage enclosures like the EXP12S SAS Drawer (#5886) and EXP24 SCSI Disk Drawer (#5786) are not supported on the Power E1050.

## 3.9.1 PCIe Gen4 I/O expansion drawer

The PCIe Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawer is a replacement for the PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer. There is no upgrade path from PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer (#EMX0) to PCIe Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawer (#ENZ0), but you may intermix the two different drawers on a system. The PCIe Gen3 Expansion Drawer was withdrawn from marketing. The same connection card (#EJ2A) is supported for both drawers.

This 19 inch 4U (4 EIA) enclosure provides PCIe Gen4 slots outside of the system unit. It has two module bays. One 6-slot Fanout Module (#ENZF) can be placed in each module bay. Two 6-slot modules provide a total of 12 PCIe Gen4 slots. Each fanout module is connected to a PCIe4 Optical Cable adapter that is installed in the system unit over an active optical CXP cable (AOC) pair or CXP copper cable pair.

The PCIe Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawer has two redundant, hot-plug power supplies. Each power supply has its own separately ordered power cord. The two power cords plug into a power supply conduit that connects to the power supply. The single-phase AC power supply is rated at 1025 W and can use 100 - 127 V or 200 - 240 V. It is a best practice that the power supply connects to a power distribution unit (PDU) in the rack. IBM Power PDUs are designed for a 200 - 240 V electrical source.

A BSC is used to house the full-height adapters that are installed in these slots. The BSC is the same BSC that is used with previous generation PCIe Gen 3 12X attached I/O drawers (#5802, #5803, #5877, #5873, and #EMX0). The drawer includes a full set of BSCs, even if the BSCs are empty.

Concurrent repair, and adding or removing PCIe adapters, is done by HMC-guided menus or by OS support utilities.

IBM PCIe Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawer BSCs are mechanically the same as the previous PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawers, but the color is different for the touch points. Instead of terracotta color, the BSCs in the Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawer are blue. For that reason, cassettes from Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawers should Not Be Moved To The Gen4 I/O Expansion Drawer. Figure 3-3 Shows A Pcie4 Expansion drawer from the front.

Figure 3-3 Front view of PCIe Gen4 expansion drawer

- a. All 6 slots, including the x8 slots, use x16 connectors.
-  All slots are PCIe4 slots.
-  All slots support full-length, full-height adapters or short form-factor with a full-height tail stock in single-wide, Generation 3, BSCs.
-  Slots C0 - C3 in each PCIe4 6-slot Fanout Module are PCIe4 x16 buses and slots C4 and C5 are PCIe4 x8 buses.
-  All slots support enhanced error handling (EEH).
-  All PCIe slots can be serviced with the power on.

-  All six slots in a PCIe4 6-slot Fanout Module support Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) shared mode.
-  Only four Feature Code EC2S, Feature Code EC2U, or Feature Code EC72 adapters can be in SR-IOV mode simultaneously per 6-slot fanout module.

## Fanout modules that are supported by system

The number of fanout modules that are supported in a system differs by the system type and the number of fanout modules determine the number of I/O expansion drawer that are supported.

Table 3-21 lists the maximum number of fanout modules that are supported and the total number of cables per system for the Power E1050.

Table 3-21 Number of supported fanout modules per system

| System name            |   Maximum fanout  modules |   Maximum  number of G4  copper cables |   Maximum  number of G4  AOC cables |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| IBM Power System E1050 |                         8 |                                      8 |                                   8 |

## Supported PCIe4 cable adapters

The supported cable adapters for Power10 systems are listed in Table 3-22.

## 3.9.2  PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer

This 19 inch, 4U (4 EIA) enclosure provides PCIe Gen3 slots outside of the system unit. It has two module bays. One 6-slot fanout module (#EMXH) can be placed in each module bay. Two 6-slot modules provide a total of 12 PCIe Gen3 slots. Each fanout module is connected to a PCIe3 Optical Cable adapter that is in the system unit over an Active Optical Cable (AOC) pair or a CXP copper cable pair.

The PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer 1 has two redundant, hot-plug power supplies. Each power supply has its own separately ordered power cord. The two power cords plug in to a power supply conduit that connects to the power supply. The single-phase AC power supply is rated at 1030 W and can use 100 - 120 V or 200 - 240 V. If you use 100 - 120 V, then the maximum is 950 W. It is a best practice that the power supply connects to a power distribution unit (PDU) in the rack. Power Systems PDUs are designed for a 200 - 240 V electrical source.

The drawer has fixed rails that can accommodate racks with depths 27.5" (69.9 cm) - 30.5" (77.5 cm).

Attention: #EMX0 has a cable management bracket at the rear of the drawer that swings up to provide service access to the PCIe adapters. 2U (2 EIA) of space is required to swing up the bracket. Thus, the drawer cannot be placed at the top 2U of a rack. There is a power cord access consideration with vertically mounted PDUs on the right side of the rack when viewed from the rear of the rack. The #EMX0 cable management bracket makes accessing some of the PDU outlets at the same rack height as the #EMX0 drawer more challenging. Using a horizontally mounted PDU or placing the PDU or #EMX0 at a different vertical location is a best practice.

A BSC is used to house the full-height adapters that go into these slots. The BSC is the same BSC that is used with the previous generation server's 12X attached I/O drawers (#5802, #5803, #5877, and #5873). The drawer includes a full set of BSCs, even if the BSCs are empty.

Concurrent repair, and adding or removing PCIe adapters is done by HMC-guided menus or by OS support utilities.

## PCIe x16 to CXP Converter Adapter (Gen4)

The PCIe x16 to CXP Converter Adapter provides two ports for the attachment of two expansion drawer cables. One adapter supports the attachment of one PCIe3 6-slot fanout module in an EMX0 PCIe Gen3 I/O expansion drawer by using a CXP 16X AOC Pair.

The cable adapter can be placed in any slot in the system node. However, if an I/O expansion drawer is present, the PCIe x16 to CXP Converter Adapter must be given the highest priority. The maximum number of adapters that is supported is eight per system.

## PCIe Gen3 I/O expansion drawer optical cabling

I/O drawers are connected to the adapters in the system node through data transfer cables:

-  3 M Active Optical Cable Pair for PCIe3 Expansion Drawer (#ECCX)
-  10 M Active Optical Cable Pair for PCIe3 Expansion Drawer (#ECCY)
-  3 M Copper CXP Cable Pair for PCIe3 Expansion Drawer (#ECCS)

Note: The 3.0-meter copper cable pair connects a PCIe3 fanout module (#EMXH) in the PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer to a PCIe Optical Converter Adapter (#EJ2A) in the system unit. There are two identical copper cables in the cable pair, each with two CXP connectors.

The output of the adapter is a CXP interface that can also be used for this copper cable pair.

Although these cables are not redundant, the loss of one cable reduces the I/O bandwidth (that is, the number of lanes that are available to the I/O module) by 50%.

Cable lengths: Use the 3.0-m cables for intra-rack installations. Use the 10.0-m cables for inter-rack installations.

Limitation: You cannot mix copper and optical cables on the same PCIe Gen3 I/O drawer. Both fanout modules either both use copper cables or both use optical cables.

A minimum of one PCIe x16 to CXP Converter adapter for PCIe3 Expansion Drawer is required to connect to the PCIe3 6-slot fanout module in the I/O expansion drawer. The fanout module has two CXP ports. The top CXP port of the fanout module is cabled to the top CXP port of the PCIe x16 to CXP Converter adapter. The bottom CXP port of the fanout module is cabled to the bottom CXP port of the same PCIe x16 to CXP Converter adapter.

To set up the cabling correctly, complete the following steps:

- 1. Connect an optical cable or copper CXP cable to connector T1 on the PCIe x16 to CXP Converter adapter in your server.
- 2. Connect the other end of the optical cable or copper CXP cable to connector T1 on one of the PCIe3 6-slot fanout modules in your expansion drawer.
- 3. Connect another cable to connector T2 on the PCIe x16 to CXP Converter adapter in your server.
- 4. Connect the other end of the cable to connector T2 on the PCIe3 6-slot fanout module in your expansion drawer.
- 5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for the other PCIe3 6-slot fanout module in the expansion drawer, if required.

Drawer connections: Each fanout module in a PCIe3 Expansion Drawer can be connected only to a single PCIe x16 to CXP Converter adapter for PCIe3 Expansion Drawer.

## PCIe Gen3 I/O expansion drawer system power control network cabling

There is no system power control network (SPCN) that is used to control and monitor the status of power and cooling within the I/O drawer. SPCN capabilities are integrated into the optical cables.

Note: Feature conversions are available for earlier versions of the optical cables (#ECC7 #ECCX, and #ECC8 - #ECCY) and fan-out modules (#EMXG - #EMXH).

Table 3-27 provides an overview of all the PCIe adapters for the I/O expansion drawer that are connected to the Power E1050 server. Available means that the adapter is available and is orderable. Supported means that the adapter is supported on the Power E1050 server during a model conversion, that is, the adapter works, but more adapters cannot be ordered on the new system.

## 3.9.3  NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer

The NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer (#ESR0) is a storage expansion enclosure with 24 U.2 NVMe bays.

Each of the 24 NVMe bays in the NED24 drawer is separately addressable, and each can be assigned to a specific LPAR or VIOS to provide native boot support for up to 24 partitions. At the time of writing, each drawer can support up to 153 TB.

Figure 3-11 is a view of the front of the NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer.

Figure 3-11   NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer front view

<!-- image -->

Up to 24 U.2 NVMe devices can be installed in the NED24 drawer by using 15 mm Gen3 carriers. The 15 mm carriers can accommodate either 7 mm or 15 mm NVMe devices. The devices that are shown in Table 3-28 are supported in the NED24 drawer at the time of writing.

Table 3-28   Devices that are supported in the NED24 Expansion Drawer

| Feature   | Description                                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ES3H      | Enterprise 800 GB SSD PCIe4 NVMe U.2 module for AIX/Linux |
| ES3B      | Enterprise 1.6 TB SSD PCIe4 NVMe U.2 module for AIX/Linux |
| ES3D      | Enterprise 3.2 TB SSD PCIe4 NVMe U.2 module for AIX/Linux |
| ES3F      | Enterprise 6.4 TB SSD PCIe4 NVMe U.2 module for AIX/Linux |

Each NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer contains two redundant AC power supplies. The AC power supplies are part of the enclosure base.

## Prerequisites and support

This section provides more information about the OS and firmware requirements for the NED24 drawer.

## Power10 servers

The NED24 drawer is supported in the Power E1050 by using the same interconnect card that is used for the PCIe Gen 4 and PCIe Gen 3 Expansion Drawers. A maximum of three NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawers is supported per system in the Power E1050. When mixing the different expansion drawers, the maximum number of drawers that is supported is based on the number of EJ24 fanout cards that are supported.

Two PCIe4 cable adapters are required to connect each NED24 drive enclosure. This adapter is available as Feature Code EJ2A. This adapter is the same one that is used to connect the PCIe Gen3 I/O Expansion Drawer.

## Installation considerations

This section describes installation considerations for installing and connecting the NED24 drawer to your Power10 scale-out server.

## Connecting the NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer

The NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer is connected to an IBM Power server through dual CXP Converter adapters (#EJ24 or #EJ2A). The adapters are connected to the Expansion Service Manager (ESM) modules in the NED24 drawer by using either copper cables (up to 3 m) or optical cables (up to 20 m). The back of the NED24 drawer is shown in Figure 3-12, where you can see the locations to plug in the cables.

Figure 3-12   Back view of NED24 drawer

<!-- image -->

Both CXP Converter adapters require one of the following cable features:

-  #ECLR - 2.0 M Active Optical Cable x16 Pair for PCIe4 Expansion Drawer
-  #ECLS - 3.0 M CXP x16 Copper Cable Pair for PCIe4 Expansion Drawer
-  #ECLX - 3.0 M Active Optical Cable x16 Pair for PCIe4 Expansion Drawer
-  #ECLY - 10 M Active Optical Cable x16 Pair for PCIe4 Expansion Drawer
-  #ECLZ - 20 M Active Optical Cable x16 Pair for PCIe4 Expansion Drawer

Note: Each Feature Code provides two cables that connect from the server adapter to one of the ESMs. The same Feature Code should be used to connect the second server adapter to the other ESM. Each drawer requires two identical cable Feature Codes to connect.

## Operating system support

The NED24 drawer is supported by the OSs that are shown in Table 3-29 at the time of release.

Table 3-29   Operating system support for the NED24 drawer

| Operating system   | Levels supported                                                                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AIX                | 7.2 and 7.3                                                                            |
| Linux              | SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 and SUSE Linux Enterprise  Server 16 RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 |
| VIOS               | 3.1.4.21                                                                               |

## Firmware requirements

The minimum system firmware level that is required to support the NED24 drawer is FW1040, which requires HMC 10.2.1040 or later. When running with FW1040 or FW1050, the NED24 drawer runs in single-path mode. In single-path mode, each drive has a single connection to one of the ESMs and the use of OS mirroring is a best practice to provide high availability. Multipath connectivity is available starting with FW1060. For more information, see 'Multipath support' on page 114.

Important: The NED24 requires FW1040 or later to be installed on the connected system. If it is running FW 1040, then the following adapters are not supported by FW1040 and not concurrently installable with the NED24 drawer with FW 1040:

-  PCIe3 12 Gb x8 SAS Tape HBA adapter (#EJ2B/#EJ2C)
-  PCIe4 32 Gb 4-port optical FC adapter (#EN2L/#EN2M)
-  PCIe4 64 Gb 2-port optical FC adapter (#EN2N/#EN2P)
-  Mixed DDIMM support for the Power E1050 server (#EMCM)
-  100 V power supplies support for the Power S1022s server (#EB3R)

This restriction is removed with FM 1050 or later.

## Multipath support

From initial availability with firmware levels FW 1040 and FW 1050, only mode 1 (single connect) is supported for the NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer. In mode 1, only one of the ports on the dual-port NVMe drives is enabled and connected to one of the ESMs. As a best practice, use OS mirroring for critical devices because there is a single point of failure. The switch in each of the ESMs is configured to logically drive only 12 of the 24 NVMe drives. No device failover capability is available.

Starting with FW 1060, the NED24 NVMe drawer supports multipath. The multipath function supports two connections for each drive because each of the ports on the multiport drives is connected through both ESMs. This configuration provides more RAS and better performance.

Multipath is automatically enabled with the installation of FW 1060 and when the appropriate OS level is installed.

## Enabling multipath with AIX

The IBM AIX OS is enhanced to support multipath I/O capability with NVMe U.2 drives in a NED24 configuration in the following releases:

-  AIX 7.3 with the 7300-02 Technology Level and Service Pack 7300-02-02-2420 or later
-  AIX 7.2 with the 7200-05 Technology Level and Service Pack 7200-05-08-2420 or later
-  AIX 7.3 with the 7300-01 Technology Level and Service Pack 7300-01-04-2420 or later

When using system Firmware level FW1060.10 or later, each NVMe U.2 drive in the NED24 NVMe Expansion Drawer has a '-R1' or '-R2' suffix that is added to the end of its physical location code. Both drive paths must be assigned to a single logical partition (LPAR) by using the HMC LPAR Physical I/O Adapters page or through the partition's profile. The Partner Location Code column can be used to identify the other path to the NVMe U.2 drive in a multipath configuration, as shown in Figure 3-14.

Figure 3-14   HMC display of a multipath NVMe drive in NED24

<!-- image -->

Each of these device paths is seen by AIX as a separate device, for example, nvme0 and nvme1, as shown in Figure 3-15.

Figure 3-15   NED24 device listing with multipath

<!-- image -->

For the data on the NVMe drive to be seen through both paths, the NVMe namespace that you are using must be defined as shared. For load balancing of I/O operations between the two drive paths, the namespaces should be created as shared and attached from both drive paths.

In NVMe technology, a namespace (NS) is a logical grouping of data blocks that is accessible to host software. NVMe supports two namespace types:

-  Private namespaces are exclusive to the controller where they are created and cannot be accessed by other controllers within a multi-controller SSD.
-  Shared namespaces can be accessed from multiple controllers (I/O paths) within an NVMe subsystem, which provide increased flexibility and redundancy.

Figure 3-16 illustrates a shared namespace (B) that is accessible from both controllers.

Figure 3-16   Shared and private namespaces

<!-- image -->

Namespace management within AIX can be done through the SMIT interface.

For more information, see this Blog post.

## Drive installation order

Although there is no performance difference for drives in any of the NED24 slots, there is a best practice order for installation of drives within the enclosure. This order is especially important if you are not running in an environment that supports multipath and plan on using OS-level mirroring. The best practice provides good separation and good support for the mirroring between drives, and also provides optimal cooling and airflow within the enclosure.

Figure 3-17 shows the best practice placement for the first four drives.

## 3.9.4  EXP24SX SAS storage enclosure

The EXP24SX SAS storage enclosure (#ESLS) 2 is the only DASD drawer that is available for the Power E1050 that provides extra disk drives.

The EXP24SX drawer is a storage expansion enclosure with twenty-four 2.5-inch SFF SAS bays. It supports up to 24 hot-plug HDDs or SSDs in only 2 EIA of space in a 19-inch rack. The EXP24SX SFF bays use SFF Gen2 (SFF-2) carriers or trays.

The EXP24SX drawers feature the following high-reliability design points:

-  SAS bays that support hot-swap.
-  Redundant and hot-plug power and fan assemblies.
-  Dual power cords.
-  Redundant and hot-plug Enclosure Services Managers (ESMs).

-  Redundant data paths to all drives.
-  LED indicators on drives, bays, ESMs, and power supplies that support problem identification.
-  Through the SAS adapters and controllers, drives that can be protected with RAID and mirroring and hot-spare capability.

The enclosure has adjustable depth rails and can accommodate rack depths from 59.5 - 75 cm (23.4 - 29.5 inches). Slot filler panels are provided for empty bays when initially shipped from IBM.

With AIX, Linux, or VIOS, the EXP24SX can be ordered with four sets of six bays (mode 4), two sets of 12 bays (mode 2), or one set of 24 bays (mode 1). It is possible to change the mode setting in the field by using software commands along with a documented procedure.

Table 3-33 provides an overview of all the disks for the EXP24SX that are connected to the Power E1050. Available means that the device is available and is orderable.

Note: For the EXP24SX drawer, a maximum of twenty-four 2.5-inch SSDs or 2.5-inch HDDs are supported in the #ESLS 24 SAS bays. HDDs and SSDs cannot be mixed in the same mode-1 drawer. HDDs and SSDs can be mixed in a mode-2 or mode-4 drawer, but they cannot be mixed within a logical split of the drawer. For example, in a mode-2 drawer with two sets of 12 bays, one set can hold SSDs and one set can hold HDDs, but you cannot mix SSDs and HDDs in the same set of 12 bays.

Important: When changing modes, a skilled, technically qualified person must follow the specially documented procedures. Improperly changing modes can destroy RAID sets, which prevent access to data, or allow other partitions to access another partition's data.

The front view of the ESLS storage enclosure with mode group and drive locations is shown in Figure 3-18.

Four mini-SAS HD ports on the EXP24SX are attached to PCIe Gen3 SAS adapters. The following PCIe3 SAS adapters support the EXP24SX:

-  PCIe3 RAID SAS Adapter Quad-port 6 Gb x8 (#EJ0J)
-  PCIe3 12 GB Cache RAID SAS Adapter Quad-port 6 Gb x8 (#EJ0L)
-  PCIe3 LP RAID SAS Adapter Quad-port 6 Gb x8 (#EJ0M)
-  PCIe3 12 GB Cache RAID Plus SAS Adapter Quad-port 6 Gb x8 (#EJ14)

The attachment between the EXP24SX drawer and the PCIe Gen 3 SAS adapter is through SAS YO12 or X12 cables. The PCIe Gen 3 SAS adapters support 6 Gb throughput. The EXP24SX drawer can support up to 12 Gb throughput if future SAS adapters support that capability. Thee Cable options are:

-  3.0 M SAS X12 Cable (Two Adapters to Enclosure) (#ECDJ)
-  4.5 M SAS X12 Active Optical Cable (Two Adapters to Enclosure) (#ECDK)
-  10 M SAS X12 Active Optical Cable (Two Adapters to Enclosure) (#ECDL)
-  1.5 M SAS YO12 Cable (Adapter to Enclosure) (#ECDT)
-  3.0 M SAS YO12 Cable (Adapter to Enclosure) (#ECDU)
-  4.5 M SAS YO12 Active Optical Cable (Adapter to Enclosure) (#ECDV)
-  10 M SAS YO12 Active Optical Cable (Adapter to Enclosure) (#ECDW)

Six SAS connectors are at the rear of the EXP24SX drawers to which SAS adapters or controllers are attached. They are labeled T1, T2, and T3: two T1s, two T2s, and two T3s connectors. Consider the following points:

-  In mode 1, two or four of the six ports are used. Two T2 ports are used for a single SAS adapter, and two T2 and two T3 ports are used with a paired set of two adapters or a dual adapters configuration.
-  In mode 2 or mode 4, four ports are used (two T2s and two T3 connectors) to access all the SAS bays.
-  The T1 connectors are not used.

Figure 3-19 shows the connector locations for the EXP24SX storage enclosure.

The Power E1050 server fits a standard 19-inch rack. The server is certified and tested in the IBM Enterprise racks (7965-S42 and 7014-T42). Customers can choose to place the server in other racks if they are confident that those racks have the strength, rigidity, depth, and hole pattern characteristics that are needed. Contact IBM Support to determine whether other racks are suitable.

Order information: It is a best practice that the Power E1050 server be ordered with an IBM 42U enterprise rack #ECR0 (7965-S42). This rack provides a complete and higher-quality environment for IBM Manufacturing system assembly and testing, and provides a complete package.

If a system is installed in a rack or cabinet that is not from IBM, help ensure that the rack meets the requirements that are described in 3.10.6, 'Original equipment manufacturer racks' on page 131.

Responsibility: The customer is responsible for helping ensure the installation of the drawer in the preferred rack or cabinet results in a configuration that is stable, serviceable, safe, and compatible with the drawer requirements for power, cooling, cable management, weight, and rail security.

## 3.10.1  New rack considerations

Consider the following points when racks are ordered:

-  The new IBM Enterprise 42U Slim Rack 7965-S42 offers 42 EIA units (U) of space in a slim footprint.
-  The 7014-T42 rack is no longer available to purchase with a Power E1050 server. Installing a Power E1050 server in this rack is still supported.

Vertical PDUs: All PDUs that are installed in a rack that contains a Power E1050 server must be installed horizontally to allow for cable routing in the sides of the rack.

## 3.10.2 IBM Enterprise 42U Slim Rack 7965-S42

The 2.0-meter (79-inch) Model 7965-S42 is compatible with past and present IBM Power servers and provides an excellent 19-inch rack enclosure for your data center. Its 600 mm (23.6 in.) width combined with its 1100 mm (43.3 in.) depth plus its 42 EIA enclosure capacity provides great footprint efficiency for your systems. It can be placed easily on standard 24-inch floor tiles.

Compared to the 7965-94Y Slim Rack, the Enterprise Slim Rack provides extra strength and shipping and installation flexibility.

The 7965-S42 rack includes space for up to four PDUs in side pockets. Extra PDUs beyond four are mounted horizontally and each uses 1U of rack space.

The Enterprise Slim Rack comes with options for the installed front door:

-  Basic Black/Flat (#ECRM)
-  High-End appearance (#ECRF)
-  OEM Black (#ECRE)

All options include perforated steel, which provides ventilation, physical security, and visibility of indicator lights in the installed equipment within. All options come with a lock and mechanism included that is identical to the lock on the rear doors. Only one front door must be included for each rack ordered. The basic door (#ECRM) and OEM door (#ECRE) can be hinged on the left or right side.

Orientation: #ECRF must not be flipped because the IBM logo would be upside down.

At the rear of the rack, either a perforated steel rear door (#ECRG) or a Rear Door Heat Exchanger (RDHX) can be installed. The only supported RDHX is IBM Machine Type 1164-95X, which can remove up to 30,000 watts (102,000 BTU) of heat per hour by using chilled water. The no additional charge Feature Code #ECR2 is included with the Enterprise Slim Rack as an indicator when ordering the RDHX.

The basic door (#ECRG) can be hinged on the left or right side, and includes a lock and mechanism identical to the lock on the front door. Either the basic rear door (#ECRG) or the RDHX indicator (#ECR2) must be included with the order of a new Enterprise Slim Rack.

Due to the depth of the Power E1050 server model, the 5-inch rear rack extension (#ECRK) is required for the Enterprise Slim Rack to accommodate this system. This extension expands the space that is available for cable management and allows the rear door to close safely.

## Lifting considerations

Three to four service personnel are required to manually remove or insert a system unit into a rack because of its dimensions, weight, and content. To avoid the need for this many people to assemble at a client site for a service action, a lift tool can be useful. Similarly, if the client chose to install this customer setup (CSU) system, similar lifting considerations apply.

The Power E1050 server has a maximum weight of 70.3 kg (155 lb). However, by temporarily removing the power supplies, fans, and RAID assembly, the weight is easily reduced to a maximum of 55 kg (121 lb).

When lowering the Power E1050 server onto its rails in the rack, the server must be tilted on one end about 15 degrees so that the pins on the server enclosure fit onto the rails. This equates to lifting one end of the server 4 cm (1.6 in.). This task can be done by using a tip plate on a lift tool, manually adjusting the load on a lift tool, or tilting during the manual lift. Consider the optional feature #EB2Z lift tool.

## 3.10.3 AC power distribution unit and rack content

The IBM high-function PDUs provide more electrical power per PDU as earlier IBM PDUs, and they offer better PDU footprint efficiency. In addition, they are intelligent PDUs (iPDUs) that provide insight to actual power usage by receptacle and also provide remote power on/off capability for support by individual receptacle. The latest PDUs can be ordered as #ECJJ, #ECJL, #ECJN, and #ECJQ.

IBM Manufacturing integrates only the newer PDUs with the Power E1050 server. IBM Manufacturing does not support integrating earlier PDUs, such as #7188, #7109, or #7196. Clients can choose to use older IBM PDUs in their racks, but must install those earlier PDUs at their site.

Table 3-34 summarizes the high-function PDU Feature Codes for 7965-S42 followed by a descriptive list.

Table 3-34   High-function PDUs that are available with IBM Enterprise Slim Rack (7965-S42)

| PDUs                   | 1-phase or 3-phase  depending on country wiring standards   | 3-phase 208 V depending on  country wiring standards   |

| Twelve C13 receptacles | #ECJN                                                       | #ECJQ                                                  |

- a. The Power E1050 server has an AC power supply with a C19/C20 connector.

Power sockets: The Power E1050 server takes IEC 60320 C19/C20 mains power and not C13. Help ensure that the correct power cords and PDUs are ordered or available in the rack.

-  High Function 9xC19 PDU plus (#ECJJ)
- This intelligent, switched 200 - 240 V AC PDU includes nine C19 receptacles on the front of the PDU. The PDU is mounted on the rear of the rack, which makes the nine C19 receptacles easily accessible. For comparison, this PDU is most like the earlier generation #EPTJ PDU.
-  High Function 9xC19 PDU plus 3-Phase (#ECJL)
- This intelligent, switched 208 V 3-phase AC PDU includes nine C19 receptacles on the front of the PDU. The PDU is mounted on the rear of the rack, which makes the nine C19 receptacles easily accessible. For comparison, this PDU is most like the earlier generation #EPTL PDU.
-  High Function 12xC13 PDU plus (#ECJN)
- This intelligent, switched 200 - 240 V AC PDU includes 12 C13 receptacles on the front of the PDU. The PDU is mounted on the rear of the rack, which makes the 12 C13 receptacles easily accessible. For comparison, this PDU is most like the earlier generation #EPTN PDU.
-  High Function 12xC13 PDU plus 3-Phase (#ECJQ)
- This intelligent, switched 208 V 3-phase AC PDU includes 12 C13 receptacles on the front of the PDU. The PDU is mounted on the rear of the rack, which makes the 12 C13 receptacles easily accessible. For comparison, this PDU is most like the earlier generation #EPTQ PDU.

The PDU receives power through a UTG0247 power-line connector. Each PDU requires one PDU-to-wall power cord. Various power cord features are available for various countries and applications by varying the PDU-to-wall power cord, which must be ordered separately.

Each power cord provides the unique design characteristics for the specific power requirements. To match new power requirements and save previous investments, these power cords can be requested with an initial order of the rack or with a later upgrade of the rack features.

Table 3-35 shows the available wall power cord options for the PDU features, which must be ordered separately.

Notes: Help ensure that the suitable power cord feature is configured to support the power that is being supplied. Based on the power cord that is used, the PDU can supply 4.8 - 19.2 kVA. The power of all the drawers that are plugged into the PDU must not exceed the power cord limitation.

The Universal PDUs are compatible with previous models.

To better enable electrical redundancy, the Power E1050 server has four power supplies that must be connected to separate PDUs, which are not included in the base order. For maximum availability, a best practice is to connect power cords from the same system to two separate PDUs in the rack, and to connect each PDU to independent power sources.

For more information about the power requirements of and the power cord for the 7965-94Y rack, see IBM Documentation.

## 3.10.4  Rack-mounting rules

Consider the following primary rules when you mount the system into a rack:

-  The system can be placed at any location in the rack. For rack stability, start filling the rack from the bottom.
-  As as best practice, use an IBM approved lift tool for the installation of systems into any IBM or third-party rack.
-  IBM does not support the installation of server nodes higher than the 29U position.
-  Any remaining space in the rack can be used to install other systems or peripheral devices. Help ensure that the maximum permissible weight of the rack is not exceeded and the installation rules for these devices are followed.
-  Before placing the system into the service position, follow the rack manufacturer's safety instructions regarding rack stability.

Order information: The racking approach for the initial order must be 7965-S42 or #ECR0. If an extra rack is required for I/O expansion drawers, an MES to a system or an #0553 must be ordered.

## 3.10.6 Original equipment manufacturer racks

The system can be installed in a suitable OEM rack if that the rack conforms to the EIA-310-D standard for 19-inch racks. This standard is published by the Electrical Industries Alliance. For more information, see IBM Documentation.

IBM Documentation provides the general rack specifications, including the following information:

-  The rack or cabinet must meet the EIA Standard EIA-310-D for 19-inch racks, which was published August 24, 1992. The EIA-310-D standard specifies internal dimensions, for example, the width of the rack opening (width of the chassis), the width of the module mounting flanges, and the mounting hole spacing.
-  The front rack opening must be a minimum of 450 mm (17.72 in.) wide, and the rail-mounting holes must be 465 mm plus or minus 1.6 mm (18.3 in. plus or minus 0.06 in.) apart on center (horizontal width between vertical columns of holes on the two front-mounting flanges and on the two rear-mounting flanges).

Figure 3-21 is a top view showing the rack specification dimensions.

Figure 3-21   Rack specifications (top-down view)

<!-- image -->

-  The vertical distance between mounting holes must consist of sets of three holes that are spaced (from bottom to top) 15.9 mm (0.625 in.), 15.9 mm (0.625 in.), and 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) on center, which makes each three-hole set of vertical hole spacing 44.45 mm (1.75 in.) apart on center.

Figure 3-22 shows the vertical distances between the mounting holes.

## Reliability, availability, and serviceability

IBM Power servers offer exceptional agility, reliability, and sustainability, making them ideal for demanding workloads. Renowned for their scalability and performance, Power servers provide superior virtualization and management features for flexibility and enhanced security.

With a record of reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS), Power servers have consistently achieved superior availability ratings for over a decade. This chapter explores the components and features that contribute to their exceptional availability.

The following topics are covered in this chapter:

-  4.1, 'Designing for reliability' on page 134
-  4.2, 'Service processor' on page 136
-  4.3, 'Memory subsystem RAS' on page 137
-  4.4, 'Power10 processor RAS' on page 139
-  4.5, 'I/O subsystem RAS' on page 141
-  4.6, 'Serviceability' on page 141
-  4.7, 'Reliability and availability' on page 146

## 4.1  Designing for reliability

The reliability of the IBM Power E1050 is rooted in its highly reliable components, devices, and subsystems. Rigorous verification and integration testing are conducted during design and development, and extensive testing helps ensure the highest product quality during manufacturing.

Reliability measures the frequency of failures. Availability focuses on the impact of failures on workload interruptions. A system with longer intervals between interruptions is considered more available. Serviceability measures the efficiency of identifying and resolving failures to minimize application outages during repairs.

The Power E1050 offers the following RAS characteristics:

-  Enterprise Baseboard Management Controller (BMC): A service processor for system management and service.
-  Open Memory Interface (OMI) and DDIMMs: Advanced RAS features for memory subsystems.
-  Power10 Processor RAS: Robust reliability features in the Power10 processor.
-  I/O Subsystem RAS: Reliable I/O subsystem design.
-  Serviceability: Efficient failure identification and resolution.

Here are some additional RAS features:

-  Redundant and hot-plug cooling: Helps ensure continuous operation even with component failures.
-  Redundant and hot-plug power: Provides backup power supplies for uninterrupted operation.
-  Redundant voltage regulators: Protects against power supply failures.
-  Time of day battery concurrent maintenance: Allows battery replacement without system downtime.




## 4.2  Service processor

The Power10 E1050 comes with a redesigned service processor that is based on a BMC design with firmware that is accessible through open-source industry-standard application programming interfaces (APIs), such as Redfish. An upgraded Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) web browser user interface preserves the required RAS functions while allowing the user to perform tasks in a more intuitive way.

Diagnostic monitoring of recoverable errors from the processor chipset is performed on the system processor itself, and the unrecoverable diagnostic monitoring of the processor chipset is performed by the service processor. The service processor runs on its own power boundary and does not require resources from a system processor to be operational to perform its tasks.

The service processor supports surveillance of the connection to the Hardware Management Console (HMC) and to the system firmware (hypervisor). It also provides several remote power control options, environmental monitoring, reset, restart, remote maintenance, and diagnostic functions, including console mirroring. The BMC service processors menus (ASMI) can be accessed concurrently during system operation, allowing nondisruptive abilities to change system default parameters, view and download error logs, and check system health.

Redfish, an industry-standard API for server management, enables IBM Power servers to be managed individually or in a large data center. Standard functions such as inventory, event logs, sensors, dumps, and certificate management are all supported by Redfish. In addition, new user management features support multiple users and privileges on the BMC through Redfish or ASMI. User management through lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is also supported. The Redfish events service provides a means for notification of specific critical events such that actions can be taken to correct issues. The Redfish telemetry service provides access to a wide variety of data (such as power consumption, and ambient, core, DIMMs, and I/O temperatures) that can be streamed at periodic intervals.

The service processor monitors the operation of the firmware during the boot process and also monitors the hypervisor for termination. The hypervisor monitors the service processor and reports a service reference code when it detects a surveillance loss. In the PowerVM environment, it performs a reset/reload if it detects the loss of the service processor.

## 4.3.1 Memory buffer

The DDIMM contains a memory buffer with key RAS features, including protection of critical data/address flows by using CRC, ECC, and parity; a maintenance engine for background memory scrubbing and memory diagnostics; and a Fault Isolation Register (FIR) structure, which enables firmware attention-based fault isolation and diagnostics.

## 4.3.2  Open Memory Interface

The OMI interface between the memory buffer and processor memory controller is protected by dynamic lane calibration, and a CRC retry/recovery facility to retransmit lost frames to survive intermittent bit flips. A lane fail can also be survived by triggering a dynamic lane reduction from 8 to 4, independently for both up and downstream directions. A key advantage of the OMI interface is that it simplifies the number of critical signals that must cross connectors from processor to memory compared to a typical industry-standard DIMM design.

## 4.3.3  Memory ECC

The DDIMM includes a robust 64-byte Memory ECC with 8-bit symbols, which can correct up to five symbol errors (one x4 chip and one additional symbol), and retry for data and address uncorrectable errors.

## 4.3.4 Dynamic row repair

To further extend the life of the DDIMM, the dynamic row repair feature can restore full use of a DRAM for a fault that is contained to a DRAM row while the system continues to operate.

## 4.3.5  Spare temperature sensors

Each DDIMM has spare temperature sensors so that the failure of one does not require a DDIMM replacement.

## 4.3.6  Spare DRAMs

4U DDIMMs include two spare x4 memory modules (DRAMs) per rank, which can be substituted for failed DRAMs during a runtime operation. Combined with ECC correction, the two spares allow a 4U DDIMM to continue to function with three bad DRAMs per rank, compared to 1 (single device data correct) or 2 (double device data correct) bad DRAMs in a typical industry-standard DIMM design. This setup extends self-healing capabilities beyond what is provided with the dynamic row repair capability.

## 4.3.7 Spare Power Management Integrated Circuits

4U DDIMMs include spare PMICs so that the failure of one PMIC does not require a DDIMM replacement.

## 4.4  Power10 processor RAS

Although there are many differences internally in the Power10 processor compared to the Power9 processor that relate to performance, number of cores, and other features, the general RAS philosophy for how errors are handled has remains the same. Therefore, information about Power9 processor-based subsystem RAS can still be referenced to understand the design. For more information, see Introduction to IBM Power Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability for Power9 processor-based systems using IBM PowerVM .

The Power E1050 processor module is a dual-chip module (DCM) that differs from the Power E950, which has a single-chip module (SCM). Each DCM has 30 processor cores, which is 120 cores for a 4-socket (4S) Power E1050. In comparison, a 4S Power E950 supports 48 cores. The internal processor buses are twice as fast with the Power E1050 running at 32 Gbps.

Despite the increased cores and the faster high-speed processor bus interfaces, the RAS capabilities are equivalent, with features like PIR, L2/L3 Cache ECC protection with cache line delete, and the CRC fabric bus retry that is a characteristic of Power9 and Power10 processors. As with the Power E950, when an internal fabric bus lane encounters a hard failure in a Power E1050, the lane can be dynamically spared out.

## 4.4.1  Cache availability

The L2/L3 caches in the Power10 processor in the memory buffer chip are protected with double-bit detect, single-bit correct ECC. In addition, a threshold of correctable errors that are detected on cache lines can result in the data in the cache lines being purged and the cache lines removed from further operation without requiring a restart in the PowerVM environment. Modified data is handled through Special Uncorrectable Error (SUE) handling. L1 data and instruction caches also have a retry capability for intermittent errors and a cache set delete mechanism for handling solid failures.

## 4.4.2 Special Uncorrectable Error handling

SUE handling prevents an uncorrectable error in memory or cache from immediately causing the system to end. Rather, the system tags the data and determines whether it will ever be used again. If the error is irrelevant, it will not force a checkstop. When and if data is used, I/O adapters that are controlled by an I/O hub controller freeze if the data were transferred to an I/O device; otherwise, termination can be limited to the program/kernel, or if the data is not owned by the hypervisor.

## 4.4.3  Uncorrectable error recovery

When the auto-restart option is enabled, the system can automatically restart following an unrecoverable software error, hardware failure, or environmentally induced (AC power) failure.

## 4.5  I/O subsystem RAS

The Power E1050 provides 11 general-purpose Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) slots that allow for hot-plugging of I/O adapters, which makes the adapters concurrently maintainable. These PCIe slots operate at Gen4 and Gen5 speeds. Some of the PCIe slots support OpenCAPI and I/O expansion drawer cable cards.

Unlike the Power E950, the Power E1050 location codes start from index 0, as with all Power10 servers. However, slot c0 is not a general-purpose PCIe slot because it is reserved for the eBMC Service Processor card.

Another difference between the Power E950 and the Power E1050 is that all the Power E1050 slots are directly connected to a Power10 processor. In the Power E950, some slots are connected to the Power9 processor through I/O switches.

All 11 PCIe slots are available if 3-socket or 4-socket DCMs are populated. In the 2-socket DCM configuration, only seven PCIe slots are functional.

## DASD options

The Power E1050 provides 10 internal Non-volatile Memory Express (NVMe) drives at Gen4 speeds, which means that they are concurrently maintainable. The NVMe drives are connected to DCM0 and DCM3. In a 2-socket DCM configuration, only six of the drives are available. To access to all 10 internal NVMe drives, you must have a 4S DCM configuration. Unlike the Power E950, the Power E1050 has no internal serial-attached SCSI (SAS) drives You can use an external drawer to provide SAS drives.

The internal NVMe drives support OS-controlled RAID 0 and RAID 1 array, but no hardware RAID. For best redundancy, use an OS mirror and dual Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) mirror. To help ensure as much separation as possible in the hardware path between mirror pairs, the following NVMe configuration is a best practice:

-  Mirrored OS: NVMe3 and NVMe4 pairs, or NVMe8 and NVMe9 pairs
-  Mirrored dual VIOS:
- - Dual VIOS: NVMe3 for VIOS1, NVMe4 for VIOS2.
- - Mirrored dual VIOS: NVMe9 mirrors NVMe3, and NVMe8 mirrors NVMe4.

## 4.6  Serviceability

The purpose of serviceability is to efficiently repair the system while attempting to minimize or eliminate any impact to system operation. Serviceability includes system installation, Miscellaneous Equipment Specification (MES) (system upgrades/fallbacks), and system maintenance or repair. Depending on the system and warranty contract, the service may be performed by the client, an IBM representative, or an authorized warranty service provider. The serviceability features that are delivered in this system help provide a highly efficient service environment by incorporating the following attributes:

-  Designed for IBM System Services Representative (IBM SSR) setup, install, and service.
-  Error Detection and Fault Isolation (ED/FI).
-  FFDC.
-  Light path service indicators.
-  Service and FRU labels that are available on the system.
-  Service procedures are documented in IBM Documentation or available through the HMC.
-  Automatic reporting of serviceable events to IBM through the Electronic Service Agent (ESA) Call Home application.

## 4.6.1 Service environment

In the PowerVM environment, the HMC is a dedicated server that provides functions for configuring and managing servers for either partitioned or full-system partition by using a GUI, command-line interface (CLI), or Representational State Transfer (REST) API. An HMC that is attached to the system enables support personnel (with client authorization) to remotely or locally (by using the physical HMC that is in proximity of the server being serviced) log in to review error logs and perform remote maintenance if required.

The Power10 processor-based servers support several service environments:

-  Attachment to one or more HMCs or virtual HMCS (vHMCs) is a supported option by the system with PowerVM. This configuration is the default one for servers supporting logical partitions (LPARs) with dedicated or virtual I/O. In this case, all servers have at least one LPAR.
-  No HMC. There are two service strategies for non-HMC systems:
- - Full-system partition with PowerVM: A single partition owns all the server resources and only one operating system (OS) may be installed. The primary service interface is through the OS and the service processor.
- - Partitioned system with NovaLink: In this configuration, the system can have more than one partition and can be running more than one OS. The primary service interface is through the service processor.

## 4.6.2  Service interface

Support personnel can use the service interface to communicate with the service support applications in a server by using an operator console, a GUI on the management console or service processor, or an OS terminal. The service interface helps to deliver a clear, concise view of available service applications, helping the support team to manage system resources and service information in an efficient and effective way. Applications that are available through the service interface are carefully configured and placed to grant service providers access to important service functions. Different service interfaces are used, depending on the state of the system, hypervisor, and operating environment. The primary service interfaces are:

-  LEDs
-  Operator panel
-  BMC Service Processor menu
-  OS service menu
-  Service Focal Point (SFP) on the HMC or vHMC with PowerVM

In the light path LED implementation, the system can clearly identify components for replacement by using specific component-level LEDs and also can guide the servicer directly to the component by signaling (turning on solid) the enclosure fault LED and component FRU fault LED. The servicer can also use the identify function to flash the FRU-level LED. When this function is activated, a roll-up to the blue enclosure locate occurs. These enclosure LEDs turn on solid and can be used to follow the light path from the enclosure and down to the specific FRU in the PowerVM environment.

## 4.6.3 First Failure Data Capture and error data analysis

FFDC is a technique that helps ensure that when a fault is detected in a system, the root cause of the fault is captured without the need to re-create the problem or run any extending tracing or diagnostics program. For most faults, a good FFDC design means that the root cause can also be detected automatically without servicer intervention.

FFDC information, error data analysis, and fault isolation are necessary to implement the advanced serviceability techniques that enable efficient service of the systems and to help determine the failing items.

In the rare absence of FFDC and Error Data Analysis, diagnostics are required to re-create the failure and determine the failing items.

## 4.6.4  Diagnostics

The general diagnostic objectives are to detect and identify problems so that they can be resolved quickly. Elements of th IBM diagnostics strategy include:

-  Provides a common error code format equivalent to a system reference code with a PowerVM, system reference number, checkpoint, or firmware error code.
-  Provides fault detection and problem isolation procedures. Supports remote connection, which can be used by the IBM Remote Support Center or IBM Designated Service.
-  Provides interactive intelligence within the diagnostics with detailed online failure information while connected to the IBM back-end system.

## 4.6.5  Automatic diagnostics

The processor and memory FFDC technology is designed to perform without re-creating diagnostics or user intervention. Solid and intermittent errors are correctly detected and isolated at the time that the failure occurs. Runtime and boot-time diagnostics fall into this category.

## 4.6.6 Stand-alone diagnostics

As the name implies, stand-alone or user-initiated diagnostics requires user intervention. The user must perform manual steps, including:

-  Booting from the diagnostics CD, DVD, Universal Serial Bus (USB), or network
-  Interactively selecting steps from a list of choices

## 4.6.7  Concurrent maintenance

The determination of whether a firmware release can be updated concurrently is identified in the readme file that is released with the firmware. An HMC is required for a concurrent firmware update with PowerVM. In addition, concurrent maintenance of PCIe adapters and NVMe drives is supported by PowerVM. Power supplies, fans, and operating panel LCDs are hot-pluggable.

## 4.6.8 Service labels

Service providers use these labels to assist them in performing maintenance actions. Service label, which are found in various formats and positions, are intended to transmit readily available information to the servicer during the repair process. Here are some of these service labels and their purposes:

-  Location diagrams: Location diagrams are on the system hardware, relating information regarding the placement of hardware components. Location diagrams might include location codes, drawings of physical locations, concurrent maintenance status, or other data that is pertinent to a repair. Location diagrams are especially useful when multiple components such as DIMMs, processors, fans, adapters, and power supplies are installed.
-  Remove/replace procedures: Service labels that contain remove/replace procedures are often found on a cover of the system or in other spots accessible to the servicer. These labels provide systematic procedures, including diagrams detailing how to remove or replace certain serviceable hardware components.
-  Arrows: Numbered arrows are used to indicate the order of operation and the serviceability direction of components. Some serviceable parts such as latches, levers, and touch points must be pulled or pushed in a certain direction and in a certain order for the mechanical mechanisms to engage or disengage. Arrows generally improve the ease of serviceability.

## 4.6.9 QR labels

QR labels are placed on the system to provide access to key service functions through a mobile device. When the QR label is scanned, it goes to a landing page for Power10 processor-based systems, which contains each machine type and model (MTM) service functions of interest while physically at the server. These functions include things installation and repair instructions, reference code lookup, and other items.

## 4.6.10  Packaging for service

The following service features are included in the physical packaging of the systems to facilitate service:

-  Color coding (touch points): Blue-colored touch points delineate touch points on service components where the component can be safely handled for service actions, such as removal or installation.
-  Tool-less design: Selected IBM systems support tool-less or simple tool designs. These designs require no tools or simple tools such as flathead screw drivers to service the hardware components.
-  Positive retention: Positive retention mechanisms help to help ensure proper connections between hardware components, such as cables to connectors, and between two cards that attach to each other. Without positive retention, hardware components run the risk of becoming loose during shipping or installation, preventing a good electrical connection. Positive retention mechanisms like latches, levers, thumbscrews, pop nylatches (U-clips), and cables are included to help prevent loose connections and aid in installing (seating) parts correctly. These positive retention items do not require tools.

## 4.6.11 Error handling and reporting

In a system hardware or environmentally induced failure, the system runtime error capture capability systematically analyzes the hardware error signature to determine the cause of failure. The analysis result is stored in system NVRAM. When the system can be successfully restarted either manually or automatically, or if the system continues to operate, the error is reported to the OS. Hardware and software failures are recorded in the system log. When an HMC is attached in the PowerVM environment, an ELA routine analyzes the error, forwards the event to the SFP application running on the HMC, and notifies the system administrator that it has isolated a likely cause of the system problem. The service processor event log also records unrecoverable checkstop conditions, forwards them to the SFP application, and notifies the system administrator.

The system can call home through the OS to report platform-recoverable errors and errors that are associated with PCI adapters or devices.

In the HMC-managed environment, a Call Home service request is initiated from the HMC, and the pertinent failure data with service parts information and part locations is sent to an IBM service organization. Customer contact information and specific system-related data, such as the MTM and serial number, along with error log data that is related to the failure, are sent to IBM Service.

## 4.6.12  Live Partition Mobility

With PowerVM Live Partition Mobility (LPM), users can migrate an AIX, IBM i, or Linux VM partition running on one IBM Power partition server to another IBM Power server without disrupting services. The migration transfers the entire system environment, including processor state, memory, attached virtual devices, and connected users. It provides continuous OS and application availability during planned partition outages for repair of hardware and firmware faults. The Power10 servers that use Power10 processor-based technology support secure LPM, where the VM image is encrypted and compressed before transfer. Secure LPM uses on-chip encryption and compression capabilities of the Power10 processor for optimal performance.

## 4.6.13  Call Home

Call Home refers to an automatic or manual call from a client location to the IBM support structure with error log data, server status, or other service-related information. Call Home starts the service organization for the appropriate service action to begin. Call Home can be done through the ESA that is embedded in the HMC, or through a version of the ESA that is embedded in the OSs for non-HMC-managed or a version of ESA that runs as a stand-alone Call Home application. While configuring Call Home is optional, clients are encouraged to implement this feature to obtain service enhancements such as reduced problem determination and faster and potentially more accurate transmittal of error information. In general, using the Call Home feature can result in increased system availability.

## 4.6.14 IBM Electronic Services

ESA and Client Support Portal (CSP) comprise the IBM Electronic Services solution, which is dedicated to providing fast, exceptional support to IBM clients. ESA is a no-charge tool that proactively monitors and reports hardware events, such as system errors, and collects hardware and software inventory. ESA can help focus on the client's company business initiatives, save time, and spend less effort managing day-to-day IT maintenance issues. In addition, Call Home Cloud Connect Web and Mobile capability extends the common solution and offers IBM Systems related support information that is applicable to servers and storage.

For more information, see IBM Call Home Connect Cloud.

## 4.7  Reliability and availability

This section looks at the more general concept of RAS as it applies to any system in the data center.

The goal is to briefly define what RAS is and look at how reliability and availability are measured.

## 4.7.1  Reliability modeling

The prediction of system level reliability starts with establishing the failure rates of the individual components that make up the system. Then, by using the appropriate prediction models, the component-level failure rates are combined to provide a system-level reliability prediction in terms of a failure rate.

However, in documentation system-level reliability is often described in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF) for repairable systems rather than a failure rate, for example, 50 years MTBF.

A 50-year MTBF might suggest that a system runs 50 years between failures, but what it means is that among 50 identical systems, one per year fails on average over a large population of systems.

## 4.7.2  Different levels of reliability

When a component fails, the impact of that failure can vary depending on the component.

A power supply failing in a system with a redundant power supply must be replaced. However, by itself a failure of a single power supply should not cause a system outage, and it should be a concurrent repair with no downtime.

Other components in a system might fail and cause a system-wide outage where concurrent repair is not possible. Therefore, it is typical to talk about different MTBF numbers:

-  MTBF - Results in repair actions.
-  MTBF - Requires concurrent repair.
-  MTBF - Requires a non-concurrent repair.
-  MTBF - Results in an unplanned application outage.
-  MTBF - Results in an unplanned system outage.

## 4.7.3 Measuring availability

Mathematically speaking, availability is often expressed as a percentage of the time that something is available or in use over a period. An availability number for a system can be mathematically calculated from the expected reliability of the system if both the MTBF and the duration of each outage is known.

For example, consider a system that always runs exactly one week between failures and each time it fails it is down for 10 minutes. For 168 hours in a week, the system is down (10/60) hours. It is up 168 hrs - (10/60) hrs. As a percentage of the hours in the week, it can be said that the system is (168-(1/6))*100% = 99.9% available.

99.999% available means approximately 5.3 minutes of downtime in a year. On average, a system that failed once a year and was down for 5.3 minutes is 99.999% available. This concept is often called 'five 9s of availability'.

When talking about modern server hardware availability, short weekly failures like in the example is not the norm. Rather, the failure rates are lower, and the MTBF is often measured in terms of years.

Therefore, when an MTBF of 10 years, for example, is quoted, it is not expected that on average each system runs 10 years between failures. Rather, it is more reasonable to expect that on average in a year that 1 server out of 10 fails. If a population of 10 servers always had exactly one failure a year, a statement of 99.999% availability across that population of servers means that the one server that failed is down about 53 minutes when it failed.

In theory, five 9s of availability can be achieved by having a system design that fails frequently, multiple times a year, but whose failures are limited to small periods of time. Conversely, five 9 s of availability might mean a server design with a large MTBF, but where a server takes a fairly long time to recover from the rare outage.

Figure 4-3 shows that five 9s of availability can be achieved with systems that fail frequently for minuscule amounts of time, or infrequently with larger downtime per failure.

Figure 4-3   Five 9s of availability

<!-- image -->

Figure 4-3 on page 147 is misleading in the sense that servers with low reliability are likely to have many components that, when they fail, take down the system and keep the system down until repair. Conversely, servers that are designed for great reliability often also are designed so that the systems, or at least portions of the system, can be recovered without having to keep a system down until it is repaired. So, systems with low MTBF have longer repair times, and a system with five 9s of availability is synonymous with a high level of reliability.

## 5.1  PowerVM virtualization

The PowerVM platform is the family of technologies, capabilities, and offerings that delivers industry-leading virtualization for enterprises. It is the umbrella branding term for IBM Power processor-based server virtualization:

-  IBM Power Hypervisor
-  Logical partitioning
-  IBM Micro-PartitioningÂ®
-  Virtual I/O Server (VIOS)
-  Live Partition Mobility (LPM)

PowerVM is a combination of hardware and software enablement.

Note : PowerVM Enterprise Edition License Entitlement is included with each Power10 processor-based mid-range server. PowerVM Enterprise Edition is available as a hardware feature (#EPVV); supports up to 20 partitions per core, VIOS, multiple shared processor pools (MSPPs); and also offers LPM.

## 5.1.1  IBM Power Hypervisor

IBM Power processor-based servers are combined with PowerVM technology and offer the following key capabilities that can help to consolidate and simplify IT environments:

-  Improve server usage and share I/O resources to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) and better use IT assets.
-  Improve business responsiveness and operational speed by dynamically reallocating resources to applications as needed to better match changing business needs or handle unexpected changes in demand.
-  Simplify IT infrastructure management by making workloads independent of hardware resources so that business-driven policies can be used to deliver resources that are based on time, cost, and service-level requirements.

Combined with features in the Power10 processor-based mid-range servers, the Power Hypervisor delivers functions that enable other system technologies, including logical partitioning technology, virtualized processors, IEEE virtual local area network (VLAN)-compatible virtual switches, virtual Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) adapters, virtual Fibre Channel (FC) adapters, and virtual consoles.

The Power Hypervisor is a basic component of the system's firmware and offers the following functions:

-  Provides an abstraction between the physical hardware resources and the LPARs that use them.
-  Enforces partition integrity by providing a security layer between LPARs.
-  Controls the dispatch of virtual processors to physical processors.
-  Saves and restores all processor state information during a logical processor context switch.
-  Controls hardware I/O interrupt management facilities for LPARs.

-  Provides VLAN channels between LPARs that help reduce the need for physical Ethernet adapters for inter-partition communication.
-  Monitors the enterprise Baseboard Management Controller (eBMC) and performs a reset or reload if needed, notifying the operating system (OS) if the problem is not corrected.

The Power Hypervisor is always active, regardless of the system configuration or whether it is connected to the managed console. It requires memory to support the resource assignment of the LPARs on the server. The amount of memory that is required by the Power Hypervisor firmware varies according to several factors:

-  Memory usage for hardware page tables (HPTs)
-  Memory usage to support I/O devices
-  Memory usage for virtualization

## Memory usage for hardware page tables

Each partition on the system includes its own HPT that contributes to hypervisor memory usage. The HPT is used by the OS to translate from effective addresses to real physical addresses in the hardware. This translation from effective to real addresses allows multiple OSs to run simultaneously in their own logical address space. Whenever a virtual processor for a partition is dispatched on a physical processor, the hypervisor indicates to the hardware the location of the partition HPT that can be used when translating addresses.

The amount of memory for the HPT is based on the maximum memory size of the partition and the HPT ratio. The default HPT ratio is 1/128th (for AIX, VIOS, and Linux partitions) of the maximum memory size of the partition. AIX, VIOS, and Linux use larger page sizes (16 KB and 64 KB) instead of using 4 KB pages. The use of larger page sizes reduces the overall number of pages that must be tracked; therefore, the overall size of the HPT can be reduced. For example, the HPT is 2 GB for an AIX partition with a maximum memory size of 256 GB.

When defining a partition, the maximum memory size that is specified is based on the amount of memory that can be dynamically added to the dynamic logical partition (DLPAR) without changing the configuration and restarting the partition.

In addition to setting the maximum memory size, the HPT ratio can be configured. The hpt\_ratio parameter for the chsyscfg Hardware Management Console (HMC) command can be issued to define the HPT ratio that is used for a partition profile. The valid values are 1:32, 1:64, 1:128, 1:256, or 1:512.

Specifying a smaller absolute ratio (1/512 is the smallest value) decreases the overall memory that is assigned to the HPT. Testing is required when changing the HPT ratio because a smaller HPT might incur more CPU consumption because the OS might need to reload the entries in the HPT more frequently. Most customers choose to use the IBM provided default values for the HPT ratios.

## Memory usage for I/O devices

In support of I/O operations, the hypervisor maintains structures that are called the translation control entities (TCEs), which provide an information path between I/O devices and partitions. The TCEs provide the address of the I/O buffer, indications of read versus write requests, and other I/O-related attributes. Many TCEs are used per I/O device, so multiple requests can be active simultaneously to the same physical device. To provide better affinity, the TCEs are spread across multiple processor chips or drawers to improve performance while accessing the TCEs.

For physical I/O devices, the base amount of space for the TCEs is defined by the hypervisor that is based on the number of I/O devices that are supported. A system that supports high-speed adapters can also be configured to allocate more memory to improve I/O performance. Linux is the only OS that uses these extra TCEs so that the memory can be freed for use by partitions if the system uses only AIX.

## Memory usage for virtualization features

Virtualization requires more memory to be allocated by the Power Hypervisor for hardware statesave areas and various virtualization technologies. For example, on Power10 processor-based systems, each processor core supports up to eight simultaneous multithreading (SMT) threads of execution, and each thread contains over 80 different registers.

The Power Hypervisor must set aside save areas for the register contents for the maximum number of virtual processors that are configured. The greater the number of physical hardware devices, the greater the number of virtual devices, the greater the amount of virtualization, and the more hypervisor memory is required. For efficient memory consumption, wanted and maximum values for various attributes (processors, memory, and virtual adapters) must be based on business needs, and not set to values that are higher than actual requirements.

## Predicting memory that is used by the Power Hypervisor

The IBM System Planning Tool (SPT) is a resource that can be used to estimate the amount of hypervisor memory that is required for a specific server configuration. After the SPT executable file is downloaded and installed, you can define a configuration by selecting the correct hardware platform and the installed processors and memory, and defining partitions and partition attributes. SPT can estimate the amount of memory that is assigned to the hypervisor, which helps you when you change a configuration or deploy new servers.

The Power Hypervisor provides the following types of virtual I/O adapters:

-  Virtual SCSI

The Power Hypervisor provides a virtual SCSI mechanism for the virtualization of storage devices. The storage virtualization is accomplished by using two paired adapters: a virtual SCSI server adapter and a virtual SCSI customer adapter.

-  Virtual Ethernet

The Power Hypervisor provides a virtual Ethernet switch function that allows partitions fast and secure communication on the same server without any need for physical interconnection or connectivity outside of the server if a Layer 2 bridge to a physical Ethernet adapter is set in one VIOS partition, also known as Shared Ethernet Adapter (SEA).

-  Virtual FC

A virtual FC adapter is a virtual adapter that provides customer LPARs with an FC connection to a storage area network (SAN) through the VIOS partition. The VIOS partition provides the connection between the virtual FC adapters on the VIOS partition and the physical FC adapters on the managed system.

-  Virtual (tty) console

Each partition must have access to a system console. Tasks such as OS installation, network setup, and various problem analysis activities require a dedicated system console. The Power Hypervisor provides the virtual console by using a virtual tty or serial adapter and a set of hypervisor calls to operate on them. Virtual tty does not require the purchase of any other features or software, such as the PowerVM Edition features.

## Logical partitions

Logical partitions (LPARs) and virtualization increase the usage of system resources and add a level of configuration possibilities.

Logical partitioning is the ability to make a server run as though it were two or more independent servers. When you logically partition a server, you divide the resources on the server into subsets, which are called LPARs . You can install software on an LPAR, and the LPAR runs as an independent logical server with the resources that you allocated to the LPAR.

LPAR is also referred to in some documentation as a virtual machine (VM), which makes it look like what other hypervisors offer. However, LPARs provide a higher level of security and isolation and other features that are described in this chapter.

Processors, memory, and I/O devices can be assigned to LPARs. AIX, IBM i, Linux, and VIOS can run on LPARs. VIOS provides virtual I/O resources to other LPARs with general-purpose OSs.

Note: The Power E 1050 server does not support IBM i.

LPARs share a few system attributes, such as the system serial number, system model, and processor FCs. All other system attributes can vary from one LPAR to another.

## Micro-Partitioning

When you use the Micro-Partitioning technology, you can allocate fractions of processors to an LPAR. An LPAR that uses fractions of processors is also known as a shared processor partition or micropartition . Micropartitions run over a set of processors that is called a shared processor pool (SPP), and virtual processors are used to enable the OS manage the fractions of processing power that are assigned to the LPAR.

From an OS perspective, a virtual processor cannot be distinguished from a physical processor unless the OS is enhanced to determine the difference. Physical processors are abstracted into virtual processors that are available to partitions.

On a Power10 processor-based server, a partition can be defined with a processor capacity as small as 0.05processing units. This number represents 0.05 of a physical core. Each physical core can be shared by up to 20 shared processor partitions, and the partition's entitlement can be incremented fractionally by as little as 0.05 of the processor. The shared processor partitions are dispatched and time-sliced on the physical processors under the control of the Power Hypervisor. The shared processor partitions are created and managed by the HMC.

Note: Although the Power10 processor-based mid-range server supports up to 20 shared processor partitions, the real limit depends on application workload demands in use on the server.

## Processing mode

When you create an LPAR, you can assign entire processors for dedicated use, or you can assign partial processing units from an SPP. This setting defines the processing mode of the LPAR.

## Dedicated mode

In dedicated mode, physical processors are assigned as a whole to partitions. The SMT feature in the Power10 processor core allows the core to run instructions from two, four, or eight independent software threads simultaneously.

## Shared dedicated mode

On Power10 processor-based servers, you can configure dedicated partitions to become processor donors for idle processors that they own, which allows for the donation of spare CPU cycles from dedicated processor partitions to an SPP. The dedicated partition maintains absolute priority for dedicated CPU cycles. Enabling this feature can help increase system usage without compromising the computing power for critical workloads in a dedicated processor mode LPAR.

## Shared mode

In shared mode, LPARs use virtual processors to access fractions of physical processors. Shared partitions can define any number of virtual processors (the maximum number is 20 times the number of processing units that are assigned to the partition). The Power Hypervisor dispatches virtual processors to physical processors according to the partition's processing units entitlement. One processing unit represents one physical processor's processing capacity. All partitions receive a total CPU time equal to their processing unit's entitlement. The logical processors are defined on top of virtual processors. Therefore, even with a virtual processor, the concept of a logical processor exists, and the number of logical processors depends on whether SMT is turned on or off.

## 5.1.2  Multiple shared processor pools

MSPPs are supported on Power10 processor-based servers. This capability allows a system administrator to create a set of micropartitions with the purpose of controlling the processor capacity that can be used from the physical SPP.

Micropartitions are created and then identified as members of the default processor pool or a user-defined SPP. The virtual processors that exist within the set of micropartitions are monitored by the Power Hypervisor. Processor capacity is managed according to user-defined attributes.

If the IBM Power server is under heavy load, each micropartition within an SPP is assured of its processor entitlement, plus any capacity that might be allocated from the reserved pool capacity if the micropartition is uncapped.

If specific micropartitions in an SPP do not use their processing capacity entitlement, the unused capacity is ceded, and other uncapped micropartitions within the same SPP can use the extra capacity according to their uncapped weighting. In this way, the entitled pool capacity of an SPP is distributed to the set of micropartitions within that SPP.

All IBM Power servers that support the MSPP capability have a minimum of one (the default) SPP and up to a maximum of 64 SPPs.

This capability helps customers reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) when the cost of software or database licenses depends on the number of assigned processor cores.

## 5.1.3 Virtual I/O Server

The VIOS is part of PowerVM. It is the specific appliance that allows the sharing of physical resources among LPARs to allow more efficient usage (for example, consolidation). In this case, the VIOS owns the physical I/O resources (SCSI, FC, network adapters, or optical devices) and allows customer partitions to share access to them, which minimizes and optimizes the number of physical adapters in the system.

The VIOS eliminates the requirement that every partition owns a dedicated network adapter, disk adapter, and disk drive. The VIOS supports OpenSSH for secure remote logins. It also provides a firewall for limiting access by ports, network services, and IP addresses.

Figure 5-1 shows an overview of a VIOS configuration.

Figure 5-1   Architectural view of the VIOS

<!-- image -->

It is a best practice to run dual VIOSs per physical server.

## Shared Ethernet Adapter

A SEA can be used to connect a physical Ethernet network to a virtual Ethernet network. The SEA provides this access by connecting the Power Hypervisor VLANs to the VLANs on the external switches. Because the SEA processes packets at Layer 2, the original MAC address and VLAN tags of the packet are visible to other systems on the physical network. IEEE 802.1 VLAN tagging is supported.

By using the SEA, several customer partitions can share one physical adapter. You can also connect internal and external VLANs by using a physical adapter. The SEA service can be hosted only in the VIOS (not in a general-purpose AIX or Linux partition) and acts as a Layer 2 network bridge to securely transport network traffic between virtual Ethernet networks (internal) and one or more (Etherchannel) physical network adapters (external). These virtual Ethernet network adapters are defined by the Power Hypervisor on the VIOS.

## Virtual SCSI

Virtual SCSI is used to view a virtualized implementation of the SCSI protocol. Virtual SCSI is based on a client/server relationship. The VIOS LPAR owns the physical I/O resources and acts as a server or in SCSI terms a target device. The client LPARs access the virtual SCSI backing storage devices that are provided by the VIOS as clients.

The virtual I/O adapters (a virtual SCSI server adapter and a virtual SCSI client adapter) are configured by using an HMC. The virtual SCSI server (target) adapter is responsible for running any SCSI commands that it receives, and it is owned by the VIOS partition. The virtual SCSI client adapter allows a client partition to access physical SCSI and SAN-attached devices and LUNs that are mapped to be used by the client partitions. The provisioning of virtual disk resources is provided by the VIOS.

## N\_Port ID Virtualization

N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) is a technology that allows multiple LPARs to access one or more external physical storage devices through the same physical FC adapter. This adapter is attached to a VIOS partition that acts only as a pass-through that manages the data transfer through the Power Hypervisor.

Each partition features one or more virtual FC adapters, each with their own pair of unique worldwide port names. This configuration enables you to connect each partition to independent physical storage on a SAN. Unlike virtual SCSI, only the client partitions see the disk.

For more information and requirements for NPIV, see IBM PowerVM Virtualization Managing and Monitoring , SG24-7590.

## 5.1.4 Live Partition Mobility

With LPM, you can move a running LPAR from one system to another one without disruption. Inactive partition mobility allows you to move a powered-off LPAR from one system to another one.

LPM provides systems management flexibility and improves system availability by avoiding the following situations:

-  Planned outages for hardware upgrade or firmware maintenance.
-  Unplanned downtime. With preventive failure management, if a server indicates a potential failure, you can move its LPARs to another server before the failure occurs.

For more information and requirements for LPM, see IBM PowerVM Live Partition Mobility , SG24-7460.

HMC 10.1.1020.0 and VIOS 3.1.3.21 or later provide the following enhancements to the LPM feature:

-  Automatically choose the fastest network for LPM memory transfer.
-  Allow LPM when a virtual optical device is assigned to a partition.

## 5.1.5  Active Memory Mirroring

Active Memory Mirroring (AMM) for Hypervisor is available as an option (#EM8G) to enhance resilience by mirroring critical memory that is used by the PowerVM hypervisor so that it can continue operating in a memory failure.

A portion of available memory can be proactively partitioned such that a duplicate set can be used on non-correctable memory errors. This partition can be implemented at the granularity of DIMMs or logical memory blocks.

## 5.1.6  Remote Restart

Remote Restart is a high availability (HA) option for partitions. If an error occurs that causes a server outage, a partition that is configured for Remote Restart can be restarted on a different physical server. At times, it might take longer to start the server, in which case the Remote Restart function can be used for faster reprovisioning of the partition. Typically, this task can be done faster than restarting the server that stopped and then restarting the partitions. The Remote Restart function relies on technology that is like LPM, where a partition is configured with storage on a SAN that is shared (accessible) by the server that hosts the partition.

HMC 10R1 provides an enhancement to the Remote Restart feature that enables remote restart when a virtual optical device is assigned to a partition.

## 5.1.7  IBM POWER processor modes

Although they are not virtualization features, the IBM POWER processor modes are described here because they affect various virtualization features.

On IBM Power servers, partitions can be configured to run in several modes, including the following modes:

-  Power8

This native mode for Power8 processors implements version 2.07 of the IBM Power instruction set architecture (ISA). For more information, see Processor compatibility mode definitions.

-  Power9

This native mode for Power9 processors implements version 3.0 of the IBM Power ISA. For more information, see Processor compatibility mode definitions.

-  Power10

This native mode for Power10 processors implements version 3.1 of the IBM Power ISA. For more information, see Processor compatibility mode definitions.

Figure 5-2 shows the available processor modes on a Power10 processor-based mid-range server.

Figure 5-2   Processor modes

<!-- image -->

Processor compatibility mode is important when LPM migration is planned between different generations of servers. An LPAR that might be migrated to a machine that is managed by a processor from another generation must be activated in a specific compatibility mode.

Note: Migrating an LPAR from a POWER7 processor-based server to a Power10 processor-based mid-range server by using LPM is not supported; however, the following steps can be completed to accomplish this task:

- 1. Migrate LPAR from a POWER7 processor-based server to a Power8 or Power9 processor-based server by using LPM.
- 2. Migrate the LPAR from the Power8 or Power9 processor-based server to a Power10 processor-based mid-range server.

The OS running on the POWER7 processor-based server must be supported on the Power10 processor-based mid-range server or must be upgraded to a supported level before completing these steps.

## 5.1.8 Single-root I/O virtualization

Single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) is an extension to the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) specification that allows multiple OSs to simultaneously share a PCIe adapter with little or no runtime involvement from a hypervisor or other virtualization intermediary.

SR-IOV is a PCI-standard architecture that enables PCIe adapters to become self-virtualizing. It enables adapter consolidation through sharing, much like logical partitioning enables server consolidation. With an adapter capable of SR-IOV, you can assign virtual slices of a single physical adapter to multiple partitions through logical ports, which is done without a VIOS.

## 5.1.9  More information about virtualization features

The following IBM Redbooks publications provide more information about the virtualization features:

Note: The Power E1050 server is supported by PowerVC 2.0.3 or later. If an extra fix is needed, see IBM Fix Central.

## 5.2.1  IBM PowerVC functions and advantages

When more than 70% of IT budgets are spent on operations and maintenance, IT customers legitimately expect vendors to focus their new development efforts to reduce IT costs and foster innovation within IT departments.

IBM PowerVC gives IBM Power customers the following advantages:

-  It is deeply integrated with IBM Power.
-  It provides virtualization management tools.
-  It eases the integration of servers that are managed by PowerVM in automated IT environments, such as clouds.
-  It is a building block of IBM Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which is based on IBM Power.
-  PowerVC integrated with other cloud management tools, such as Ansible, Terraform, or Red Hat OpenShift, can be integrated into orchestration tools, such as the IBM Cloud Automation Manager, VMware vRealize, or SAP Landscape Management (LaMa).
-  PowerVC also provides an exchange of VM images between private and public clouds by using the integration of IBM Cloud Object Storage into PowerVC.

IBM PowerVC is an addition to the PowerVM set of enterprise virtualization technologies that provide virtualization management. It is based on open standards and integrates server management with storage and network management.

Because IBM PowerVC is based on the OpenStack initiative, IBM Power can be managed by tools that are compatible with OpenStack standards. When a system is controlled by IBM PowerVC, it can be managed in one of three ways:

-  By a system administrator by using the IBM PowerVC GUI
-  By a system administrator that uses scripts that contain the IBM PowerVC Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interfaces (APIs)
-  By higher-level tools that call IBM PowerVC by using standard OpenStack API

The following PowerVC offerings are positioned within the available solutions for IBM Power cloud:

-  IBM PowerVC: Advanced Virtualization Management
-  IBM PowerVC for Private Cloud: Basic Cloud
-  IBM Cloud Automation Manager: Advanced Cloud
-  VMware vRealize: Advanced Cloud

PowerVC provides a systems management product that enterprise customers require to manage effectively the advanced features that are offered by IBM premium hardware. It reduces resource use and manages workloads for performance and availability.

For more information about PowerVC, see IBM PowerVC Version 2.0 Introduction and Configuration , SG24-8477.

## 5.3  Digital transformation and IT modernization

Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create business processes or modify existing ones.

It also means changing the culture and experiences to meet the changing needs of the business and the market. This reimaging of business in the digital age is digital transformation.

For IBM, digital transformation takes a customer-centric and digital-centric approach to all aspects of a business, from business models to customer experiences, processes, and operations. It uses artificial intelligence (AI), automation, hybrid cloud, and other digital technologies to use data and drive intelligent workflows, faster and smarter decision-making, and a real-time response to market disruptions. Ultimately, it changes customer expectations and creates business opportunities.

To date, one of the main technologies that is recognized to enable the digital transformation and the path to application modernization is Red Hat OpenShift. There are advantages to associate Red Hat OpenShift with the IBM Power processor-based platform.

## 5.3.1 Application and services modernization

Modernizing applications and services (both legacy and cloud-native) on containers that are deployed through a platform that is designed with Kubernetes orchestration at its core is arguably the most forward-looking strategy any business will benefit from. Unsurprisingly, it is also at the heart of the IBM and Red Hat strategy for the hybrid multicloud reality of tomorrow's digital landscape.

Red Hat OpenShift is a container orchestration platform that is based on Kubernetes that helps develop containerized applications with open-source technology. It facilitates management and deployments in hybrid and multicloud environments by using full-stack automated operations.

Containers are key elements of the IT transformation and journey toward modernization. Containers are software executable units in which the application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere, both on desktop and on any type of server or on the cloud. To do this task, containers take advantage of a form of OS virtualization in which OS functions are used effectively both to isolate processes and to control the amount of CPU, memory, and disk that those processes have access to.

Containers are small, fast, and portable because unlike a VM, they do not need to include a guest OS in every instance, and can instead use the functions and resources of the host OS.

Containers first appeared decades ago with releases such as FreeBSD jails and AIX Workload Partitions (WPARs), but most modern developers remember 2013 as the beginning of the modern container era with the introduction of Docker.

One way to better understand a container is to understand how it differs from a traditional VM. In traditional virtualization (both on-premises and in the cloud), a hypervisor is used to virtualize the physical hardware. Each VM contains a guest OS, a virtual copy of the hardware that the OS requires to run, with an application and its associated libraries and dependencies.

Instead of virtualizing the underlying hardware, containers virtualize the OS (usually Linux) so that each individual container includes only the application and its libraries and dependencies. The absence of the guest OS is the reason why containers are so light, fast, and portable.

With IBM Power, you enable the possibility of having a high container ratio per core with multiple CPU threads and co-localized cloud-native applications and applications that are related to AIX, which use API connections to business-critical data for higher bandwidth and lower latency than other technologies. Only with IBM Power do you have a flexible and efficient usage of resources, manage peaks, and support both traditional and modern workloads with the eventual support of Capacity on Demand (CoD) or sharing processor pools.

The Red Hat Ansible product complements the solution with best-in-class automation.

## 5.3.2  System automation with Ansible

Enterprises can spend much precious administrative time performing repetitive tasks and using manual processes. Tasks such as updating, patching, compliance checks, provisioning new VMs or LPARs, and helping ensure that the correct security updates are in place, are taking time away from more valuable business activities.

The ability to automate by using Ansible returns valuable time to the system administrators.

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform for IBM Power is fully enabled, so enterprises can automate several tasks within AIX and Linux that include deploying applications. Ansible can also be combined with HMC, PowerVC, and Power Virtual Server to provision infrastructure anywhere you need, including cloud solutions from other IBM Business Partners or third-party providers based on IBM Power processor-based servers.

A first task after the initial installation or setup of a new LPAR is to help ensure that the correct patches are installed. Also, extra software (whether it is open-source software, independent software vendor (ISV) software, or perhaps the business' own enterprise software) must be installed. Ansible features a set of capabilities to roll out new software, which makes it popular in Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration (CD/CI) environments. Orchestration and integration of automation with security products represent other ways in which Ansible can be applied within the data center.

Despite the wide adoption of AIX in many different business sectors by different types of customers, Ansible can help introduce IBM Power processor-based technology to customers who believe that AIX skills are a rare commodity that is difficult to find in the marketplace but want to take advantage of all the features of the hardware platform. The Ansible experience is identical across IBM Power or x86 processor-based technology, and the same steps can be repeated in IBM Cloud.

AIX skilled customers can also benefit from the extreme automation solutions that are provided by Ansible.

The IBM Power processor-based architecture features unique advantages over commodity server platforms such as x86 because the engineering teams that are working on the processor, system boards, virtualization. and management appliances collaborate closely to help ensure an integrated stack that works seamlessly. This approach is in stark contrast to the multivendor x86 processor-based technology approach, in which the processor, server, management, and virtualization must be purchased from different (and sometimes competing) vendors.

The IBM Power stack engineering teams work closely to deliver an enterprise server platform, which results in an IT architecture with industry-leading performance, scalability, and security (see Figure 5-3).

Figure 5-3   IBM Power stack

<!-- image -->

Every layer in the IBM Power stack is optimized to make the Power10 processor-based technology the platform of choice for mission-critical enterprise workloads. This stack includes the Ansible Automation Platform, which is described next.

## Ansible Automation Platform

Ansible Automation Platform integrates with IBM Power processor-based technology, which is included in the Certified Integrations section of the Red Hat Ansible website.

The various Ansible collections for IBM Power processor-based technology, which (at the time of writing) were downloaded more than 25,000 times by customers, are now included in the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. As a result, these modules are covered by the Red Hat 24x7 enterprise support team, which collaborates with the respective IBM Power processor-based technology development teams.

## IBM Power in the Ansible ecosystem

A series of Ansible collections is available for the IBM Power processor-based platform. A collection is a group of modules, playbooks, and roles. By embracing Ansible in the IBM Power community, the AIX and IBM i communities have the right set of modules that are available. Some examples are development of tools to manage AIX logical volumes, which put module interfaces over the installation key command, or managing the AIX init tab entries.

Note: The Power E 1050 server does not support IBM i.

Our OS teams develop modules that are sent to the Ansible open-source community (named Ansible Galaxy). Every developer can post any object that can be a candidate for a collection in the open Ansible Galaxy community and possibly certified to be supported by IBM with a subscription to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (see Figure 5-4).

Figure 5-4   IBM Power content in the Ansible ecosystem

<!-- image -->

## Ansible modules for AIX

The IBM Power AIX collection, as part of the broader offering of Ansible Content for IBM Power, is available from Ansible Galaxy and has community support.

The collection includes modules and sample playbooks that help to automate tasks. You can find it at this web page.

## Ansible modules for HMC

IBM Power HMC collection provides modules that can be used to manage configurations and deployments of HMC systems. The collection of content helps to include workloads on IBM Power processor-based platforms as part of an enterprise automation strategy through the Ansible ecosystem.

For more information about this collection, see this web page.

## Ansible modules for VIOS

The IBM Power VIOS collection provides modules that can be used to manage configurations and deployments of IBM Power VIOS systems. The collection content helps to include workloads on IBM Power processor-based platforms as part of an enterprise automation strategy through the Ansible system.

For more information, see this web page.

## 5.4  Protecting trust from core to cloud

The IT industry has long relied on perimeter security strategies to protect its most valuable assets, such as user data and intellectual property. Using firewalls and other network-based tools to inspect and validate users entering and leaving the network is no longer enough because digital transformation and the shift to a hybrid cloud infrastructure are changing the way industries do business.

Many organizations are also adapting their business models, and many organizations have thousands of people connecting from home computers outside the control of an IT department. Users, data, and resources are scattered worldwide, making it difficult to connect them quickly and securely. Without a traditional local infrastructure for security, employees' homes are more vulnerable to compromise, putting the business at risk.

Many companies are operating with a set of security solutions and tools even without them being fully integrated. As a result, security teams spend more time on manual tasks. They lack the context and information that are needed to effectively reduce their organization's attack surface. Rising data breaches and rising global regulations have made securing networks difficult.

Applications, users, and devices need fast and secure access to data, so much so that an entire industry of security tools and architectures was created to protect them.

Although enforcing a data encryption policy is an effective way to minimize the risk of a data breach that, in turn, minimizes costs, only a few enterprises at the worldwide level have an encryption strategy that is applied consistently across the entire organization, largely because it adds complexity, costs, and negatively affects performance, which means missed service-level agreements (SLAs) to the business.

The rapidly evolving cyberthreat landscape requires a focus on cyber-resilience. Persistent and end-to-end security is the only way to reduce exposure to threats.

## Prevention is the best protection

Since prevention is the best protection, Power10 processor-based servers provide industry-leading isolation and integrity that help prevent ransomware from being installed. The following features and implementation help customers protect their businesses:

-  Host/firmware secure and trusted boot.
-  Guest OS secure boot (AIX now, and Linux upcoming).
-  Built-in OS runtime integrity: AIX Trusted Execution, and Linux IMA.
-  The most secure multi-tenant environment with orders of magnitude lower Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) versus x86 hypervisors.
-  Orders of magnitude lower CVEs for AIX.
-  Simplified patching with PowerSC.
-  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with PowerSC MFA.

## Early detection is critical

Integrated security and compliance management with PowerSC makes it harder to misconfigure and easier to detect anomalies. Offerings such as IBM Security QRadarÂ® enhance inherent security with early anomaly detection.

## Fast and efficient recovery

It is easier to deploy resiliency strategies with IBM PowerHAÂ® and IBM Storage Safeguarded Copy, and by using IBM Storage and security services for fast detection and automated recovery of affected data.

## 5.4.1 Power10 processor-based technology-integrated security ecosystem

IBM Power processor-based platforms always offer the most secure and reliable servers in their class. Introducing Power10 processor-based technology in 2021, IBM further extended the industry-leading security and reliability of the IBM Power processor-based platform with a focus on protecting applications and data across all the hybrid cloud environments. IBM also introduced significant innovations along the following major dimensions:

-  Advanced data protection that offers simple to use and efficient capabilities to protect sensitive data through mechanisms such as encryption and MFA.
-  Platform security helps ensure that the server is hardened against tampering, continuously protects its integrity, and helps ensure strong isolation among multi-tenant workloads. Without strong platform security, all other system security measures are at risk.
-  Security innovation for modern threats helps you stay ahead of new types of cybersecurity threats by using emerging technologies.
-  Integrated security management addresses the key challenge of helping ensure correct configuration of the many security features across the stack, monitoring them, and reacting if unexpected changes are detected.

The Power10 processor-based servers are enhanced to simplify and integrate security management across the stack, which reduces the likelihood of administrator errors.

In the Power10 processor-based scale-out servers, all data is protected by a greatly simplified end-to-end encryption that extends across the hybrid cloud without detectable performance impact and prepares for future cyberthreats.

Power10 processor-core technology features built-in security integration:

-  Stay ahead of current and future data threats with better cryptographic performance and support for quantum-safe cryptography and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).
-  Enhance the security of applications with more hardened defense against return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks.
-  Simplified single-interface hybrid cloud security management without any required setup.
-  Protect your applications and data with the most secure VM isolation in the industry with orders of magnitude lower CVEs than hypervisors that are related to x86 processor-based servers.

Also, workloads on the Power10 processor-based scale-out servers benefit from cryptographic algorithm acceleration, which allows algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), SHA2, and SHA3 to run faster than Power9 processor-based servers on a per core basis. This performance acceleration allows features, such as AIX Logical Volume Encryption, to be enabled with low performance overhead.

## 5.4.2  Crypto engines and transparent memory encryption

Power10 processor-based technology is engineered to achieve faster encryption performance compared to IBM Power9 processor-based servers. Power10 processor-based scale-out servers are updated for today's most demanding standards and anticipated future cryptographic standards, such as post-quantum and FHE, and brings new enhancements to container security.

Transparent memory encryption is designed to simplify encryption and support end-to-end security without affecting performance by using hardware features for a seamless user experience. The protection that is introduced in all layers of an infrastructure is shown in Figure 5-5.

Figure 5-5 Protecting data in memory with transparent memory encryption

<!-- image -->

## 5.4.3 Quantum-safe cryptography support

To be prepared for the quantum era, the Power10 processor-based server is built to efficiently support future cryptography, such as quantum-safe cryptography and FHE. The software libraries for these solutions are optimized for the Power10 processor-based chip ISA, and they are or will be available in the respective open source communities.

Quantum-safe cryptography refers to the efforts to identify algorithms that are resistant to attacks by classical and quantum computers in preparation for the time when large-scale quantum computers are built.

Homomorphic encryption refers to encryption techniques that permit systems to perform computations on encrypted data without decrypting the data first. The software libraries for these solutions are optimized for the IBM Power processor-based chip ISA.

## 5.4.4  IBM PCIe3 Crypto Coprocessor BSC-Gen3 4769

IBM PCIe3 Crypto Coprocessor BSC-Gen3 4769 (#EJ37) provides hardware security protection for the most sensitive secrets. It supports IBM AIX, IBM i without VIOS, or supported distributions of Linux OSs.

Note: The Power E 1050 server does not support IBM i.

IBM PCIe3 Crypto Coprocessor BSC-Gen3 4769 provides a comprehensive set of cryptographic functions, including the common AES, Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES), Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), and error correction code (ECC) functions for data confidentiality and data integrity support. In addition, IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) features extensive functions for key management and many functions of special interest to the banking and finance industry.

The co-processor holds a security-enabled subsystem module and batteries for backup power. The hardened encapsulated subsystem contains two sets of two 32-bit PowerPC 476FP reduced-instruction-set-computer (RISC) processors running in lockstep with cross-checking to detect soft errors in the hardware.

It also contains a separate service processor that is used to manage:

-  Self-test and firmware updates.
-  RAM, flash memory, and battery-powered memory.
-  Secure time-of-day.
-  Cryptographic quality random number generator.
-  AES, Data Encryption Standard (DES), TDES, Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC), Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), MD5, and multiple Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) hashing methods.
-  Modular-exponentiation hardware, such as RSA and ECC.
-  Full-duplex direct memory access (DMA) communications.

A security-enabled code-loading arrangement allows control program and application program loading and refreshes after co-processor installation in your server.

IBM offers an embedded subsystem control program and a cryptographic API that implements the CCA Support Program that can be accessed from the internet at no charge to the user.

The 4769 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor is designed to deliver the following functions:

-  X.509 certificate services support.
-  American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X9 TR34-2019 key exchange services that use the public key infrastructure (PKI).
-  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) secp256k1.
-  CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a quantum-safe algorithm for digital signature generation and verification.
-  An RSA algorithm for digital signature generation and verification with keys up to 4096 bits.
-  High-throughput SHA, MD5 message digest algorithm, HMAC, CMAC, DES, TDES, and AES-based encryption for data integrity assurance and confidentiality, including AES Key Wrap (AESKW) that conforms to ANSI X9.102.
-  Elliptic-curve cryptography for digital signature and key agreement.
-  Support for smart card applications and personal identification number (PIN) processing.
-  Secure time-of-day.
-  Visa Data Secure Platform (DSP) point-to-point encryption (P2PE) with standard Visa format-preserving encryption (FPE) and format-preserving, Feistel-based Format Preserving Encryption (FF1, FF2, and FF2.1). Format Preserving Counter Mode (FPCM) is defined in ANSI x9.24 Part 2.

## 5.4.5 IBM PowerSC support

Power10 processor-based scale-out servers benefit from the integrated security management capabilities that are offered by:

-  IBM PowerSC.
-  The IBM Power software portfolio for managing security and compliance on every IBM Power processor-based platform that is running AIX.
-  The supported distributions and versions of Linux.
-  PowerSC is introducing more features to help customers manage security end-to-end across the stack to stay ahead of various threats. Specifically, PowerSC 2.0 adds support for Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), host-based intrusion detection, block listing, and Linux.

Security features are beneficial only if they can be easily and accurately managed. Power10 processor-based scale-out servers benefit from the integrated security management capabilities that are offered by IBM PowerSC, and the IBM Power software portfolio for managing security and compliance on IBM Power processor-based platforms (AIX and Linux on IBM Power).

PowerSC is sitting on top of the Power solution stack, and it provides features such as compliance automation to help with various industry standards, real-time file integrity monitoring, reporting that supports security audits, patch management, and trusted logging.

By providing all these capabilities through a web-based user interface (UI), PowerSC simplifies management of security and compliance.

PowerSC MFA provides additional assurance that only authorized people access the environments by requiring at least one extra authentication factor to prove that you are the person that you say that you are. MFA is included in PowerSC 2.0. Because stolen or guessed passwords are still one of the most common ways for hackers to get into systems, having an MFA solution in place allows you to prevent a high percentage of potential breaches.

PowerSC 2.0 also includes EDR. It provides:

## 5.4.6  Secure Boot and Trusted Boot

IBM Power servers provide a highly secure server platform. IBM Power10 processor-based hardware and firmware includes PowerVM features to provide a more secure platform for cloud deployment.

The key PowerVM features include:

-  A secure initial program load (IPL) process or the Secure Boot feature allows only correctly signed firmware components to run on the system processors. Each component of the firmware stack, including hostboot, the Power Hypervisor, and partition firmware (PFW), is signed by the platform manufacturer and verified as part of the IPL process.
-  A framework to support remote attestation of the system firmware stack through a hardware trusted platform module (TPM).

The terms Secure Boot and Trusted Boot have specific connotations. The terms are used as distinct yet complementary concepts.

## Secure Boot

The Secure Boot feature protects system integrity by using digital signatures to perform a hardware-protected verification of all firmware components. It also distinguishes between the host system trust domain and the Flexible Service Processor (FSP) trust domain by controlling service processor and service interface access to sensitive system memory regions.

## Trusted Boot

The Trusted Boot feature creates cryptographically strong and protected platform measurements that prove that particular firmware components have run on the system. You can assess the measurements by using trusted protocols to determine the state of the system and use that information for security decisions.

## 5.4.7 Enhanced CPU: baseboard management controller isolation

Separating CPU and service processor trust domains in Power10 processor-based scale-out servers improves protection from external attacks.

Power10 processor-based technology introduces innovations to address emerging threats, specifically with extra features and enhancements to defend against application domain vulnerabilities such as ROP attacks (a security exploit technique that is used by attackers to run code on a target system). This capability uses a new in-core hardware architecture that imparts minimal performance overhead (only 1 - 2% for some sample workloads tested).

The baseboard management controller (BMC) chip is connected to the two network interface cards through Network Connectivity Status Indicator (NCSI) (to support the connection to HMCs) and also have a PCIe x1 connection that connects to the backplane. This connection is used by PowerVM for partition management traffic, but it cannot be used for Guest LPAR traffic. A Guest LPAR needs its physical or virtual network interface PCIe card (or cards) for an external connection.

Hardware assist is necessary to avoid tampering with the stack. The IBM Power platform added four instructions (hashst, hashchk, hashstp, and hashchkp) to handle ROP in IBM Power ISA 3.1B.
