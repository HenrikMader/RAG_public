[ -l mount-location ] [ -o " mount-command-options " ]

[ -d remote-directory ] [ -f file ] [ --force ]

[ -i perfmon ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

bkconsdata backs  up  critical  Hardware  Management  Console  (HMC)  data,  which  is  HMC  data  that  is stored on the HMC hard disk. This backup data may be used to restore the HMC if the HMC needs to be reinstalled from the HMC recovery CDs in the event of an HMC hard disk failure.

## OPTIONS

- -r The archive option for the backup data. Valid values are usb for a USB flash memory device, ftp for a remote FTP site, sftp for a remote secure FTP (SFTP) site, nfs for an NFS file system, or none . The none option is used to remove the backup task lock allowing this task to be re-executed immediately.
- -h The host name or IP address of the remote server.

This option is required when backing up the data to a remote FTP site, SFTP site, or NFS file system.  Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP site.

This option is required when backing up the data to a remote FTP or SFTP site. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP site.

If  this  option  is  omitted  and  the  data  is  being  backed  up  to  a  remote  FTP  site,  you  will  be prompted to enter the password.  If both this option and the -k option are omitted and the data is being  backed  up  to  a  remote  SFTP  site,  you  will  be  prompted  to  enter  the  password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when backing up the data to a remote FTP or SFTP site.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If both this option and the --passwd option are omitted and the data is being backed up to a remote SFTP site, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when backing up the data to a remote SFTP site.

- -l The mount location defined on the NFS server where the backup data will be written.

This option is required when backing up the data to an NFS file system. Otherwise, this option is

not valid.

- -o Options to be passed to the mount command used to mount the NFS file system where the backup data will be written. The options must be enclosed in double quotes.

The HMC supports NFS versions 3 and 4, and this command uses version 3 by default.  To use version 4, include the option vers=4 .

This option is only valid when backing up the data to an NFS file system.

- -d The name of the directory on the remote server to which to write the backup data. If this option is not specified when backing up the data to a remote FTP or SFTP site, the backup data will be written to the user's home directory. If this option is not specified when backing up the data to an NFS file system, the backup data will be written to the mount-location on the NFS server.

This option is only valid when backing up the data to a remote FTP site, SFTP site, or NFS file system.

- -f The name of the file on the remote server to which to write the backup data. The name must start with HMCBackup\_ .

If the specified file already exists, this command will fail unless the --force option is specified.

This option is only valid when backing up the data to a remote FTP site, SFTP site, or NFS file system.

- --force When -f is specified, specify this option to allow the specified file to be overwritten if it already exists.  If it already exists and this option is not specified, the backup will fail.

This option is only valid when -f is specified.

- -i Additional data to be included in the backup data. The only valid value is perfmon to include performance monitoring data.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

chaccfg - change access control configuration

## SYNOPSIS

```
chaccfg -t { resourcerole | taskrole | autoresource | autoresourcerole } [{ -f configuration-file | -i " configuration-data " }] [ -o { enable | disable | convert | remove }] [ --retain { 0 | 1 }] [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

chaccfg changes the configuration of access control objects.

## OPTIONS

- -t The type of access control objects to change. Valid values are resourcerole for managed resource role, taskrole for task role, autoresource for automatically added managed resource object, and autoresourcerole for the automatic managed resource role update setting.
- -f The name of the file containing the configuration data needed to change an access control role. The configuration data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format. These attribute name/value pairs form a configuration record. A line feed marks the end of a configuration record. There can only be one configuration record in the file.

The format of a configuration record is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...&lt;LF&gt;

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...&lt;LF&gt;

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

If ' += ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', then the specified value is added to the existing value for the attribute if the attribute is numerical. If  the attribute is a list, then the specified value (s) is added to the existing list.

If ' -= ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', then the specified value is subtracted from the existing value for the attribute if the attribute is numerical. If the attribute is a list, then the specified value (s) is deleted from the existing list.

The ' += ' and ' -= ' operators can only be used when changing a managed resource role.

Attribute names for managed resource roles:

```
name name of the managed resource role to change (required) resources comma separated list of managed resource objects (required) Attribute names for task roles: name name of the task role to change (required) resources
```

comma separated list of tasks (required)

The -f and the -i options are mutually exclusive.

Either this option or the -i option is required when changing an access control role. This option is not valid for any other operation.

- -i This option allows you to enter configuration data on the command line, instead of using a file. Data  entered  on  the  command  line  must  follow the  same  format  as  data  in  a  file,  and  must  be enclosed in double quotes.

The -i and the -f options are mutually exclusive.

Either this option or the -f option is required when changing an access control role. This option is not valid for any other operation.

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are enable to enable automatic updates of custom managed resource roles, disable to disable automatic updates of custom managed resource roles, convert to convert all automatically added managed resource objects to user-added managed resource objects, and remove to remove all automatically added managed resource objects.

This option is required when changing automatically added managed resource objects or the automatic managed resource role update setting. This option is not valid for any other operation.

## --retain

When disabling automatic updates of custom managed resource roles, specify whether automatically  added  managed  resource  objects  are  to  be  removed or converted  to  user-added  managed resource objects. Valid values are 0 to remove and 1 to convert.

This option is required when disabling automatic updates of custom managed resource roles. This option is not valid for any other operation.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Change the managed resource objects for the managed resource role lpar\_role where XXX is a resource name returned from lsaccfg -t resource --script :

## chaccfg -t resourcerole -i "name=lpar\_role,resources=XXX"

Add a managed resource object to the managed resource role mr1 where XXX is a resource name returned from lsaccfg -t resource --script :

chaccfg -t resourcerole -i "name=mr1,resources+=XXX"

Change the task role tr1 :

chaccfg -t taskrole -i "name=tr1,"resources= cec:ChangeCECProperty+CECPowerOn+CECPowerOff, lpar:ChangeLPARProperty+ChangeProfileProperty""

Change a task role using the configuration data in the file /tmp/cfgFile :

```

## DESCRIPTION

chcodpool performs Capacity on Demand (CoD) Power enterprise pool operations.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are update to update a Power enterprise pool, add to add Mobile CoD resources to a system in a pool or to add a managing HMC to a pool, remove to remove Mobile CoD resources from a system in a pool or to remove a managing HMC from a pool, auth to  reauthenticate  a  managing  HMC  in  a  pool, set to  set  an  attribute  of  a  managing HMC, setcontroller to change the controller HMC for a pool, recover to recover a pool after a clean  install  of  the  controller  HMC  for  the  pool,  and sync to  synchronize  the  pool  information between the controller HMC for a pool, the managing HMCs in the pool, and the systems in the pool.
- -p The name of the Power enterprise pool for which to perform the operation.

Except when recovering a pool, you can either use this option to specify the name of the pool, or use the --id option to specify the pool's ID.  The --id option must be used if there are multiple Power enterprise pools with the same name. The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

When recovering a pool, you must use this option to specify a name for the pool being recovered.

- --id The ID of the Power enterprise pool for which to perform the operation.

You can either use this option to specify the ID of the pool, or use the -p option to specify the pool's name.  The --id option must be used if there are multiple Power enterprise pools with the same name. The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

- -m The name of the managed system to which to add or remove Mobile CoD resources. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -r The  type  of  Mobile  CoD  resources  to  add  or  remove. Valid  values  are mem for  Mobile  CoD memory, and proc for Mobile CoD processors.
- -q The number of Mobile CoD processors or the amount of Mobile CoD memory to add or remove. The number of processors must be a whole number. The amount of memory must be specified in megabytes and must be a multiple of gigabytes.
- -f The name of the XML file that contains the Power enterprise pool configuration data. If file is not fully qualified, file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

If file exists on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

This option must be specified when updating which systems are members of a Power enterprise pool, or when updating the amount of Mobile CoD resources in a pool. This option must also be specified when recovering a pool following the clean install of the controller HMC for the pool.

- -a The Power enterprise pool attributes to update or recover.  The attribute data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The format of the attribute data is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Valid attribute names for updating a pool:

new\_name

Valid attribute names for recovering a pool:

mcs

Comma separated list of managing HMCs for the pool, with each managing HMC having the following format:

host-name-or-IP-address / user-ID / [ password ][ / [ restricted-ops ]]

The first 2 ' / ' characters must be present. The 3rd

' / ' character is optional, but it must be present if restricted-ops is specified.

Optional values may be omitted. Optional values are password and restricted-ops . If password is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.

Valid values for restricted-ops :

- 0 - users are not restricted from initiating add and remove Mobile CoD resource operations from this managing HMC (default value)
- 1 - users are restricted from initiating add and remove Mobile CoD resource operations from this managing HMC

Note: do not include the HMC which is running this command in the list.

## For example:

hmc1/user1/ prompts the user for user1 's password then uses that password and the user ID user1 to log into the HMC with host name hmc1 to add that HMC to the pool.

- --mc Specify the HMC host name or IP address. When setting a new controller HMC for the Power enterprise pool, you can specify this to set the HMC running this command as the new controller.

When setting a new controller HMC for the pool, if the current controller HMC for the pool is running you can run this command from any managing HMC and set any managing HMC in the pool as the new controller. If the current controller HMC for the pool is not running or not reachable, you must run this command on the HMC that you want to set as the new controller and you must specify the --force option.

- -u Specify the user ID to use to log into the managing HMC being added or reauthenticated.

## --passwd

Specify the password for user-ID . If this option is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.

## --restrictedops

Specify whether or not users are restricted from initiating add and remove Mobile CoD resource operations from the specified managing HMC. Valid values are 0 if users are not restricted, and 1 if they are restricted. If this option is omitted, it defaults to 0 .

This option does not apply to the controller HMC for the pool.

This option is only valid when performing a managing HMC add or set operation.

- --force Specify this option to force a Mobile CoD add or remove operation to occur for a system that is not  currently  reachable  from  the  controller  HMC  for  the  pool. If  Mobile  CoD  resources  are removed from a system that is not currently reachable from the controller HMC, those resources will be considered unreturned until the system can be reached from the controller HMC again. A grace period compliance timer will be started for that system as soon as the resources are removed. To add Mobile CoD resources to a system that is not currently reachable from the controller HMC for the pool, the system must have unreturned Mobile CoD resources, and you cannot add more Mobile CoD resources to the system than are unreturned on that system.

When setting a new controller HMC for a pool, you must specify this option to force the HMC to set itself as the new controller HMC for a pool when the current controller HMC for the pool is not running or not reachable.

When removing a managing HMC from the pool, you must specify this option if the HMC you want to remove is the only HMC managing one or more systems in the pool.

## --forcenoconn

Specify this option to remove  a  managing HMC from a pool when the controller HMC for the pool is not able to reach the managing HMC. After the HMC is removed from the pool, the pool data will remain on the managing HMC but will no longer be updated. To  remove the pool data from the managing HMC, you must perform a clean install of the HMC.

- -v Specify this option to enable verbose mode. When verbose mode is enabled, warning messages and informational messages are displayed for successful update pool and recover pool operations. Warning  messages  and  informational  messages  are  displayed  for  update  pool  and  recover pool operations that partially succeed or fail, regardless of whether this option is specified.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXIT STATUS

This command has the following return codes:

- 0 Success
- 100 Partial success

This value is returned when at least one portion of an update pool or recover pool operation succeeded, and at least one failed.

Any other value means the command failed.

## NAME

chcomgmt - change co-management settings

## SYNOPSIS

chcomgmt -m managed-system -o { setcontroller | relcontroller }

[ -t { norm | keep }] [ --force ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

chcomgmt changes co-management settings for the managed-system .

This command is used to set or release this Hardware Management Console (HMC) as the PowerVM management controller for the managed system. You must set this HMC as the PowerVM management controller  for  a  managed  system  when  you  want  to  perform  an  operation  from  this  HMC  that  requires  this HMC to be the PowerVM management controller. In addition, you can choose to set this HMC as the PowerVM management controller for a managed system when you want this HMC to be the only HMC that can perform PowerVM management for the managed system. Other HMCs would be able to perform PowerVM view operations only.

## OPTIONS

- -m The name of the managed system for which to change co-management settings. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form  must  be  used  if  there  are  multiple  managed  systems  with  the same user-defined name.
- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are setcontroller to set this HMC as the PowerVM management controller for the managed system, and relcontroller to  release this HMC as the PowerVM management controller for the managed system.
- -t The type of PowerVM management controller to set. Valid values are norm to set this HMC as a normal controller, and keep to set this HMC as a persistent controller.

If you set this HMC as the PowerVM management controller for a managed system, it is recommended that you release it as controller as soon as controller mode is no longer needed, unless you want this HMC to remain the only HMC that can perform PowerVM management for the managed system.  If you  choose  normal  controller  mode  and  you  do  not  release  it,  it  will  be  gracefully released  when  another  PowerVM  manager, such  as  another  HMC,  sets  itself  as  the  PowerVM management controller for the managed system. If you choose persistent controller mode and you do not release it, no other PowerVM manager will be able to set itself as the PowerVM management controller for the managed system without forcing the operation. It is recommended that you do not choose persistent controller mode unless directed to do so by your hardware service representative.

To set this HMC as the persistent controller for a managed system, you must first set this HMC as the normal controller, unless there is no current PowerVM management controller for the managed system.  Once this HMC is the current controller, then you can set this HMC as the persistent controller. If there is no current PowerVM management controller for the managed system, you can immediately set this HMC as the persistent controller without setting it as the normal controller first.

This  option  is  required  when  setting  the  PowerVM  management  controller. This  option  is  not valid otherwise.

- --force Specify this option to force this HMC to be set as the PowerVM management normal controller for the managed system. Use this option when you are not able to get the current PowerVM management controller to release itself as the controller. Warning: use this option carefully. Forcing the set controller operation can result in any operations in progress on the current PowerVM  management  controller  to  fail,  which  can  have  unexpected  impacts  on  managed

## system and partition configuration and states.

If  the  current  PowerVM management controller for the managed system is in normal controller mode, you must first try to set this HMC as the normal controller without using the --force option. After doing so, if this HMC remains in pending controller mode, then you can immediately set this HMC as the normal controller by running this command again using the --force option.  If the current  PowerVM management controller for the managed system is in persistent controller mode, you can immediately set this HMC as the normal controller by using the --force option.

This option is only valid when setting this HMC as the PowerVM management normal controller for a managed system.

## EXAMPLES

Set this HMC as the PowerVM management normal controller for managed system sys1 :

## chcomgmt -m sys1 -o setcontroller -t norm

Release this HMC as the PowerVM management controller for managed system sys1 :

## chcomgmt -m sys1 -o relcontroller

## DESCRIPTION

chhmc changes Hardware Management Console (HMC) configuration information, such as remote access settings and network settings.

## OPTIONS

- -c The type of configuration to be modified. Valid values are ssh , syslog , xntp , netroute , network , netbond , kbdcfg , dispcfg , altdiskboot , locale , service , date , remotewebui , kerberos , imm , sol for  Serial  Over  LAN, security , emch for  Event  Manager  for  Call  Home, grubpasswd , bmc , userdefinfo , and powerscuiagent .

For configuring the firewall settings, the valid service s are SecureRemoteAccess.name , RMC.name , FCS.name , i5250.name , ping.name , ntp.name , RPD.name , snmptrap.name , and snmpagent.name .

- -s The new state value of the configuration. Valid values are enable , disable , add , modify , remove , and restart .
- -i The interface to configure, such as eth0 or sl0 .

If this option is omitted when adding a static route, the route will be added for each interface.

When configuring a network bond, exactly two comma-separated interfaces must be specified.

When configuring firewall settings, a network bond name can be specified with this option.

- -a The network IP address.

For network interface configuration, this is the static IP address configuration. Valid values are:

## --ipv6dhcp

The IPv6 DHCP setting for the network interface.

Valid values are:

on

- obtain an IPv6 address automatically via DHCP

off - do not obtain an IPv6 address automatically via DHCP

## --ipv4dhcp

The IPv4 DHCP setting for the network interface or the BMC.

Valid values are:

on - obtain an IPv4 address automatically via DHCP

off - do not obtain an IPv4 address automatically via DHCP

This option cannot be used if a static IPv4 address has also been specified with the -a option.

none - no static IP address configured list - specify a comma-separated list of static IP addresses.  The list can contain zero or one static IPv4 address and zero or more static IPv6 addresses in the following format: static-address / prefix-length

For DHCP server configuration, you can specify a custom or preconfigured HMC DHCP server IPv4  address. If  you  specify  a  custom  address,  you  must  also  specify  the -nm and --range options.  For a list of all preconfigured HMC DHCP server addresses, issue the lshmc -D command.

For all other operations except Kerberos, IMM, BMC, and network bond configuration, an IPv4 or IPv6 address can be specified.

For Kerberos configuration, use this  option  to  specify  the  IPv4  address  of  the  Key  Distribution Center (KDC). An optional port number can be specified following the IPv4 address. If the KDC has an IPv6 address, then you cannot use this option to specify the IP address of the KDC. You must use the -h option to specify the host name of the KDC instead. Either this option or the -h option to specify the KDC is required for a Kerberos add or remove operation.  This option is not valid for a Kerberos modify operation.

- -nm The IPv4 network mask.
- --ipv6 Specify  this  option  to  enable  or  disable  IPv6  on  the  HMC. When disabled, no link-local  IPv6 addresses will be automatically assigned to the HMC network interfaces.

IPv6 is enabled by default on the HMC.

## --ipv6auto

The IPv6 autoconfiguration setting for the network interface.

Valid values are:

on - autoconfigure IPv6 addresses off - do not autoconfigure IPv6 addresses

## --ipv6privacy

The IPv6 privacy extension setting for the network interface.

Valid values are:

on - use privacy extensions for autoconfiguration off - do not use privacy extensions for autoconfiguration

## --lparcomm

The partition communication setting for the network interface.

This option has been deprecated. Use the chpsm command to configure which network interfaces are enabled for partition communication.

- --tso The TCP segmentation offload (TSO) setting for the network interface.

```
Valid values are: on - enable TSO off - disable TSO
```

--speed The speed setting for the network interface.

```
Valid values are:
```

```
auto - automatically detect and set speed 10 - 10Mbps 100 - 100Mbps
```

1000 - 1000Mbps

Specify auto unless you have a requirement to use a fixed speed setting.

The duplex setting for the network interface.

```
Valid values are: - automatically detect and set duplex
```

```
auto half - half duplex full - full duplex
```

Specify auto unless you have a requirement to use a fixed duplex setting.

```

## --jumboframe

Enables or disables jumbo frames on the network interface. The jumbo frame size is 9000 bytes.

```
Valid values are: on - enable jumbo frames off - disable jumbo frames
```

Do not enable jumbo frames on the network interface that is used to connect to managed systems  or  managed  frames.  Managed  systems  and  managed  frames  do  not  support  jumbo frames.

- -d The network domain name.
- -h The host name.

For Kerberos configuration, use this option to specify the host name of the Key Distribution Center (KDC).  An optional  port  number  can  be  specified  following  the  host  name. Also,  either  this option or the -a option to specify the KDC is required for a Kerberos add or remove operation.

are:

## --duplex

## --range

This option is not valid for a Kerberos modify operation.

- -g The default gateway IP address.
- -ns The nameserver IP address to add or remove.
- --dns Specify this option to enable or disable DNS on the HMC.
- -ds The domain suffix to add or remove.

## --dhcpserver

Enables or disables the network interface as a DHCP server.

Valid values are:

on - enable DHCP server off - disable DHCP server

The range of IPv4 addresses the DHCP server can lease. range must be specified using the following format:

starting-IPv4-address , ending-IPv4-address

This option is required when configuring a custom DHCP server address and is not valid otherwise.

## --routetype

The type of static route to add. Valid values are host to add a static route to a host and net to add a static route to a network.

## --position

The position in the routing table of the static route to add or remove.

When adding a static route, if this option is omitted or if the position specified is greater than the position of the first default route entry, the route entry will be added to the routing table just before the first default route entry.

The lshmc --netroute command can be used to display the position of all of the static route entries in the routing table.

- -b The name of the network bond to modify or remove. When a network bond is added, the HMC assigns a name to the network bond that the user cannot change. The lshmc --netbond command can be used to display the network bond names.

When modifying or removing a network bond, this option is required. This option is not valid for any other operation.

## --source

When adding a network bond, you can use this option to specify the network interface from which you want to obtain the network and firewall settings for the bond.

This option is only valid when adding a network bond.

## --primary

When adding or modifying a network bond with a bonding mode of active-backup, use this option to specify which bond interface is to be active first.

This  option  is  only  valid  when  adding  or  modifying  a  network  bond  with  a  bonding  mode  of active-backup.

When configuring the HMC BMC settings, specify the BMC interface mode. Valid values are ded for dedicated, shared , and failover . If this option is omitted on an HMC with a single BMC interface, it will default to the type of that interface.  If this option is omitted on an HMC with both a dedicated and a shared BMC interface, it will default to dedicated. The failover mode is only supported on the Power HMC CR1.

When configuring  the  HMC  security  mode,  valid  values  are legacy for  no  security  mode,  and nist\_sp800\_131a for NIST SP 800-131A (National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication  800-131A).  The  default  value  is legacy . The  HMC will  automatically  be  restarted after the security mode is changed.

When adding or modifying a network bond, specify the bonding mode. Valid values are activebackup for active-backup, and roundrobin for round-robin. When adding a network bond, the default value is roundrobin .

## --vlanid

The VLAN ID for the BMC network interface.  Valid values are off to disable VLAN and 1 -4094 to enable VLAN and set the specified value as the VLAN ID.

## --vlanpriority

The VLAN priority for the BMC network interface.  Valid values are 0 -7 .

You must reboot the HMC after setting the time zone.

The Kerberos realm name.

When the first  Kerberos  realm  and  KDC  is  added  to  the  HMC,  that  realm  is  set  as  the  default

## --realm

realm  and  Kerberos  is  automatically  enabled  on  the  HMC. When the last  Kerberos  realm  and KDC  is  removed from  the  HMC,  Kerberos  is  automatically  disabled  on  the  HMC. Then,  if another Kerberos realm and KDC is added to the HMC, Kerberos will automatically be enabled again, and the default realm will be set to the new realm.  There is no other way to enable or disable Kerberos on the HMC.

This option is required for a Kerberos add or remove operation.  This option is not valid for a Kerberos modify operation.

## --defaultrealm

## DESCRIPTION

chhmccert changes the Hardware Management Console (HMC) certificate, or adds or removes a certificate to or from the HMC's truststore.  The HMC will automatically be restarted to apply the certificate changes.

chhmccert also changes the expiration date for the certificate on this HMC used for HMC to HMC communication.  An HMC restart is required to apply the certificate change on this HMC. After this HMC is restarted, communication from this HMC to other HMCs cannot be reestablished until the cpfile command is used to copy and apply this certificate to the other HMCs.

chhmccert also changes the HMC default setting for the number of days until certificate expiration.  The new default setting will be applied to newly created certificates or certificate signing requests only.

## OPTIONS

-o The operation to perform. Valid values are apply to apply a certificate, archiverm to delete and archive the current certificate, add to add a certificate as trusted to the HMC's truststore, remove to  remove  a  trusted  certificate  from  the  HMC's truststore,  and set to  change  the  HMC  default

setting for the number of days until certificate expiration.

- -t The type of certificate to apply, add, or remove. Valid values are self to apply changes to a selfsigned certificate, cacert to apply an imported CA signed certificate, repo to apply an imported certificate repository, archivecert to apply the previously archived certificate, trustedcert to add or remove a trusted certificate, and fcs to apply changes to the certificate used for HMC to HMC communication.
- -f The name of the file containing the CA signed certificate or certificate repository to import and apply, or the certificate to add as trusted to the HMC's truststore.

When adding a certificate as trusted this option is required when the certificate is located on a USB data storage device, an SFTP server, or the HMC hard disk. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -s The name of file containing the signing certificate to import. Multiple file names can be specified with this option. Multiple file names must be comma separated.

This option is only valid when importing and applying a CA signed certificate.

- -l The location where the CA signed certificate, certificate repository, or certificate to be added as trusted  is  located. Valid  values  are usb for  a  USB  data  storage  device, sftp for  a  secure  FTP (SFTP) server, or trustedsslserver for a trusted server.

If this option is not specified, the CA signed certificate, certificate repository, or certificate to be added as trusted will be imported from the HMC hard disk.

- -h The host name or IP address of the SFTP server where the CA signed certificate, certificate repository, or certificate to be added as trusted is located, or the host name or IP address of the trusted server where the certificate to be added as trusted is located.

This option is required when the CA signed certificate or certificate repository is located on an SFTP server, and when the certificate to be added as trusted is located on an SFTP server or a trusted server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the SFTP server.

This option is required when the CA signed certificate, certificate repository, or certificate to be added as trusted is located on an SFTP server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the SFTP server.

If both this option and the -k option are omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when the CA signed certificate, certificate repository, or certificate to be added as trusted is located on an SFTP server.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If both this option and the --passwd option are omitted and the CA signed certificate or certificate repository is located on an SFTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and

--passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when the CA signed certificate, certificate repository, or certificate to be added as trusted is located an SFTP server.

- -d The directory where the CA signed certificate, certificate repository, or certificate to be added as trusted is located.

When adding a certificate as trusted this option is required when the certificate is located on a USB data storage device, an SFTP server, or the HMC hard disk. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -i The input data for the command. The input data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The format of the input data is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

If ' += ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', the specified value is added to the existing list.

If ' -= ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', the specified value is deleted from the existing list.

Valid attribute names for this command:

## SYNOPSIS

chhmcencr -c { passwd | webui | ssh | sshmac | sshkey } -o { a | r | s } -e encryption [ -r ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

chhmcencr changes which encryption is used by the Hardware Management Console (HMC) to encrypt the passwords of locally authenticated HMC users. The new encryption will be used when a locally authenticated HMC user is created, or when the password for a locally authenticated HMC user is changed. The passwords of existing locally authenticated HMC users will not be affected by the encryption change until the passwords for those users are changed.

chhmcencr also changes which encryption ciphers can be used by the HMC Web user interface. The HMC will automatically be restarted after any HMC Web user interface encryption ciphers are changed.

chhmcencr also changes which encryption ciphers, Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms, and key exchange algorithms can be used by the HMC Secure Shell (SSH) interface.

## OPTIONS

- -c The  encryption  configuration  to  change. Valid  values  are passwd to  change  which  password encryption is used for locally authenticated HMC users, webui to change which encryption ciphers can be used by the HMC Web user interface, ssh to change which encryption ciphers can be used by the HMC SSH interface, sshmac to change which MAC algorithms can be used by the HMC SSH interface, or sshkey to change which key exchange algorithms can be used by the HMC SSH interface.
- -o The operation to perform.

Specify a to add one or more encryption ciphers to the list of encryption ciphers currently supported by the HMC Web user interface or SSH interface.  Also specify a to add one or more MAC or key exchange algorithms to the list of MAC or key exchange algorithms currently supported by the HMC SSH interface.

Specify r to remove one or more encryption ciphers from the list of encryption ciphers currently supported  by  the  HMC  Web  user  interface  or  SSH  interface.  Also specify r to  remove  one  or more MAC or key exchange algorithms from the list of MAC or key exchange algorithms currently supported by the HMC SSH interface.

Specify s to set the encryption to use to encrypt the passwords of locally authenticated HMC users for all subsequent user creations and user password modifications.

- -e The password encryption, encryption cipher, MAC algorithm, or key exchange algorithm to add, remove, or set. When adding or removing encryption ciphers or MAC or key exchange algorithms, multiple  encryption  ciphers  or  MAC or key  exchange  algorithms  can  be  specified  and  must  be comma separated. Encryption ciphers and MAC and key exchange algorithms are added to the end of their lists. The order of the encryption ciphers and MAC and key exchange algorithms in their lists is the order the HMC attempts to use them.

A list  of  all  of  the  HMC  password  encryptions,  encryption  ciphers,  MAC algorithms,  and  key exchange algorithms available on the HMC can be obtained from the lshmcencr command.

- -r When changing the encryption ciphers that can be used by the HMC Web user interface, specify this option to cause the HMC to automatically be restarted without asking for confirmation.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## DESCRIPTION

chhmcldap changes the Hardware Management Console (HMC) Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) client configuration.

By default, LDAP is not configured on the HMC. The HMC can only be configured as an LDAP client. To configure the HMC as an LDAP client, issue this command and specify both the primary LDAP server and the base Distinguished Name (DN) at a minimum.

The getfile command can be used to deploy an LDAP Certificate  Authority  (CA)  certificate  file  on  the HMC.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are s to set an HMC LDAP configuration attribute, and r to remove an LDAP resource or the LDAP configuration from the HMC.
- -r The LDAP resource to remove. Valid values are backup to remove the backup LDAP server, ldap to  unconfigure  LDAP  on  the  HMC, binddn to  remove  the  bind  Distinguished  Name  (DN), bindpw to remove the bind password, searchfilter to remove the LDAP search filter, and hmcgroups to remove the HMC user group configuration.

This option is required for a remove operation.  This option is not valid for a set operation.

## --primary

The  primary  LDAP  server. The  Uniform  Resource  Identifier  (URI)  scheme  may  be ldap:// for LDAP over TCP, or ldaps:// for LDAP over SSL.  The URI format is ldap:// LDAP-server [ : portnumber ] or ldaps:// LDAP-server [ : port-number ]. LDAP-server can either be the host name or the IP address of the LDAP server. The port number is optional. If the port number is omitted, port 389 is used for the ldap:// scheme and port 636 is used for the ldaps:// scheme.  If Start TLS is enabled, the URI must use the ldap:// scheme.

If LDAP is not configured on the HMC, both this option and the --basedn option must be specified

|

to configure LDAP on the HMC.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --backup

The backup LDAP server. The URI scheme may be ldap:// for LDAP over TCP, or ldaps:// for LDAP  over SSL. The URI  format  is ldap:// LDAP-server [ : port-number ] or ldaps:// LDAPserver [ : port-number ]. LDAP-server can either be the host name or the IP address of the LDAP server. The port number is optional. If the port number is omitted, port 389 is used for the ldap:// scheme and port 636 is used for the ldaps:// scheme.  If Start TLS is enabled, the URI must use the ldap:// scheme.

This option is only valid for a set operation. Setting a backup LDAP server is optional.

## --basedn

The  base  DN  for  LDAP  search.  Base  DNs  must  be  specified  in  LDAP  format  (e.g. dc=ldapclient,dc=example,dc=com ).

Multiple base DNs can be specified for LDAP search. When multiple base DNs are specified, they must be specified in comma separated value (CSV) format.

If LDAP is not configured on the HMC, both this option and the --primary option must be specified to configure LDAP on the HMC.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --binddn

The DN to use for binding to the LDAP server when the LDAP server is configured to use nonanonymous binding. The bind DN must be specified in LDAP format (e.g. cn=admin,dc=yourorg,dc=com ).

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --bindpw

The password to use when binding to the LDAP server when the LDAP server is configured to use non-anonymous binding.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --timelimit

The LDAP search time limit in seconds. A value of 0 means there is no time limit. If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, the search time limit is set to 30 seconds.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --bindtimelimit

The LDAP server bind time limit in seconds. If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, the bind time limit is set to 30 seconds.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --automanage

Use this option to indicate whether the HMC should automatically manage remotely authenticated LDAP users. Valid values are 0 to disable automatic management, or 1 to enable automatic management.

When automatic management is enabled, an LDAP user can log in to the HMC. An HMC user will be automatically created for the LDAP user if the HMC user does not exist when the LDAP user logs in. If  the  HMC user already exists, it will be updated with the current user definition

retrieved from the LDAP server when the LDAP user logs in.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, automatic management is disabled.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

- --auth The type of authentication to use for automatically managed LDAP users. Valid values are ldap to use LDAP authentication, or kerberos to use Kerberos authentication.

If kerberos is specified and Kerberos is not enabled on the HMC, LDAP users will not be able to log in to the HMC because the HMC will not be able to retrieve the user data from the LDAP server.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, LDAP authentication will be used.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --loginattribute

The login attribute to use to authenticate LDAP users on the HMC. The value of the login attribute stored  on  the  LDAP  server  is  compared  with  the  HMC  user  name.  If  a  match  is  found  on  the LDAP server, then authentication with the LDAP server is attempted.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, the login attribute is set to uid .

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --hmcuserpropsattribute

The attribute to use to retrieve  the user roles and properties from the LDAP server. These user roles and properties are used when the HMC user is created or updated for an automatically managed LDAP user.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, this attribute is set to ibm-aixAdminPolicyEntry .

This option is only valid for a set operation.

For information about how to configure this attribute on your LDAP server, please refer to the GUI help text for the Users and Security &gt; Systems and Console Security &gt; Manage LDAP GUI task.

## --hmcauthnameattribute

The  attribute  to  use  to  retrieve  the  remote  user  ID  used  in  Kerberos  authentication. When the HMC user  is  created  or  updated  for  an  automatically  managed  LDAP  user, the  HMC  user  is assigned this remote user ID if Kerberos authentication is used.

If  this  option  is  not  specified  when  LDAP  is  configured,  this  attribute  is  set  to userPrincipalName .

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --searchfilter

The filter to use for limiting the search of the LDAP server for user information. This is useful when you have a large number of LDAP users and you want to decrease the amount of time for retrieving the user information.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, then no filter is set.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

--scope The search scope starting from base DN. Valid values are one to search one level or sub to search the subtree. This is useful when you want to search for users in different organizations.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, the search scope is set to one level.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --referrals

Specifies whether automatic referral chasing is to be enabled or disabled. Valid values are 0 to disable automatic referral chasing, and 1 to enable it. If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, automatic referral chasing is enabled.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --starttls

Specifies whether Start Transport Layer Security (TLS) is to be enabled or disabled. Valid values are 0 to disable Start TLS, and 1 to enable it. This option can only be enabled if the LDAP server supports the Start TLS protocol. When Start TLS is enabled, a connection is opened using the normal LDAP port. Then, when needed (for example when binding), the connection is converted to  a  SSL  connection  using  the  Start  TLS  protocol.  This  functionality  exists,  for  example,  in OpenLDAP. When Start TLS is enabled, the URI scheme ldap:// must be used.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, Start TLS is disabled.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --hmcgroups

Specifies the name of one or more user groups allowed to log in to this HMC. Multiple group names must be comma separated. The user groups specified with this option will replace the current user groups configured for this HMC.

If this option is not specified when LDAP is configured, no HMC user groups will be configured and all LDAP users will be allowed to log in to this HMC.

This option is only valid for a set operation.

## --authsearch

Specifies whether the HMC will attempt an LDAP search, with the user's credentials, as an additional confirmation that the bind operation was successful. Valid values are base to perform the default search, and none to perform no search. If this option is not specified, it defaults to base .

This option is only valid for a set operation.

Display the help text for this command and exit.

To change the attributes of a Hardware Management Console (HMC) user: chhmcusr -u user-name -t { assign | desc | passwd | pwage | taskrole | auth | remoteuser } [ -o { a | r }] [ -r { resource | resourcerole }] [ -v new-attribute-value ] [ --remoteuser remote-user-name ] [ --localpasswd password ] [ --help ] or chhmcusr { -f input-data-file | -i " input-data " } [ --help ] To change the default settings of HMC user attributes: chhmcusr -t default { -f input-data-file | -i " input-data " } [ --help ] To enable an HMC user that was disabled due to inactivity: chhmcusr -u user-name -o e [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

chhmcusr changes the attributes of an HMC user.

chhmcusr also  changes  the  default  settings  of  HMC  user  attributes. The new default  settings  will  be applied to newly created HMC users only.

chhmcusr can also be used to enable an HMC user that was disabled due to activity.

## OPTIONS

- -u The user name of the HMC user to change or enable.

When changing an HMC user, you can either use this option or use the name attribute with the -f or -i option, to specify the user name. The -u , -f , and -i options are mutually exclusive.

- -t When changing the attribute of an HMC user, specify which user attribute to change. Valid values are assign for the user's access control managed resource object assignment or managed resource role assignment, desc for the user's description, passwd for the user's password, pwage for the number of days until the user's password expires, taskrole for the user's access control task role, auth for  the  user's authentication  type,  and remoteuser for  the  user's remote user ID used for remote Kerberos authentication.

Only users that have the hmcsuperadmin task role, or that have the ManageAllUserPasswords task in their task role, are authorized to change other locally authenticated user's passwords.  The password for a remotely authenticated Kerberos user can be changed only by that user. Passwords for remotely authenticated LDAP users cannot be changed.

Password expirations can be changed for locally authenticated users only.

You can either use this option, or use the -f or -i option, to specify the user attribute(s) to change. The -t , -f , and -i options are mutually exclusive.

When changing the default settings of HMC user attributes, specify default with this option.

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are a to add a managed resource object or role to the user, r to remove a managed resource object or role from the user, and e to enable a user that was disabled due to inactivity.

This option is required when changing the user's managed resource object assignment. You can either use this option, or use the resourcerole attribute with the -f or -i option, to change the user's managed resource role assignment. The -o , -f , and -i options are mutually exclusive.

This option is also required when enabling the user. Only users that have the hmcsuperadmin task role are authorized to enable users that have been disabled due to inactivity.

- -r The type of access control assignment to change. Valid values are resource for managed resource object assignment and resourcerole for managed resource role assignment.

This option is required when the -o option is used to change the user's managed resource object assignment or managed resource role assignment. This option is not valid otherwise.

- -v The new value for the attribute being changed.

When  changing  the  user's managed  resource  object  assignment,  specify  the  managed  resource object to be added or removed.

When  changing  the  user's managed  resource  role  assignment,  specify  one  or  more  managed resource roles to be added or removed.  Multiple managed resource roles must be comma separated.

When  changing  the  user's description,  specify  the  new description  with  this  option. The  new description can be any string.

When changing the user's password, you can either specify the new password with this option, or you can omit this option and you will be prompted to enter the password.

When changing the number of days until the user's password expires, specify the new number of days with this option.

When changing  the  user's access  control  task  role,  specify  the  new task  role  with  this  option. Valid  values  are hmcsuperadmin , hmcoperator , hmcviewer , hmcpe , hmcservicerep , hmcclientliveupdate , or a user-defined task role.

When  changing  the  user's authentication  type,  specify  the  new authentication  type  with  this option.  Valid values are local , kerberos , or ldap .

When changing the user's remote user ID used for remote Kerberos authentication, specify the new remote user ID with this option.

This option is required when the -t option is specified to change any user attribute other than the user's password.

You can either use this option, or use the -f or -i option, to specify the new user attribute value(s). The -v , -f , and -i options are mutually exclusive.

## --remoteuser

The remote user ID used for remote Kerberos authentication for this user. This is the user's Kerberos principal. The format of a typical Kerberos principal is primary / instance @ REALM .

The  remote  user  ID  must  be  specified  when  changing  the  user's authentication  type  to  remote

Kerberos authentication.

This option is only valid when the -t option is specified to change the user's authentication type to remote Kerberos authentication.

You can either use this option, or use the remote\_user\_name attribute with the -f or -i option, to change the remote user ID. The --remoteuser , -f , and -i options are mutually exclusive.

## --localpasswd

The password for this user. The password must be at least 8 and maximum 32 characters in length.

This option is only valid when the -t option is specified to change the user's authentication type to local authentication.

You can either use this option, or use the passwd attribute with the -f or -i option, to specify the password for this user when changing the user's authentication type to local authentication. If this option is omitted or the -f or -i option is specified and the passwd attribute is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The --localpasswd , -f , and -i options are mutually exclusive.

## DESCRIPTION

chhwres changes the hardware resource configuration of the managed-system . chhwres is used to perform dynamic logical partitioning (DLPAR) operations.

When chhwres is used to add a virtual I/O adapter to a Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partition, chhwres issues the VIOS cfgdev command to configure the device in the VIOS. When chhwres is used to remove a virtual I/O adapter from a VIOS partition, chhwres issues the VIOS rmdev command to remove the device from the VIOS partition.

When chhwres is used to remove memory or processing resources from a shutdown partition, if the amount of memory or processing resources falls below the minimum for the partition, the minimum, assigned, and maximum values for the partition are all set to 0. Also, if the memory values for a partition are set to 0, the

processing resource values for the partition will also be set to 0. Likewise, if the processing resource values for a partition are set to 0, the memory values for the partition will also be set to 0.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of hardware resources to change. Valid values are io for physical I/O, virtualio for virtual I/O, mem for memory, mempool for shared memory pool, rspool for reserved storage device pool, pmem for persistent memory, proc for processing, procpool for shared processor pool, sriov for Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), and accel for hardware accelerator resources.

Reserved storage device pool operations are only supported on managed systems that support partition suspend and resume operations.

## --rsubtype

The subtype of hardware resources to change. Valid physical I/O resource subtypes are slot for I/O slots, bus for I/O buses, iopool for I/O pools, and taggedio for tagged I/O resources. Valid virtual I/O resource subtypes are eth for virtual ethernet, fc for virtual fibre channel, scsi for virtual SCSI, serial for virtual serial, virtualopti for virtual OptiConnect, vnetwork for virtual network, vnic for  virtual  NIC, vnicbkdev for  virtual  NIC  backing  device,  and vswitch for  virtual switch  resources. Valid  SR-IOV resource  subtypes  are adapter for  SR-IOV adapter  resources, logport for  SR-IOV logical  port  resources,  and physport for  SR-IOV physical  port  resources. Valid persistent memory resource subtypes are volume for persistent memory volume resources. Valid hardware accelerator resource subtypes are gzip for GZIP hardware accelerator resources.

The only valid shared memory pool resource subtype is pgdev for paging space devices.  The only valid reserved storage device pool resource subtype is rsdev for reserved storage devices.  On a managed system that supports Active Memory Sharing and partition suspend and resume operations,  the  command chhwres -m managed-system -r  mempool --rsubtype pgdev -o { a | r } -p VIOS-partition-name --device device-name adds  or  removes a device  in  the  reserved  storage device pool, and is equivalent to the command chhwres -m managed-system -r rspool --rsubtype rsdev -o { a | r } -p VIOS-partition-name --device device-name .

This option is required for physical I/O and virtual I/O set operations, for virtual I/O add operations, and for virtual network, virtual switch, SR-IOV,  persistent memory, and hardware accelerator  operations. This option is not valid for memory, processor, or shared processor pool operations.

- -m The name of the managed system for which the hardware resource configuration is to be changed. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are a to  add  hardware resources, r to  remove  hardware resources, m to move hardware resources from one partition to another, s to set hardware resources or  attributes, d to  disable  a  virtual  ethernet  adapter, virtual  NIC,  or  SR-IOV logical  port, e to enable a virtual ethernet adapter, virtual NIC, or SR-IOV logical port, rs to reset I/O entitled memory  statistics  for  a  partition  or  to  reset  statistics  for  an  SR-IOV logical  or  physical  port, so to switch over a running shared memory partition to its redundant paging VIOS partition or to switch over all virtual NIC backing devices on the managed system from the specified VIOS partition to other VIOS partitions, sync to synchronize the virtual switch mode, c to clear a physical I/O slot or  bus,  or  clear  a  virtual  NIC  backing  device  error, act to  make a virtual  NIC  backing  device active, or rc to recover a migratable SR-IOV logical port.

The c operation is useful for clearing stale physical I/O slot or bus information after a physical I/O adapter or drawer has been concurrently removed but not replaced.

- -p The name of the partition for which to perform the operation. For a move operation, this is the source partition (the partition the resources will be moved from) for the operation.

When adding or removing a device in the shared memory pool or the reserved storage device pool, use this option to specify the name of the VIOS partition which has the device.  If the device is accessed by more than one VIOS partition, then only one of the VIOS partitions must be specified, and the device name specified with the --device option must be the name of the device on that VIOS partition.

## --entitled

The quantity of I/O entitled memory to add, remove, or set.  The quantity specified  must  be  in megabytes, or quantity can be auto . If quantity is a number, then automatic I/O entitled memory management will no longer be provided for the partition after the quantity of I/O entitled memory is added, removed, or set. If quantity is auto , then the partition will be set to have automatic I/O entitled memory management, and if necessary, I/O entitled memory will be added or removed at this  time  so  that  the  partition  has  the  amount  of  memory  required  with  automatic  I/O  entitled memory management.

When adding I/O entitled memory to a partition or removing I/O entitled memory from a partition, you can either specify an add or remove operation and specify the amount of I/O entitled memory you want to add or remove, or you can specify a set operation and specify the total amount of I/O entitled memory you want the partition to have when the operation completes.

This option also allows you to force an add, remove, move, or memory, processor, or hardware accelerator set operation to be performed for an AIX, Linux, or VIOS partition that does not have an RMC connection to the HMC. This option also allows you to force a migratable SR-IOV logical  port  recover operation to be performed for an AIX or Linux partition that does not have an RMC connection to the HMC. If this command completes successfully, you will need to restart your operating system for the change to take affect.  You should only use this option if you intentionally configured your LAN to isolate the HMC from the operating system of your partition.

This option also allows you to force the additional VLAN IDs for a virtual ethernet adapter to be changed for a VIOS partition that does not have an RMC connection to the HMC.

This option also allows you to force a virtual switch to be set to VEPA mode when the physical switch does not support the IEEE 802.1Qbg standard.

## --allownetdisrupt

This option must be specified when adding one or more backing devices to a virtual NIC that currently has only one backing device and its MAC address is the same as the virtual NIC's MAC address. The HMC will remove the existing backing device and recreate it with a different MAC address after adding the specified backing devices. The recreate will cause a short network disruption for the virtual NIC.

- -a The configuration data for the command. The configuration data consists of attribute name/value pairs,  which  are  in  comma  separated  value  (CSV)  format. The  configuration  data  must  be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the configuration data is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

If ' += ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', then the specified value is added to the existing value for the attribute if the attribute is numerical. If  the attribute is a list, then the specified value (s) is added to the existing list.

If ' -= ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', then the specified value is subtracted from the existing value for the attribute if the attribute is numerical. If the attribute is a list, then the specified value (s) is deleted from the existing list.

## NAME

chipsec - change IPsec configuration

## SYNOPSIS

```
To create and start an IPsec connection to a managed system: chipsec -m managed-system --left IPv6-address --passkey passphrase To create and start a user-defined IPsec connection: chipsec -f connection-file --passkey passphrase [ --cert certificate-file ] To start, stop, or remove an IPsec connection: chipsec { --up connection-name | --down connection-name | -r connection-name }
```

```
To start or stop the IPsec service on the Hardware Management Console: chipsec { --start | --stop }
```

## DESCRIPTION

chipsec changes the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) configuration on the Hardware Management Console (HMC). It can also be used to manage IPsec connections and the IPsec service.

An IPsec connection is automatically started when it is created. The IPsec service is automatically started when the first IPsec connection is created.

The HMC uses the strongSwan IPsec implementation.

## OPTIONS

-m

The name of the managed system to which to create an IPsec connection. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.

- --left The HMC IPv6 address to be used for the IPsec connection to the managed-system .

## --passkey

The passphrase.

- -f The name of the file that contains the configuration information for the user-defined IPsec connection  to  be  created. The  configuration  information  in  the  file  must  be  the conn section  for  the ipsec.conf file.  The file can contain the configuration information for one connection only.

If the file is on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

- --cert The name of the file that contains the certificate for the user-defined IPsec connection to be created.  The file name must end with the .pem suffix.

If the file is on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

- --up Specify this option to start the IPsec connection connection-name . If the IPsec service is not running, it will be started.

An IPsec connection is automatically started when it is created.

- --down Specify this option to stop the IPsec connection connection-name . If no other IPsec connections are active, the IPsec service will be stopped.
- -r Specify this option to remove the IPsec connection connection-name .

An active IPsec connection is stopped before it is removed.

- --start Specify this option to start the IPsec service on the HMC.

The IPsec service is automatically started when the first IPsec connection is created or started.

- --stop Specify this option to stop the IPsec service on the HMC.

The IPsec service is automatically stopped when the last IPsec connection is removed or stopped.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Create and start an IPsec connection to managed system j21 :

## chipsec -m j21 --left fe80:0:0:0:221:5eff:fe46:57ce

- --passkey hmctest1234!

Create and start a user-defined IPsec connection:

## chipsec -f connfile.txt --passkey passphrase1

Create and start a user-defined IPsec connection with certificate. Both files are on a USB flash memory device (the USB flash memory device must already be connected to the HMC):

lsmediadev (to obtain mount points)

mount /media/sdb1

chipsec -f /media/sdb1/user\_file.txt --cert /media/sdb1/user\_cert.pem --passkey hmctest1234!

Start the IPsec connection j21 :

chipsec --up j21

Stop the IPsec connection j21 :

## chipsec --down j21

Remove the IPsec connection j21 :

chipsec -r j21

Start the IPsec service on the HMC:

## chipsec --start

```

## DESCRIPTION

chlparstate changes the state of a partition on the managed-system .

chlparstate is  used  to  perform  partition  suspend  and  resume  operations. Partition  suspend  and  resume operations can be performed for AIX, Linux, and IBM i partitions.

See the chsysstate command for additional partition state change operations.

chlparstate can also be used to perform partition shutdown operations. Either chlparstate or chsysstate can be used to shut down a partition that is not suspended.

The recommended procedure for shutting down a suspended partition is to resume the partition first, then shut it down.  However, if you want to shut down a partition while it is suspended, then it is recommended that chlparstate , not chsysstate , be used to shut down the partition because chlparstate supports additional options that chsysstate does not.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are suspend to validate then suspend a partition if validation succeeds, resume to validate then resume a suspended partition if validation succeeds, validate to  validate  a  partition  suspend  or  resume  operation, cancel to  stop  a  partition  suspend  or resume  operation, recover to  recover from  a  failed  partition  suspend  or  resume  operation,  and shutdown to shut down a partition.
- -t To validate, cancel, or recover a partition suspend operation, specify suspend with this option.

To validate, cancel, or recover a partition resume operation, specify resume with this option.

- -m The name of the managed system on which to perform the partition state change operation. The name  may  either  be  the  user-defined  name  for  the  managed  system,  or  be  in  the  form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -p The name of the partition for which to perform the operation.

You must either use this option to specify the name of the partition, or use the --id option to specify the partition's ID.  The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the partition for which to perform the operation.

You must either use this option to specify the ID of the partition, or use the -p option to specify the partition's name.  The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

- -f The name of the file containing the input data for this command. The data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The format of the data is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...

Valid attribute names for this command:

primary\_rs\_vios\_name | primary\_rs\_vios\_id secondary\_rs\_vios\_name | secondary\_rs\_vios\_id primary\_vios\_name | primary\_vios\_id These attributes are deprecated. Use the primary\_rs\_vios\_name | primary\_rs\_vios\_id attributes instead. secondary\_vios\_name | secondary\_vios\_id These attributes are deprecated. Use the secondary\_rs\_vios\_name | secondary\_rs\_vios\_id attributes instead.

Input data for this command can be specified with this option or the -i option.  The -f and the -i options are mutually exclusive.

Input data can be specified when suspending a partition or validating a partition suspend operation only.

- -i This  option  allows  you  to  enter  input  data  on  the  command  line,  instead  of  using  a  file.  Data entered on the command line must follow the same format as data in a file, and must be enclosed in double quotes.

Input data for this command can be specified with this option or the -f option.  The -i and the -f options are mutually exclusive.

Input data can be specified when suspending a partition or validating a partition suspend operation only.

## --protectstorage

When suspending a partition or validating a partition suspend operation, use this option to specify whether the partition's virtual storage devices are required to be protected to prevent accidental reassignment of the devices while the partition is suspended. To  protect a suspended partition's virtual storage devices, all Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partitions hosting the devices must be capable  of  reporting  virtual  storage  device  usage  of  suspended  partitions  (VIOS  version  2.2.1.4  or later).

Valid values for this option are 1 if the partition's virtual storage devices are required to be protected  while  the  partition  is  suspended,  or 2 if  the  partition's virtual  storage  devices  are  not required to be protected while the partition is suspended, but should be protected if possible. If this option is not specified, this option defaults to the value 1 .

If this option has a value of 1 and not all of the VIOS partitions hosting the partition's virtual storage devices are capable of reporting virtual storage device usage of suspended partitions, an error will occur and the operation will fail since not all of the partition's virtual storage devices can be protected.  The operation can succeed if this option has a value of 2 , but you would be responsible for ensuring the integrity of the partition's virtual storage devices while the partition is suspended.

This option is valid when suspending a partition or validating a partition suspend operation only.

- --mpio When resuming a partition, validating a partition resume operation, or shutting down a suspended partition, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain an equivalent  multipath  I/O  (MPIO)  configuration  of  the  partition's virtual  SCSI  and  virtual  fibre channel adapters. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain an equivalent MPIO configuration, or 2 if  the management console is not required to maintain an equivalent MPIO configuration, but should do so if possible. If  this  option  is  not  specified,  then  this option defaults to the value 1 .

If  this  option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot guarantee that an equivalent MPIO configuration of all of the partition's virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapters can be maintained, then an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is valid when resuming a partition, validating a partition resume operation, or shutting down a suspended partition only.

## --vlanbridge

When resuming a partition, validating a partition resume operation, or shutting down a suspended partition,  use  this  option  to  specify  whether  each  of  the  partition's virtual  ethernet  adapters  is required to be configured so that it is bridged on the same VLAN to an external network.  Valid values are 1 if the partition's virtual ethernet adapters are required to be bridged, or 2 if the partition's virtual ethernet adapters are not required to be bridged, but should be bridged if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If this option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot guarantee that all of the partition's virtual ethernet adapters can be bridged, then an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is valid when resuming a partition, validating a partition resume operation, or shutting down a suspended partition only.

- --vsi When resuming a partition or validating a partition resume operation, use this option to specify whether the partition's virtual ethernet adapter Virtual Station Interface (VSI) profiles are required to be configured. Valid values are 1 if VSI profiles are required to be configured, or 2 if VSI profiles are not required to be configured, but should be configured if possible. If this option is not

## --restart

specified, then this option defaults to the value of the --vlanbridge option.

If this option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot configure all of the partition's VSI profiles, an error will occur and the operation will fail.

A value of 1 cannot be specified with this option when a value of 2 is specified with the --vlanbridge option.

This option is valid when resuming a partition or validating a partition resume operation only.

- -w The maximum time, in minutes, to wait for operating system commands issued by the management console during the partition state change operation to complete. If an operating system command does  not  complete  within  the  time  specified,  the  partition  state  change  operation  will  be stopped.

wait-time must be a whole number. If wait-time is 0, the partition state change operation will not be timed out.

If this option is not specified, a default value of 3 minutes is used.

- -d The level of detail requested from operating system commands issued by the management console during the partition state change operation. Valid values are 1 (lowest) through 5 (highest).

If this option is not specified, a default value of 1 is used.

- -v Specify this option to enable verbose mode for the partition state change operation. When verbose mode is enabled, detail messages and warning messages are displayed for a successful partition state change operation. Detail messages and warning messages are always displayed for a partition state change operation that fails, regardless of whether this option is specified.

When the --nodetails option is also specified, no detail messages are displayed.

This option can be specified for a partition suspend, resume, or recover operation.  This option can also be specified when shutting down a suspended partition.

## --nodetails

Specify this option to suppress the display of all detail messages.

## --immed

Specify this option on a partition shutdown or restart operation to perform an immediate shutdown or restart.

If  this  option is specified, but the --restart option is not, then an immediate shutdown (operator panel function 8) is performed. If  both  the --immed and the --restart options are specified, an immediate  restart  (operator  panel  function  3)  is  performed. If  neither  the --immed nor  the --restart option is specified, a delayed shutdown is performed.

When shutting down a suspended partition, this option is ignored.

Specify this option on a partition shutdown operation to restart the partition.

If this option is specified, but the --immed option is not, a dump restart operation (operator panel function 22) is performed. If both the --immed and the --restart options are specified, an immediate restart (operator panel function 3) is performed.

This option is not valid when shutting down a suspended partition.

--force When performing a recover operation, use this option to force the recover operation to proceed when errors are encountered.

When performing a shutdown operation for a suspended partition, use this option to immediately power off the partition without restoring the configuration of its virtual I/O. You will not be able to restart the partition without manually restoring the virtual I/O configuration.

You can also use this option to force a migrating partition to be shut down.  Use this option carefully as manual intervention may be required to recover the failed migration after the partition is shut down.

Display the help text for this command and exit.

## NAME

chlparutil - change utilization data collection settings

## SYNOPSIS

chlparutil -r config [ -m managed-system ] -s sample-rate [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

chlparutil changes the Hardware Management Console (HMC) settings for utilization data collection for managed systems.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of utilization data collection resources to change. The only valid value is config for configuration settings.
- -m The name of the managed system for which the settings for utilization data collection are to be changed.  The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * ssssssss , where tttt is  the  machine  type, mmm is  the  model,  and ssssssss is  the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * ssssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name, or if the HMC does not currently have a connection to the managed system.

If this option is not specified, then the HMC settings for utilization data collection for all of the systems currently managed by this HMC, and for all of the systems for which utilization data has been previously collected by this HMC will be changed. Even though utilization data collection is enabled for a managed system, the HMC will only collect utilization data for that managed system if the HMC currently has a connection to that managed system.

This command only changes the settings for utilization data collection for this HMC. Utilization data collection by other HMCs for the same managed systems is not affected.

- -s The rate, in seconds, at which to sample the utilization data. Sample rates of 0 , 30 (30 seconds), 60 (60 seconds), 300 (5 minutes), 1800 (30 minutes), and 3600 (1 hour) are supported. A sample rate of 0 disables utilization data collection.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Enable the collection of utilization data with a sample rate of 1 hour for all managed systems:

## chlparutil -r config -s 3600

Enable the collection of utilization data with a sample rate of 60 seconds for the managed system mySystem :

## chlparutil -r config -s 60 -m mySystem

Disable the collection of utilization data for the managed system with the type, model, and serial number 9406-520*98765432 :

## NAME

chnportlogin - N\_Port log in and log out

## SYNOPSIS

chnportlogin -o { login | logout } -m managed-system

{ [

-p partition-name | --id partition-ID } [ -n profile-name ]

-w wait-time ] [ -d detail-level ] [ -v ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

chnportlogin performs N\_Port login and logout operations for virtual Fibre Channel client adapters that are configured in a partition or a partition profile.

When performing a login operation, all inactive WWPNs will be activated, including the second WWPN in the  pair  assigned  to  each  virtual  Fibre  Channel  client  adapter. When performing a logout operation, all WWPNs not in use will be deactivated.

To successfully log in a virtual Fibre Channel client adapter, the corresponding virtual Fibre Channel server adapter must exist and it must be mapped.

The primary intent of the login operation is to allow the system administrator to allocate, log in and zone WWPNs before the client partition is activated.  With best practices, the WWPNs should be logged out after they are zoned on the Storage Area Network (SAN) and before the partition is activated.  If a partition is activated with WWPNs still logged in, the WWPNs used for client access are automatically logged out so they can be logged in by the client.

The login operation can also be used to zone the inactive WWPNs in preparation for a partition mobility operation.  If the login operation is performed when a partition is already active, only the inactive WWPNs are activated to the "constant login" state similar to physical Fibre Channel adapters. The WWPNs that are already in use by the virtual Fibre Channel client adapters remain in control of the virtual Fibre Channel clients and are not under the control of this command. This means that active client virtual Fibre Channel WWPNs do not achieve a "constant login" state similar to physical Fibre Channel adapters.

The login operation can interfere with partition mobility operations. Best practice is to perform a logout operation for a partition before attempting to migrate the partition to another server. If a mobility operation is attempted with WWPNs still logged in, the firmware will attempt to automatically log out the WWPNs. However, in some cases, the logouts may not complete in time and may therefore cause the mobility operation to fail.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid  values  are login to  log  in  the  WWPNs  assigned  to  the  virtual Fibre Channel client adapters, or logout to log out the WWPNs assigned to the virtual Fibre Channel adapters.
- -m The name of the managed system on which to perform the operation. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * ssssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and ssssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * ssssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.
- -p The name of the partition for which to perform the operation.

You must either use this option to specify the name of the partition, or use the --id option to specify the partition's ID.  The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the partition for which to perform the operation.

You must either use this option to specify the ID of the partition, or use the -p option to specify the partition's name.  The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

- -n The name of the partition profile for which to perform the operation. The operation will be performed for all of the virtual Fibre Channel client adapters configured in the partition profile. If this option is not specified, then the operation will be performed for all of the virtual Fibre Channel client adapters in the current configuration of the partition.
- -w The maximum time, in minutes, to wait for each Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) command issued by the HMC to complete. If a VIOS command does not complete within the time specified, the login or logout operation for the virtual Fibre Channel client adapter will be stopped.

wait-time must be a whole number. If wait-time is 0, the operation will not be timed out.

If this option is not specified, a default value of 3 minutes is used.

- -d The level of detail requested from VIOS commands issued by the HMC. Valid values are 0 (none) through 5 (highest).

If this option is not specified, a default value of 1 is used.

- -v Specify this option to enable verbose mode. When verbose mode is enabled and this command succeeds, all warning messages are displayed. When this command partially succeeds or fails, all warning and error messages are displayed regardless of whether this option is specified.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXIT STATUS

This command has the following return codes:

- 0 Success
- 100 Partial success

Any other value means the command failed.

## EXAMPLES

Log in all of the inactive WWPNs assigned to the virtual Fibre Channel client adapters in a partition's current configuration:

## chnportlogin -m 9117-MMB*1234567 -o login -p clientPartition

Log in all of the WWPNs assigned to the virtual Fibre Channel client adapters in a partition profile:

chpwrmgmt - change power management settings

## SYNOPSIS

```
To enable or disable power saver mode: chpwrmgmt -m managed-system -r sys -o { enable | disable } [ -t { static | dynamic_favor_perf | dynamic_favor_power | fixed_max_frequency | balanced_perf | dynamic_perf | max_perf | power_saving | idle }] [ --help ] To set or reset dynamic or idle power saver parameters: ]
```

```
chpwrmgmt -m managed-system -r sys -o { set | reset } -t { dynamic_parms | idle_parms } [ -a " attributes " [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

chpwrmgmt configures the power management settings for the managed-system .

## OPTIONS

- -m The name of the managed system for which to configure power management settings. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -r The type of resource for which to configure power management settings. The only valid value is sys for managed system.
- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are enable to enable power saver mode, disable to disable power saver mode, set to set dynamic or idle power saver parameters, and reset to reset dynamic or idle power saver parameters to their default values.

Power saver mode cannot be disabled on Power10 servers.

Warning: enabling any of the power saver modes will cause changes in processor frequencies, changes in processor utilization, and changes in power consumption, which can cause performance of the managed system to vary.

Warning: changing dynamic or idle power saver parameters can result in unexpected behavior and performance impacts. It is recommended that you consult your system provider before changing dynamic or idle power saver parameters.

- -t The type of power saver mode to enable or the type of power saver parameters to set or reset. Valid  power  saver mode types are static for  static  power  saver mode (POWER8 and POWER9 servers only) or fixed base frequency (Power10 servers only), dynamic\_favor\_perf for dynamic power  saver mode  favoring  performance  (POWER8  servers  only), dynamic\_favor\_power for dynamic power saver mode favoring power (POWER8 servers only), fixed\_max\_frequency for fixed  maximum  frequency power  saver mode  (POWER8  servers  only), balanced\_perf for dynamic performance power saver mode (Power10 servers only), dynamic\_perf for dynamic performance  power  saver mode  (POWER9  servers  only), max\_perf for  maximum  performance power saver mode (POWER9 and Power10 servers only), power\_saving for  static  power  saver mode (Power10 servers only), and idle for idle power saver mode.  Valid power saver parameter types are dynamic\_parms for dynamic power saver tuning parameters and idle\_parms for idle power saver parameters.

When enabling power saver mode, if this option is not specified it defaults to static . With the exception of idle power saver mode, only one power saver mode can be enabled at a time. Idle

power saver mode can be enabled independently of all other modes.

You can use the lspwrmgmt -m managed-system -r sys -F supported\_power\_saver\_mode\_types command to display the power saver modes that are supported on the managed-system . Note that idle will not appear in this list. If idle power saver mode is not supported on the managed-system , the lspwrmgmt -m managed-system -r  sys  -F  idle\_power\_saver\_mode command will display unavailable .

To disable idle power saver mode, you must specify idle with this option. Otherwise, this option is not allowed when disabling power saver mode, as the current power saver mode will be disabled.

- -a The power saver parameters to set. The data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The format of the attribute data is as follows:

```
attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...
```

The  valid  attribute  names  for  setting  dynamic  power  saver tuning  parameters  are  listed  below. Issue the lspwrmgmt -m managed-system -r sys -t dynamic\_parms command to display the minimum and maximum values allowed for each parameter. Dynamic power saver tuning parameters are not supported for Enterprise Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) based managed systems.

```
util_thresh_incr_freq percentage with up to 1 decimal place util_thresh_decr_freq percentage with up to 1 decimal place num_samples_util_stats integer freq_step_up_size percentage with up to 1 decimal place freq_step_down_size percentage with up to 1 decimal place active_cores_delta percentage active_slack_cores_util_thresh percentage with up to 1 decimal place core_freq_delta_state Valid values: 0 - disable 1 - enable core_max_freq_delta percentage
```

The valid attribute names for setting idle power saver parameters are listed below.  Issue the lspwrmgmt -m managed-system -r sys -t idle\_parms command to display the minimum and maximum values allowed for each parameter. For Enterprise BMC-based managed systems, the minimum and maximum values are documented below.

chsvc -s cloudconn -o { start | stop | restart } [ -k key ] [ --http proxy-URI ] [ --socks proxy-URI ] [ --auth { kerberos | ldap | digest-md5 | basic }] [ --addcert ] [ --purge ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

chsvc changes the configuration of a service, such as SNMP or cloud connector, on the Hardware Managment Console (HMC).

## OPTIONS

- -s The service for which to change the configuration. Valid values are snmp for  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version 3, and cloudconn for the cloud connector.
- -o The operation to perform.

Specify start to  start  monitoring  managed  systems  on  the  HMC  using  SNMP. If the  SNMPv3 agent is not already running on the HMC, it will be started. In addition, Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) statistics collection for the managed systems will be enabled, and the sample rate will be set to 1 minute. The chstat command can be used to change the sample rate.

Specify start to start the cloud connector on the HMC.

Specify stop to stop monitoring managed systems on the HMC using SNMP. Also, VLAN statistics  collection  for  the  managed systems will be disabled. In addition, if there are no remaining managed systems on the HMC that are being monitored, the SNMPv3 agent on the HMC will be stopped.

Specify stop to stop the cloud connector on the HMC.

Specify add to add a network management system to the SNMP trap notification list.

Specify remove to remove a network management system from the SNMP trap notification list.

Specify restart to stop then start the cloud connector on the HMC.

- -m The name of the managed system to start or stop being monitored by the SNMPv3 agent on the HMC.  The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

If this option is not specified for a start operation, then a maximum of five of the systems currently managed by the HMC will be monitored. If this option is not specified for a stop operation, then monitoring for all managed systems will be stopped.

- --ip The IP address or host name of the network management system to add to or remove from the SNMP trap notification list.
- --traps A list of traps to send to the network management system. If  multiple  traps  are  specified,  they must be comma separated.

For a list of all of the traps supported by the SNMPv3 agent on the HMC, run the lssvc -s snmp -r trapnames command.

This option is required when adding a network management system to the SNMP trap notification list.  This option is not valid otherwise.

- -k The cloud connector key. This key is obtained from the Cloud Management Console Portal settings page under the Cloud Connector tab.

This option is required when starting or restarting the cloud connector. This option is not valid otherwise.

- --http The  HTTP  proxy  URI.  This  URI  must  be  specified  in  the  format  [ user-ID : [ password ] @ ] hostname [ : port ].  If password is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.  If port is omitted,  it  will  default  to 3128 . host-name can either  be  the  host  name  or  IP  address  of  the  HTTP proxy server.

This option is only valid when starting or restarting the cloud connector.

- --socks The SOCKS proxy URI. This URI must be specified in the format [ user-ID : [ password ] @ ] hostname [ : port ].  If password is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.  If port is omitted, it will default to 1080 . host-name can either be the host name or IP address of the SOCKS proxy server.

This option is only valid when starting or restarting the cloud connector.

- --auth The user authentication type for the proxy connection. Valid values are kerberos for remote Kerberos authentication, ldap for remote LDAP authentication, digest-md5 for digest authentication, and basic for basic authentication.

If  this  option  is  omitted  when  starting  or  restarting  the  cloud  connector  with  a  proxy, the  user authentication type defaults to basic .

This option is only valid when starting or restarting the cloud connector with a proxy.

## --addcert

The cloud connector must connect to cloud endpoints to start successfully. These endpoints are specified on the Cloud Management Console Portal settings page under the Cloud Connector tab. If the cloud connector encounters a non-trusted certificate chain in this communication path due to a proxy or a company's network firewall settings, these non-trusted certificates must be added to the HMC's truststore to enable communication between the cloud connector and the cloud endpoints. Specifying this --addcert option  will  automatically  add  the  required  certificates  to  the HMC's truststore.  Alternatively the user can run the chhmccert command to add the required certificates to the HMC's truststore prior to starting or restarting the cloud connector.

This option is only valid when starting or restarting the cloud connector.

Specify this option to purge all data associated with this HMC in the cloud when the cloud connector is stopped.

This option is only valid when stopping the cloud connector.

## --purge

chsyscfg - change system resources

```
NAME SYNOPSIS
```

```
To change attributes: chsyscfg -r { lpar | prof | sys | sysprof } -m managed-system { -f configuration-file | -i " configuration-data " } [ --force ] [ --help ] To change partition attributes by applying a partition profile: }
```

```
chsyscfg -r lpar -m managed-system -o apply { -p partition-name | --id partition-ID [ -n profile-name ] [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

chsyscfg changes the attributes of partitions, partition profiles, or system profiles for the managed-system . It can also change the attributes of the managed-system .

## USAGE IN A POWERVM MANAGEMENT CONTROLLER MODE ENVIRONMENT

When the managed-system is in PowerVM management controller mode, both the chsyscfg -r lpar and the chsyscfg -r prof commands may be used to change the current configuration of a partition. The following attributes are not allowed with the chsyscfg -r lpar command: profile\_name and sync\_curr\_profile . The following attributes are not allowed with the chsyscfg -r prof command: name and new\_name . The partition will be configured immediately with the specified attributes.

When running chsyscfg -r lpar -o apply the -n option is not allowed. The last valid configuration partition profile will always be applied.

The Hardware Management Console (HMC) must be the current PowerVM management controller for the managed-system when running the chsyscfg -r lpar and chsyscfg -r prof commands.

The chsyscfg -r sysprof command is not allowed.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of resources to change. Valid values are lpar for partitions, prof for partition profiles, sys for the managed system, and sysprof for system profiles.
- -m The name of either the managed system to be changed, or the managed system which has the system resources to be changed. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is  the machine type, mmm is  the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -f The name of the file containing the configuration data needed to change the resources. The configuration data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  These attribute name/value pairs form a configuration record. A line feed marks the end of a configuration  record. The  file  must  contain  one  configuration  record  for  each  resource  to  be changed, and each configuration record must be for the same resource type. If the resource type is the managed system, then the file must contain only one configuration record.

The format of a configuration record is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...&lt;LF&gt;

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...&lt;LF&gt;

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

If ' += ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', then the specified value is added to the existing value for the attribute if the attribute is numerical. If  the attribute is a list, then the specified value (s) is added to the existing list.

If ' -= ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', then the specified value is subtracted from the existing value for the attribute if the attribute is numerical. If the attribute is a list, then the specified value (s) is deleted from the existing list.

Attribute names for partitions:

name | lpar\_id name or ID of the partition to change (required) new\_name default\_profile ipl\_source IBM i only Valid values are a , b , c , or d allow\_perf\_collection Valid values are: 0 - do not allow 1 - allow This attribute replaces the shared\_proc\_pool\_util\_auth attribute.

## virtual\_eth\_adapters

Comma separated list of virtual ethernet adapters, with each adapter having the following format:

virtual-slot-number / is-IEEE / port-vlan-ID / [ additional-vlan-IDs ] / [ trunk-priority ] / is-required [ / [ virtual-switch ][ / [ MAC-address ] / [ allowed-OS-MAC-addresses ] / [ QoS-priority

]]]

The first 5 ' / ' characters must be present. The 6th ' / ' character is optional, but it must be present if virtual-switch or any of the values following

virtual-switch are specified. The last 3 ' / ' characters are optional, but all 3 must be present if MAC-address , allowed-OS-MAC-addresses , or QoS-priority is specified.

Optional values may be omitted. Optional values are additional-vlan-IDs , trunk-priority , virtual-switch , MAC-address , allowed-OS-MAC-addresses , and QoS-priority .

Valid values for is-IEEE and is-required :

0 - no

1 - yes

If values are specified for additional-vlan-IDs , they must be comma separated.

Valid values for trunk-priority :

- 0 - this adapter is not a trunk adapter (default value)
- 1 -15 - this adapter is a trunk adapter with the specified priority

If MAC-address is not specified, a unique MAC address will be automatically generated for the adapter. If it is specified, it must be specified as 12 hexadecimal characters. It is highly recommended that you do not specify MAC-address so that the MAC address will be automatically generated.

allowed-OS-MAC-addresses can be a comma separated list of 1 to 4 MAC addresses, where each MAC address is specified as 12 hexadecimal characters, or it can be one of the following values:

all - all OS defined MAC addresses are allowed (default value)

none - no OS defined MAC addresses are allowed

Valid values for QoS-priority :

none - do not use Quality of Service (QoS) (default value)

- 0 -7 - the QoS priority level to use

For example:

## 13/1/5/6,7/2/1

specifies a virtual ethernet adapter with a virtual slot number of 13 , it is IEEE 802.1Q compatible, it has a port virtual LAN ID of 5 , additional virtual LAN IDs of 6 and 7 , it is a trunk adapter with a trunk priority of 2 , and it is required. It also uses the default virtual switch, it uses an automatically generated MAC address, it allows all OS defined MAC addresses, and it does not use QoS.

## 4/1/3//0/1///fecd537a910b,fecd537a910c/2

specifies a virtual ethernet adapter with a virtual slot number of 4 , it is IEEE 802.1Q compatible, it has a port virtual LAN ID of 3 , no additional virtual LAN IDs, it is not a trunk adapter, it is required, it uses the default virtual switch, it uses an automatically generated MAC address, it allows the OS defined MAC addresses FE:CD:53:7A:91:0B and FE:CD:53:7A:91:0C, and it uses a QoS priority level of 2 .

## virtual\_eth\_vsi\_profiles

Comma separated list of virtual ethernet adapter Virtual Station Interface (VSI) profile attributes:

virtual-slot-number / VSI-manager-ID / VSI-type-ID / VSI-type-version

All 3 ' / ' characters must be present, and all values are required.

For example:

## 15/2/1193040/1

specifies a VSI profile for the virtual ethernet adapter in slot 15 . The VSI profile has a VSI manager ID of 2 , a VSI type ID of 1193040 , and a VSI type version of 1 .

## virtual\_fc\_adapters

Comma separated list of virtual fibre channel adapters, with each adapter having the following format:

virtual-slot-number / client-or-server / [ remote-lpar-ID ] / [ remote-lpar-name ] / remote-slot-number / [ wwpns ] / is-required

All 6 ' / ' characters must be present, but optional values may be omitted. Optional values are remote-lpar-ID or remote-lpar-name (one of those values is required, but not both).

wwpns is optional for a client adapter, and is not allowed for a server adapter. If wwpns is not specified, WWPNs will be automatically generated for a client adapter. It is highly recommended that you do not specify wwpns so that WWPNs will be automatically generated, unless you are changing an existing virtual fibre channel adapter and you want to retain its existing WWPNs. If you do specify wwpns , you must specify exactly two WWPNs, and they must be comma separated.

Valid values for client-or-server : client server

## port\_vlan\_id

Port VLAN ID or 0 to disable VLAN tag insertions for untagged frames (default value)

## pvid\_priority

Valid values:

An integer between 0 and 7 , inclusive.

Default value is 0 .

## allowed\_vlan\_ids

Comma separated list of VLAN IDs, or one of the following values:

all - all VLAN IDs are allowed (default value) none - no VLAN IDs are allowed

## mac\_addr

12 hexadecimal characters If not specified, a unique MAC address will be automatically generated for the virtual NIC. It is highly recommended that you use an automatically generated MAC address.

## allowed\_os\_mac\_addrs

Comma separated list of MAC addresses, each specified as 12 hexadecimal characters. Other valid values:

all - all OS defined MAC addresses are allowed (default value)

none - no OS defined MAC addresses are allowed

## is\_required

Valid values:

0 - no

1 - yes (default value)

## auto\_priority\_failover

Valid values:

0 - automatic priority failover is disabled

1 - automatic priority failover is enabled (default value)

## backing\_devices

Required

Comma separated list of virtual NIC backing devices, with each backing device having the following format:

sriov/ vios-lpar-name / vios-lpar-ID / sriov-adapter-ID / sriov-physical-port-ID / [ capacity ][ / [ failover-priority ][ / [ max-capacity ]]]

The first 5 ' / ' characters must be present. The 6th ' / ' character is optional, but it must be present if failover-priority or max-capacity is specified. The 7th ' / ' character is optional, but it must be present if max-capacity is specified.

Optional values may be omitted. Optional values are capacity , either vios-lpar-name or vios-lpar-ID , failover-priority , and max-capacity .

Specify capacity and max-capacity each as a percentage with up to 2 decimal places. max-capacity defaults to 100 if not specified.

Specify failover-priority as a value between 1 and 100 inclusive, with 1 being the highest priority. It defaults to 50 if not specified.

## For example:

slot\_num=5:backing\_devices=sriov/vios1//1/0//1, sriov/vios2//2/0//10/50 specifies a virtual NIC with a virtual slot number of 5 and 2 backing devices. The first backing device is on VIOS vios1 and physical port 0 of SR-IOV adapter 1 and has a failover priority of 1 . The second backing device is on VIOS vios2 and physical port 0 of SR-IOV adapter 2 and has a failover priority of 10 and a maximum capacity of 50 %.  All the other virtual NIC properties are configured with default values.

## work\_group\_id

```

## DESCRIPTION

chsysstate changes the state of a partition or the managed-system .

See the chlparstate command for additional partition state change operations.

## USAGE IN A POWERVM MANAGEMENT CONTROLLER MODE ENVIRONMENT

When the managed-system is in PowerVM management controller mode, the -f option is not allowed when activating a partition or performing a network install of an IBM i partition. For both of those operations partitions will be activated with their current configurations. The chsyscfg -r lpar and chsyscfg -r prof commands can be used to modify the current configuration of a partition before activating it.

The Hardware Management Console (HMC) must be the current PowerVM management controller for the managed-system when running the chsysstate -r lpar command.

The chsysstate -r sysprof and chsysstate -r sys -o onsysprof commands are not allowed.

## OPTIONS

-m The name of the managed system on which to perform the operation. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The

tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.

When powering on managed systems ( -o on or -o onstandby ), powering off or restarting managed systems ( -o off ), or rebuilding managed systems ( -o rebuild ), multiple managed system names can be specified with this option, or the --all option can be specified to perform the operation on all managed systems. Multiple managed system names must be comma separated.

This option is required when performing a partition or a system profile operation. When performing a managed system operation, either this option or the --all option is required.

The -m and --all options are mutually exclusive for managed system operations.

- -r The type of resource on which to perform the operation. Valid values are lpar for partition, sys for managed system, and sysprof for system profile.
- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are:
- on - activates a partition or a system profile, or powers on the managed-system . When powering on the managed-system , partitions that are marked as auto start are activated unless the managed system is an OpenPower managed system.

onstandby - powers on the managed-system to Standby state. onstartpolicy - powers on the managed-system as defined by the next partition start policy. onsysprof - powers on the managed-system then activates a system profile. Only those partitions in the system profile are activated. onhwdisc - powers on the managed-system and runs the hardware discovery process. When the hardware discovery process completes, the managed-system will be in Operating state, but no partitions will be automatically started. off - powers off the managed-system . If the --immed option is specified, a fast power off (operator panel function 8) is performed, otherwise a normal power off is performed.  If both the --immed and the --restart options are specified, a restart (operator panel function 3) of the managed-system is performed. rebuild - rebuilds the managed-system . recover - recovers partition data for the managed-system by restoring the data from the backup file on the HMC. spfailover - initiates service processor failover for the managed-system . chkey - sets the keylock position for a partition or the managed-system . shutdown - shuts down a partition. If the --immed option but not the --restart option is specified, an immediate shutdown (operator panel function 8) is performed. If the --restart option but not the --immed option is specified, a dumprestart operation (operator panel function 22)

is performed. If both the --immed and the --restart options are specified, an immediate restart (operator panel function 3) of the partition is performed. If neither the --immed nor the --restart option is specified, a delayed shutdown is performed. It is recommended that the chlparstate command be used to shut down a suspended partition. osshutdown - issues the operating system shutdown command to shut down a partition. If the --immed option is specified, the immediate option is included on the operating system shutdown command to immediately shut down the partition. If the --restart option is specified, the restart option is included on the operating system shutdown command to restart the partition. Normal operating system shutdown IBM i, with or without the --restart option, will take longer to complete. dumprestart - initiates a dump on the partition and restarts the partition when the dump is complete (operator panel function 22). retrydump - retries the dump on the partition and restarts the partition when the dump is complete (operator panel function 34). This operation is valid for IBM i partitions only. dston - activates dedicated service tools for the partition (operator panel function 21).  This operation is valid for IBM i partitions only. remotedstoff - disables a remote service session for the partition (operator panel function 65).  This operation is valid for IBM i partitions only. remotedston - enables a remote service session for the partition (operator panel function 66).  This operation is valid for IBM i partitions only. consoleservice - enables console service functions for the partition (operator panel function 65 followed by 21). This operation is valid for IBM i partitions only. iopreset - resets or reloads the failed IOP (operator panel function 67). This operation is valid for IBM i partitions only. iopdump - allows use of the IOP control storage dump (operator panel function 70). This operation is valid for IBM i partitions only.

- -f When activating a partition with a profile, use this option to specify the name of the partition profile to use.

If the managed-system is in the manufacturing default configuration and this option is not specified,  the  partition  will  be  activated  with  no  configuration  changes  and  the managed-system will remain in the manufacturing default configuration. If the managed-system is in the manufacturing default configuration and this option is specified, the partition will be activated with the configuration specified by partition-profile-name and the manufacturing default configuration will be permanently exited.

When powering on a managed system with a system profile, use this option to specify the name of the system profile to use. This option is required.

- -k The keylock position to set. Valid values are manual and norm for normal.

This  option  is  required  when  setting  the  keylock  position  for  a  partition  or  a  managed  system. This option is optional when powering on a managed system or activating a partition.

## --immed

If this option is specified when powering off a managed system, a fast power off is performed.

This option must be specified when restarting a managed system.

If this option is specified when shutting down or restarting a partition, an immediate shutdown or restart is performed.

If this option is specified, the partition or managed system will be restarted.

- -n When performing a system profile operation, use this option to specify the name of the system profile on which to perform the operation.

When performing a partition  operation,  use  this  option  to  specify  the  name  of  the  partition  on which to perform the operation, the --id option to specify the partition's ID, the --all option to perform the operation on all partitions, or the --allnonvios option to perform the operation on all partitions except Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partitions. The --all option is only allowed when activating partitions with their current configurations ( -o on ), or when shutting down or restarting partitions ( -o shutdown ).  The --allnonvios option is only allowed when shutting down or restarting partitions ( -o shutdown ).

## NAME

chtskey - change trusted system key

## SYNOPSIS

chtskey -m managed-system -o { change | restore } --newkey file [ --oldkey file ] [ --force ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

chtskey changes the trusted system key for the managed-system . The trusted system key is used for virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) data encryption.

If the trusted system key for a managed system is not set, the managed system automatically generates the default trusted system key when the first partition that uses vTPM is activated.

## OPTIONS

-m

The name of the managed system for which to set the trusted system key. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are change to set the trusted system key and re-encrypt vTPM data, and restore to set the trusted system key without re-encrypting vTPM data.

The  restore  operation  is  only  allowed  when  all  of  the  partitions  that  are  using  vTPM  are  shut down.

Re-encryption of vTPM data may take a long time to complete.

## --newkey

The name of the binary file that contains the new key.

If the file is on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

The name of the binary file that contains the current key. This option is not required the first time a user  sets  the  trusted  system  key  for  the managed-system . After  the  first  time,  this  option  is required.

If the file is on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

- --force Specify this option to force the trusted system key to be changed when vTPM data is still being reencrypted due to a previous trusted system key change operation. vTPM data loss may occur.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Set the trusted system key for the first time. The key file exists in the user's home directory on the HMC:

## chtskey -m sys1 -o change --newkey keyfile

Set the trusted system key after it has been set at least once. The key files are on a USB flash memory device which is connected to the HMC:

lsmediadev (to obtain mount points)

## NAME

cpsysplan - copy system plan

## SYNOPSIS

cpsysplan -r { ftp | sftp | nfs | media | homedir } -f file-name -o { import | export }

[ -h host-name ] [ -u user-ID ] [ --passwd password ] [ -k SSH-private-key ] [ -p ftp-port-number ] [ -d directory ] [ -l mount-location ] [ --options mount-command-options ] [ --check ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

cpsysplan copies a system plan file between the system plan file directory on the Hardware Management Console (HMC) and a remote server, removable media, or the user's home directory on the HMC.

## OPTIONS

- -r The location where the system plan file will be copied to or from. Valid values are ftp for an FTP server, sftp for  a  secure  FTP  (SFTP)  server, nfs for  an  NFS  file  system, media for  removable media, and homedir for the user's home directory on the HMC.

If media is  specified,  the  media  must  be  present  in  the  removable  media  device  and  the  device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is run. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

- -f Specifies the name of the system plan file that is to be copied. The file name is restricted to the alphanumerics (upper and lower) as well as a set of special characters (comma, period, hyphen, underscore, and space). The file name cannot begin with a period or hyphen and must end with the .sysplan suffix.

cpsysplan performs a raw file copy. It does not parse or validate the system plan file content.

When copying from the HMC, the file will be searched for in the system plan file directory on the HMC.  When copying to the HMC, the file will be written to this  directory. If the  file  already exists, it will be overwritten unless the --check option is specified.

- -o Specifies if the system plan file is to be copied to or from the system plan file directory on the HMC. Valid values are export to copy the file from the HMC to the resource location specified or import to copy the file from the resource location specified to the system plan file directory on the HMC.
- -h The host name or IP address of the remote server.

This option is required when copying a system plan file to or from a remote server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP server.

This option is required when copying a system plan file to or from a remote FTP or SFTP server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP server.

If this option is omitted and the system plan file is being copied to or from a remote FTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  If both this option and the -k option are omitted and the  system plan file is  being  copied  to  or  from  a  remote  SFTP  server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when copying a system plan file to or from a remote FTP or SFTP server.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If both this option and the --passwd option are omitted and the system plan file is being copied to or from a remote SFTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when copying a system plan file to or from a remote SFTP server.

- -l The mount location defined on the NFS server where the system plan file will be copied to or from.

This option is required when copying a system plan file to or from an NFS file system. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

The HMC supports NFS versions 3 and 4, and this command uses version 3 by default.  To use version 4, include the option vers=4 .

This option is only valid when copying a system plan file to or from an NFS file system.

- -p The port number to use for the remote FTP server. If this option is omitted, the default FTP port 21 will be used.

This option is only valid when copying a system plan file to or from a remote FTP server.

- -d When copying a system plan file to or from a remote server, specify the name of the directory on the remote server to use. If this option is not specified when copying a system plan file to or from a remote FTP or SFTP server, the directory will default to the user's home directory. If this option is not specified when copying a system plan file to or from an NFS file system, the directory will default to the mount-location on the NFS server.

When copying a system plan file to or from media, this option is required. The directory is the name of the mounted removable media where the system plan file will be copied to or from.

## --check

When importing a system plan file, specify this option to check the system plan directory and fail with an error if a file with the name specified with the -f option already exists.

This option is only valid when importing a system plan file.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

Use the d option to skip validation of the system plan against the managed system, and just deploy the plan-specified partitions and profiles on the managed system.

- -m Specifies the managed system's name where the plan should be deployed. The system plan optionally specifies the managed system's name where that system plan was intended to be deployed. If a managed system name is specified with this option, that name would override the plan-provided name. If no  managed  system  name  was  specified  in  the  system  plan  file  then  this  option  is required.

The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form ttttmmm*ssssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and ssssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt-mmm*ssssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

- --force If  the  managed system has existing partitions that the system plan contains that are in an active state, this option allows this command to proceed. Otherwise, if active partitions are found, this command will fail with an error message.
- --plan System plan files can contain more than one system plan. If the file contains more than one plan, this option specifies the name of the system plan to deploy. If this name is not specified, then the first system plan in the file is deployed. If there is only one system plan in the file, this option is ignored.
- -v When -o v is specified, this option specifies that a list of identifiers that identify the steps of the validated  system  plan  should  be  written  to  stdout.  These  steps  are  part  of  the  plan  but  not  yet implemented on the managed system. Otherwise, this list will not be written out.

When -o dv or -o d is specified, this option specifies that a list of log entries that record the steps performed as part of deploying the system plan should be written to stdout. Otherwise, this list will not be written out.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Deploy a system plan from the file mysysplan.sysplan onto the managed system configured in the file. Validate the plan against the managed system before deploying it:

## deploysysplan -f mysysplan.sysplan -o dv

Deploy a system plan from the file mysysplan.sysplan onto managed system mySystem . Validate the plan against  the  managed  system  before  deploying  it.  Deploy the  plan,  if  valid,  even though  there  might  be active partitions on the managed system:

## deploysysplan -f mysysplan.sysplan -o dv -m mySystem --force

Deploy a system plan from the file mysysplan.sysplan onto the managed system identified by the machine type, model, and serial number 9406-570*34134888 . Validate the plan against the managed system before deploying it. Write any errors found in validation or deployment to stdout:

## deploysysplan -f mysysplan.sysplan -o dv -m 9406-570*34134888 -v

Validate  the  ability  to  deploy a system  plan  from  the  file multisysplan.sysplan onto  managed  system mySystem . Use the third system plan that appears in this file (the system plan file has at least three system plans). Validate the plan specified against the managed system to determine if that plan can be deployed there but do not actually deploy the plan:

## deploysysplan -f multisysplan.sysplan -o v -m mySystem --plan 3

Validate the ability to deploy a system plan from the file mysysplan.sysplan onto managed system mySystem . Validate the plan against the managed system to determine if that plan can be deployed there but do not actually deploy the plan. Write out the steps in the system plan that are part of the plan but not yet implemented to stdout. Write any errors found in validation or deployment to stdout:

## deploysysplan -f mysysplan.sysplan -o v -m mySystem -v

```

## DESCRIPTION

getfile obtains and deploys a file of the specified type on the Hardware Management Console (HMC).

## OPTIONS

- -t The  type  of  file  to  get  and  deploy.  Valid  values  are krbkeyfile for  the  Kerberos  service  key (keytab) file, ldapcacert for the LDAP Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file, powersccacert for the for the PowerSC MFA client truststore key file, powersctrust for the PowerSC endpoint truststore  file, rsyslogcacert for  the  rsyslog  CA  certificate  file, rsysloghmccert for  the  rsyslog HMC certificate file, rsysloghmckey for the rsyslog HMC private key file, and bmccacert for the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) or Enterprise BMC CA certificate file.

The Kerberos service key file is generated on a Key Distribution Center (KDC) server. The service key  file  contains  the  host  principal  that  identifies  the  HMC  to  the  KDC  server. When this command is run, the file obtained will become the /etc/krb5.keytab file  on  the  HMC. This file will be used to verify the identity of the KDC and the HMC during remote Kerberos authentication of  HMC users. Kerberos must be configured on the HMC before this command is run, and the HMC must be rebooted after the successful completion of this command for the change to take effect.

The LDAP CA certificate file contains the certificate for the Certificate Authority the HMC recognizes. This file  will  be  used  to  provide  a  secure  connection  between  the  HMC  and  the  LDAP server during remote LDAP authentication of HMC users. LDAP must be configured on the HMC before this command is run.

The  rsyslog  CA  certificate  file,  rsyslog  HMC  certificate  file,  and  rsyslog  HMC  private  key  file must be deployed on the HMC before TLS encrypted system logging over TCP can be enabled. These 3 files will automatically be removed from the HMC when TLS encrypted system logging over TCP is disabled.

- -l The location where the file to get resides.

Specify l with this option if the file has already been copied to the HMC or resides on removable media.  If the file resides on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

Specify s with this option if the file resides on a remote site. Secure FTP (SFTP) will be used to obtain the file from the remote site.

- -f The fully qualified name of the file on the HMC, removable media, or remote site.
- -a The alias to identify the BMC or Enterprise BMC CA certificate.

This option is required when getting the BMC or Enterprise BMC CA certificate. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -h The host name or IP address of the SFTP server from which to get the file.

None

This option is required when file resides on a remote site. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote site.

This option is required when file resides on a remote site. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote site.

If  both  this  option  and  the -k option  are  omitted  and file resides  on  a  remote  site,  you  will  be prompted to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when file resides on a remote site.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If both this option and the --passwd option are omitted and file resides on a remote site, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when file resides on a remote site.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Get  the  Kerberos  service  key  file  from  the  remote  site sftpserver using  SFTP, then  deploy the  file  as /etc/krb5.keytab on the HMC (you will be prompted to enter the user's password):

## getfile -t krbkeyfile -l s -h sftpserver -u sftpuser

- -f /home/sftpuser/krb5.keytab

Get the rsyslog CA certificate file from the remote site sftpserver using SFTP and SSH keys for authentication, then deploy the file on the HMC:

installios installs the Virtual I/O Server. It must be run from the Hardware Managment Console (HMC). All of the flags are optional. If no flags are provided, the installios wizard will be invoked and the user will be prompted to interactively enter the information contained in the flags.

## Please note:

If  the  managed  system  is  in  co-management  mode  (set  with is\_controller=1 ) when  listed  with  the lscomgmt command, the partition profile value will need to be ommitted.

## OPTIONS

- -s Specifies the managed system. The name of the managed system maintained by the HMC. This name must match the name shown on the HMC, not a host name.
- -p Specifies the partition name. The name of the LPAR that will be installed with Virtual I/O Server operating system. This partition must be of type Virtual I/O Server and the name given for it must match the name shown on the HMC, not a host name.
- -r Specifies  the profile name.  The  name  of  the profile that  contains  the  hardware  resources  being installed to.
- -d Specifies the path to installation images. Valid path types are:

/dev/cdrom - for installation images on DVD

/dev/ usb-device-name - for installation images on USB device. The lsmediadev command can be used to display the device name of the USB device.

localpath - for a system backup of the Virtual I/O Server created by the backupios command -- or for an ISO image of Virtual I/O Server install media -- that resides in the directory localpath on the HMC. When using an ISO image, localpath should include the image filename of the first volume.  If the ISO image span multiple volumes, the installios will automatically locate the remaining volumes, provided they reside within the same directory as the first.

nfs\_server:remote\_path\_to\_image - for a system backup of the Virtual I/O Server, created by the backupios  command,  that  resides  in  the remote\_path\_to\_image location  on  the  NFS  server, nfs\_server . Installation from an ISO image is not supported when an NFS path is used.

- -i Specifies the client IP address. The IP address with which the client's network interface will be configured for network installation of the Virtual I/O Server operating system.
- -S Specifies the client subnet mask. The subnet mask with which the client's network interface will be configured for network installation of the Virtual I/O Server operating system.

- -g Specifies the client gateway . The default gateway that the client will use during network installation of the Virtual I/O Server operating system.
- -m Specifies the client MAC address. The MAC address of the client network interface through which the network installation of the Virtual I/O Server will take place.
- -P Specifies speed (optional) The communication speed with which to configure the client's network interface. This value can be 10, 100, 1000, or auto, and is 100 by default if this flag is not specified. For newer machines, a speed value of auto is desired although this value is determined by the network configuration of the environment and the network adapter of the installing machine.
- -D Specifies duplex (optional). The duplex setting with which to configure the client's network interface. This value can be full, half or auto and is set to full by default if this flag is not specified. For newer machines, a duplex value of auto is desired although this value is determined by the network configuration of the environment and the network adapter of the installing machine.
- -n Specifies not to configure the client's network interface (optional): If this flag is specified, then the client's network interface will not be configured with the IP settings specified in the flags given to this command after the installation has completed.
- -l Specifies language (optional):  The language in  which  the  license  agreement  will  be  displayed before the installation. Upon viewing the license, a prompt will be shown asking if the license is to be accepted. If the prompt is answered with y, then the installation will proceed and the Virtual I/O Server license will be automatically accepted after the installation. If the prompt is answered with n,  then  the installios command will exit and the installation will not proceed. If this flag is not specified, then the installation will proceed, but the Virtual I/O Server will not be usable until the license is manually accepted after the installation.
- -A Specifies net\_interface (optional): The specified net\_interface will be used to network install the partition. The network interface specified must be connected to a network in which the partition's IP address is reachable. If no interface is specified, a default public interface will be chosen automatically, based on the HMC's current hostname.
- -E Specifies bosinst\_pvid (optional): The specified bosinst\_pvid value signifies the physical volume identity for a disk targeted for installation. The bosinst\_pvid value can be obtained by running the lspv command on the machine being installed.
- -T Specifies destination\_dir (optional): The specified destination\_dir points to a path were the source will be copied to on the HMC. The default destination path is the /extra filesystem.
- -V Specifies the VLAN tag identifier to use for tagging Ethernet frames during network install for virtual network communication. Valid value is from 0 to 4094 (optional).
- -Y Specifies the VLAN tag priority to use for tagging Ethernet frames during network install for virtual network communication. Valid value is from 0 to 7 (optional).
- -C Specifies the option to save the label name and its image for later use (optional). To remove the saved labels and its image, use the -e flag to erase the label from /etc/nimol.conf.
- -R Specifies a label name for installios to use instead of creating a default label name (optional).
- -y Specifies the maximum number of BOOTP retry attempts. Valid value is from 0 to 9 (optional). The default value is 5 .
- -z Specifies the maximum number of TFTP retry attempts. Valid value is from 0 to 9 (optional).  The default value is 5 .
- -u Unconfigure installios (optional). Will manually unconfigure the installios installation resources. This flag is only needed if a problem occurs during the installation and installios does not automatically unconfigure itself. However,  if the -C flag  is  specified, installios will not unconfigure itself. If a label exists in the installios configuration file /etc/nimol.conf, the labels will need to be removed first in order to unconfigure installios.

- -q Query installios for labels created (optional). The installios command creates labels when it rips installable images from the source image to disk. The labels are stored in /etc/nimol.conf and are linked to clients when they are being used for installation. The query flag will list out the labels known to installios.
- -e Erase a label known to installios (optional). When executing the installios command with the -R label, it creates a label when it rips the installable images from the source image to disk. The label is  stored in /etc/nimol.conf and its reference to install resources are linked to a client when it is used for installation. The query flag will list out the labels known to installios.
- -F Force the operation to continue and to bypass certain checking that may be preventing installios to run (optional).
- -o Specifies the NFS option to use when mounting install resources from a remote server (optional).

## ENVIRONMENT INSTALLIOS\_DEBUG

This  variable  is  use  to  print  debug  messages  from lpar\_netboot when installios executes  the lpar\_netboot command.  This variable is set with INSTALLIOS\_DEBUG=yes . When executing the installios command in the wizard mode, this variable must not be set as the debug output from lpar\_netboot will interfere with the MAC address discovery resulting in a failed execution. This variable must only be set when executing installios on the command line with flags.

## INSTALLIOS\_PRIVATE\_IF

This variable is used by installios to enable DHCP service when responding to BOOTP request from an installing partition. This variable must only be use in situation where the FSP (Flexible Service Processor) and the installing partition communicate with the HMC through a private network.  If the private network the HMC is using is eth0, then this variable is set with INSTAL-LIOS\_PRIVATE\_IF=eth0 .

## INSTALLIOS\_DESTINATION\_DIRECTORY

This variable is used by installios to specify the destination directory to copy the source to. This variable is set with INSTALLIOS\_DESTINATION\_DIRECTORY=/info . This variable is overridden by the -T destination\_dir flag. In certain situation where calling installios fails due to space limitation when copying over the source image, setting this variable or the -T flag to an alternate location with space capable of storing the content of the source location will resolve the situation.

## NAME

labelvios - label Virtual I/O Servers

## SYNOPSIS

labelvios -o { a | r | s } -m managed-system [ -l label ] [{ -f input-data-file | -i " input-data " }] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

labelvios configures Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) Fibre Channel (FC) port labels or VIOS group labels, or changes the default VIOS label override settings on a managed system.

VIOS FC port labels are used for partition migration and partition  remote  restart  operations. The same label names must be defined on both the source and destination VIOS FC ports used in the operation.

VIOS group labels are also used for partition migration and partition remote restart operations. The same label names must be defined on both the source and destination managed systems used in the operation.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are a to add a VIOS group label, r to remove a VIOS FC port label or one or more VIOS group labels, and s to configure a VIOS FC port label, to change the attributes of a VIOS group label, or to change the default VIOS label override settings for the managed system.
- -m The name of the managed system for which to perform the operation. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.
- -l The name of the VIOS FC port label to set, or the name of the VIOS group label to add, remove, or set.

When removing a VIOS group label, you can use this option to specify the name of the label to remove, or you can specify the resource attribute  to  remove  all  labels  of  the  specified  resource type.

This option is required when setting a VIOS FC port label, when adding a VIOS group label, and when changing the attributes of a VIOS group label. This option is  optional  when  removing  a VIOS group label. This option is not valid when removing a VIOS FC port label or changing the default VIOS label override settings.

- -f The  name  of  the  file  containing  the  input  data  for  this  command. The  input  data  consists  of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The format of the input data is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

If ' += ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', the specified value is added to the existing list. += can be used in set operations only.

If ' -= ' is used in the attribute name/value pair instead of ' = ', the specified value is deleted from the existing list. -= can be used in set operations only.

logssh - log ssh command usage

## SYNOPSIS

logssh

## DESCRIPTION

logssh is a script that can be added to a user's authorized\_keys2 file to restrict a user from being able to open a pseudo-tty using ssh. Furthermore, it will log all commands executed by the user in syslog. This command is not intended to be run interactively.

Note: The logssh ${SSH\_ORIGINAL\_COMMAND} argument has been deprecated and will be ignored if passed to the script.

## EXAMPLES

Use the command mkauthkeys to update a user's authorized\_keys2 file:

mkauthkeys -a -u john «command="logssh" ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAzxTNjoX AvyZBw390oJ27uj90PxZNtUWhYVN1/kaAfilSIr3z5Hhm7BdaaarU ru94qhiM0xds6cgQpNUQUy6GByoWDrNhdEIdAzXj3uaPscY6wKkNi a0llTJPUoBDBsadaa4oEc0/4poNG/X3uYrsdnbbMNkt/jmnEilSXI gOEmWk= john@somehost«

The  above  command  updates  user john 's authorized\_keys2 file  on  the  HMC,  so  that  all  commands executed by john will be logged in syslog.

## ssh john@somehmc lshmc -V

The above command will result in the following entries being logged in /var/log/messages :

Nov 28 15:08:14 somehmc hmc\_ssh: john login on Tue Nov 28

## DESCRIPTION

lpar\_netboot instructs a logical partition to network boot by having it send out a bootp request to a server specified with the -S option. The server can be an AIX NIM server serving SPOT resources or any server serving network boot images. If specified with the -M and -n options, lpar\_netboot will return the Media Access Control (MAC) address and the physical location code for a network adapter of the type specified with the -t option. When the -m option is specified, lpar\_netboot will boot a partition using the network adapter which has the specified MAC address. When the -l option is specified, lpar\_netboot will boot a partition using the network adapter which has the specified physical location code. The MAC address and physical location code of a network adapter is dependent upon the hardware resource allocation in the partition  profile  the  partition  was  booted  with.  The lpar\_netboot command requires arguments for  partition name, partition profile, and the name of the managed system which has the partition.

## Please note:

If  the  managed  system  is  in  co-management  mode  (set  with is\_controller=1 ) when  listed  with  the lscomgmt command, the partition  profile  value  will  need  to  be  blanked  out  with  "".  The lpar\_netboot

command will also ignore the partition profile value if its managed system is in co-management mode.

## OPTIONS

- -A Return all adapters of the type specified with the -t option.
- -B Network boot image filename, required option if IPv6 addresses.
- -C The IP address of the partition to network boot.
- -D Perform a ping test and use the adapter that successfully pings the server specified with the -S option.
- -E Set environment variable setting. The -E LPAR\_NETBOOT\_DEBUG=1 is the same as export LPAR\_NETBOOT\_DEBUG=1 . See ENVIRONMENT .
- -G The gateway IP address of the partition specified with the -C option.
- -K Subnetmask IP address.
- -M Discover network adapter MAC address and physical location code.
- -S The IP  address  of  the  machine  from  which  to  retrieve  the  network  boot  image  during  network boot.
- -T Enable or disble firmware spanning tree discovery. Valid values are on , off .
- -V Specifies the VLAN tag identifier to use for tagging Ethernet frames during network install for virtual network communication. Valid value is from 0 to 4094 .
- -Y Specifies the VLAN tag priority to use for tagging Ethernet frames during network install for virtual network communication. Valid value is from 0 to 7 .
- -a Network ip addresses for server, client and gateway are IPv6.

file -r { ftp | sftp } -h host-name -u user-ID [ --passwd password ] [ -k SSH-private-key ]
```

[ -d directory ] [ -c IBM-case-number ] [ --help ]

To remove collected VIOS debug data from the HMC hard disk:

lpardbg -o r -f file [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

lpardbg collects debug data from Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partitions on the managed system and sends the debug data to a remote server.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are c to collect debug data and send it to a remote server or save it on the HMC hard disk, s to send debug data that was already collected to a remote server, and r to remove collected debug data files from the HMC hard disk.

Debug data files that are successfully sent to a remote server are automatically removed from the HMC hard disk.

- -t The type of partitions from which to collect debug data. The only valid value is vios to collect debug data from Virtual I/O Servers.
- -m The name of the managed system which has the VIOSs from which to collect debug data. The name  may  either  be  the  user-defined  name  for  the  managed  system,  or  be  in  the  form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -p The name of one or more VIOSs from which to collect debug data. Multiple VIOS names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the names of the VIOSs from which to collect debug data, the --id option  to  specify  the  IDs  of  the  VIOSs  from  which  to  collect  debug  data,  or  the --all option  to  collect  debug  data  from  all  VIOSs  on  the managed-system . The -p , --id , and --all options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of one or more VIOSs from which to collect debug data. Multiple  VIOS IDs must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the IDs of the VIOSs from which to collect debug data, the -p option to specify the names of the VIOSs from which to collect debug data, or the --all option  to  collect  debug  data  from  all  VIOSs  on  the managed-system . The --id , -p , and --all options are mutually exclusive.

- --all Specify this option to collect debug data from all VIOSs on the managed-system .

You can either use this option, the -p option to specify the names of the VIOSs from which to collect debug data, or the --id option to specify the IDs of the VIOSs from which to collect debug data.  The --all , -p , and --id options are mutually exclusive.

- -r The remote location where the debug data will be sent. Valid values are ftp for a FTP server and sftp for a secure FTP (SFTP) server.

If this option is omitted when -o c is specified, the collected debug data will only be saved on the HMC hard disk.

- -h The host name or IP address of the remote server.
- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote server.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote server.

If this option is omitted when sending debug data to a remote FTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  If both this option and the -k option are omitted when sending debug data to a remote SFTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If  both  this  option  and  the --passwd option  are  omitted  when  sending  debug  data  to  a  remote SFTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when sending debug data to a remote SFTP server.

## DESCRIPTION

lshwres lists the hardware resources of the managed-system , including physical I/O, virtual I/O, memory, shared memory pool, persistent memory, processing, shared processor pool, Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), and hardware accelerator resources.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of hardware resources to list. Valid values are io for physical I/O, virtualio for virtual I/O, mem for  memory, mempool for  shared  memory  pool, rspool for  reserved  storage  device pool, pmem for persistent memory, proc for processing, procpool for shared processor pool, sriov for SR-IOV, and accel for hardware accelerator resources.

The procpool resource type is only supported for managed systems that support multiple shared processor pools.

The rspool resource type is only supported for managed systems that support partition suspend and resume operations.

## --rsubtype

The subtype of hardware resources to list. Valid physical I/O resource subtypes are unit for I/O units, bus for  I/O  buses, slot for  I/O  slots, iopool for  I/O  pools, taggedio for  tagged  I/O,  and slotchildren for I/O slot children resources. Valid virtual I/O resource subtypes are eth for virtual ethernet, fc for  virtual  fibre  channel, virtualopti for  virtual  OptiConnect, scsi for  virtual  SCSI, serial for virtual serial, slot for virtual slot, vnetwork for virtual network, vnic for virtual NIC, vnicbkdev for virtual NIC backing devices, and vswitch for virtual switch resources. Valid SRIOV resource subtypes are adapter for  SR-IOV adapter  resources, logport for  SR-IOV logical port  resources,  and physport for  SR-IOV physical  port  resources. Valid  persistent  memory resource subtypes are volume for persistent memory volume resources. Valid hardware accelerator resource subtypes are gzip for GZIP hardware accelerator resources.

The only valid shared memory pool resource subtype is pgdev for paging space devices.  The only valid reserved storage device pool subtype is rsdev for reserved storage devices.  On a managed system  that  supports  Active  Memory  Sharing  and  partition  suspend  and  resume  operations,  the command lshwres  -m managed-system -r  mempool  --rsubtype  pgdev lists  the  devices  in  the reserved storage device pool, and is equivalent to the command lshwres -m managed-system -r rspool --rsubtype rsdev .

This option is required when listing physical I/O, virtual I/O, or SR-IOV resources.  This option is not valid when listing memory, processing, or shared processor pool resources.

- -m The name of the managed system which has the hardware resources to list. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.
- --level The level of information to list. Valid values are lpar for partition, pool for pool, slot for slot, sys for  system, eth for  ethernet, ethc for  converged  ethernet,  and roce for  RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE).

This option is required when listing I/O pool resources, virtual ethernet, virtual fibre channel, virtual serial, or virtual slot resources, memory or processing resources, SR-IOV physical ports, or hardware accelerator resources.

Valid levels for I/O pool resources are pool or sys . Valid levels for virtual ethernet resources are lpar or sys . Valid levels for virtual fibre channel resources are lpar or sys . Valid levels for virtual serial resources are lpar . Valid levels for virtual slot resources are lpar , slot , or sys . Valid levels for virtual NIC resources are lpar or sys . Valid levels for memory resources are lpar or sys . Valid levels for persistent memory resources are lpar or sys . Valid levels for processing resources are lpar , pool , or sys . Valid levels for SR-IOV logical ports are eth or roce . Valid levels for SR-IOV physical ports are eth , ethc or roce . Valid levels for hardware accelerator resources are lpar or sys .

- -R Only list information for partitions with hardware resources that can be restored due to a dynamic logical partitioning (DLPAR) operation failure.

The rsthwres command can be used to restore those hardware resources.

This  option  is  only  valid  for  listing  physical  I/O  slots,  partition  level memory  or  processing resources, or SR-IOV logical ports.

## --maxmem

When this option is specified, the required minimum memory amount needed for partitions to support the maximum memory quantity and Hardware Page Table ratio specified is listed. All memory quantities are in megabytes, and are a multiple of the memory region size for the managed-system .

This information is useful for specifying memory amounts in partition profiles.

The required minimum memory amount listed is the minimum memory amount required for a partition by the managed system's system firmware.  An operating system installed on the partition may require more memory than the amount listed.

This option is only valid when listing system level memory resources.

## --hptratio

The ratio of the Hardware Page Table (HPT) size to the maximum memory for a partition. Valid values for the managed-system are displayed by the lshwres -r mem -m managed-system --level sys -F possible\_hpt\_ratios command.

If this option is not used to specify an HPT ratio, the default HPT ratio for the managed-system is used.

This option is only valid when used with the --maxmem option.

- --stat When this option is specified when listing partition level memory resources, I/O entitled memory statistics are listed.

--filter

This option is only valid when listing partition level memory resources.

The filter(s) to apply to the hardware resources to be listed. Filters are used to select which hardware resources of the specified type are to be listed. If no filters are used, then all of the hardware resources of the specified type will be listed. For example, all of the physical I/O slots on a specific I/O unit and bus can be listed by using a filter to specify the I/O unit and the bus which has the slots to list. Otherwise, if no filter is used, then all of the physical I/O slots in the managed system will be listed.

The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

" filter-name = value , filter-name = value , ... "

Note that certain filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

"" filter-name = value , value , ... ", ... "

When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Unless otherwise indicated, multiple values can be specified for each filter.

When listing I/O entitled memory statistics for a partition, this parameter is required, and exactly one partition name or ID must be specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter.

Valid filter names for this command:

```
adapter_ids Specify SR-IOV adapter ID(s) buses Specify I/O bus ID(s) logical_port_ids Specify SR-IOV logical port ID(s) lpar_ids Specify partition ID(s) lpar_names Specify partition user-defined name(s) phys_port_ids Specify SR-IOV physical port ID(s) pool_names Specify pool name(s) pools Specify pool ID(s) slots Specify physical I/O slot DRC index(ices) or virtual I/O slot number(s) units Specify I/O unit physical location code(s) vlans Specify virtual LAN ID(s) vswitches
```

[ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help

## DESCRIPTION

lsiotopo lists the physical I/O slot topology of the managed-system .

lsiotopo is useful for displaying the I/O topology of multi-node managed systems.

## OPTIONS

- -m The name of the managed system for which to list the I/O topology. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.
- -r The type of I/O resources to list. Valid values are slot to list physical I/O slot topology. If this option is omitted, the physical I/O slot topology will be listed.
- --filter The filters to apply to the I/O resources to be listed. Filters are used to select which I/O resources are to be listed. For example, to list only the physical I/O slots in a specific system enclosure and fabric bus, use the sys\_enclosures and fabric\_bus\_ids filters.

The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

" filter-name = value , filter-name = value , ... "

Note that certain filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

"" filter-name = value , value , ... ", ... "

When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Multiple values can be specified for each filter.

## NAME

lslic - list Licensed Internal Code levels

## SYNOPSIS

```
lslic { -m managed-system | -c } [ -t { sys | io | sriov | bmc | pnor | bmcpnor }] [ -r { ibmwebsite | ftp | sftp | dvd | disk | mountpoint | usb } [ -l { update | upgrade | downgrade }]] [ -h host-name ] [ -u user-ID ] [ --passwd password ] [ -k SSH-private-key ] [ -d directory ] [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

lslic lists  Licensed  Internal  Code  (LIC)  levels  installed,  activated,  and  accepted.  The  LIC  levels  that  are available to be retrieved from a repository can also be listed.

lslic can also list the LIC levels currently in the Hardware Management Console (HMC) hard disk repository.

## OPTIONS

- -m The name of the managed system for which LIC levels are to be listed. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.
- -c List all LIC level files currently in the HMC hard disk repository.

To list only the LIC level installation packages that are currently in the HMC hard disk repository, run the lslic -m managed-system -r disk command with the -l option.

- -t The type of LIC levels to list. Valid  values  are sys for  managed system LIC levels, io for  I/O adapter levels, sriov for  Single  Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) adapter levels, bmc for  Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware levels, pnor for PNOR firmware levels, or bmcpnor for both BMC and PNOR firmware levels.

The bmc , pnor , and bmcpnor values are valid for OpenPower managed systems only. No other values are valid for OpenPower managed systems.

If this option is omitted, it will default to bmcpnor for OpenPower managed systems and to sys for other types of managed systems. This option is not valid with the -c option.

- -r The repository to query for LIC levels that are available to be retrieved.  Valid values are ibmwebsite for the IBM service website, ftp for a remote FTP site, sftp for a remote secure FTP (SFTP) site, dvd for  the  DVD  drive  on the  HMC, disk for  the  internal  hard  disk  drive  on the  HMC, mountpoint for the specified mount point on the internal hard disk drive on the HMC, or usb for a USB flash memory device.

When used with the -l option, only the LIC levels where the installation package and cover letter both  exist  in  the  repository  are  displayed. This  option  can  be  used  to  display  what  installation packages have been staged to the local disk repository, or to display the installation packages in the specified repository.

This option is not valid with the -c option.

- -l When displaying LIC levels that are available to be retrieved from a repository, use this option to specify the operation type of the LIC levels to list. Valid values are update to list update LIC levels  only, upgrade to  list  upgrade  LIC  levels  only, or downgrade to  list  downgrade  LIC  levels only. If this option is omitted, LIC levels of all operation types will be listed.

When this option is used, only the LIC levels where the installation package and cover letter both exist in the repository are displayed.

This  option  is  only  valid  when  displaying  LIC  levels  that  are  available  to  be  retrieved from  a repository.

- -h The host name or IP address of the remote FTP or SFTP server.

This option is required when displaying LIC levels that are available to be retrieved from a remote FTP or SFTP site. This option is not valid otherwise.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP site.

This option is required when displaying LIC levels that are available to be retrieved from a remote FTP or SFTP site. This option is not valid otherwise.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP site.

If this option is omitted when displaying LIC levels that are available to be retrieved from a remote FTP site, you will be prompted to enter the password.  If both this option and the -k option are omitted when displaying LIC levels that are available to be retrieved from a remote SFTP site, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This  option  is  only  valid  when  displaying  LIC  levels  that  are  available  to  be  retrieved from  a remote FTP or SFTP site.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If both this option and the --passwd option are omitted when displaying LIC levels that are available to be retrieved from a remote SFTP site, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This  option  is  only  valid  when  displaying  LIC  levels  that  are  available  to  be  retrieved from  a remote SFTP site.

- -d The directory to use on the remote FTP or SFTP site, or the mount point location on the internal HMC hard disk drive. If this option is not specified for FTP or SFTP, the /opt/sfp/data/updates directory will be used.

This  option  is  only  valid  when  displaying  LIC  levels  that  are  available  to  be  retrieved from  a mount point or a remote FTP or SFTP site.

- -F A delimiter separated list  of  attribute  names  for  the  desired  attribute  values  to  be  displayed  for each LIC level.  If no attribute names are specified, then values for all of the attributes for each LIC level will be displayed.

When this option is specified, only attribute values will be displayed. No attribute names will be displayed.  The attribute values displayed will be separated by the delimiter which was specified with this option.

This option is useful when only attribute values are desired to be displayed, or when the values of only selected attributes are desired to be displayed.

## --header

Display a header record, which is a delimiter separated list of attribute names for the attribute values that will be displayed. This header record will be the first record displayed. This option is only valid when used with the -F option.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

lslparmigr - list partition migration information

## SYNOPSIS

```
lslparmigr -r { lpar | mc | mem | mempool | msp | procpool | sriov | sys | virtualio } [ -m managed-system ] [ -t target-managed-system [ --ip IP-address [ -u user-ID ]]] [ --redundantsriovadapters { 1 | 2 }] [ --redundantvios { 0 | 1 | 2 }] [ --redundantvnicbkdev { 1 | 2 }] [ --sriovlogportcfg { 1 | 2 }] [ --vniccfg { 1 | 2 }] [ --viosfcportlabel { 1 | 2 }] [ --viosmsplabel { 1 | 2 }] [ --viosstoragelabel { 1 | 2 }] [ --viosvniclabel { 1 | 2 }] [ --filter " filter-data " ] [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

lslparmigr lists partition migration information.

## OPTIONS

-r The type of resources for which to list partition migration information.

Specify lpar to list partition migration information for all of the partitions in managed-system .

Specify mc to list partition mobility capabilities for the Hardware Management Console (HMC).

Specify mem to list the memory requirements, including persistent memory requirements, for the partition specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter, and also list the available memory on the destination managed system.

Specify mempool to  list  shared  memory  pool  information  for  the  destination  managed  system. Shared memory pool information is only listed if the shared memory pool has enough available memory for the partition specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter, if there is an available paging space device for the partition, and if the paging VIOS redundancy requirement of the partition can be satisfied. The redundant attribute that is listed indicates whether or not the partition would be configured to use redundant paging VIOS partitions on the destination managed system (a value of 0 indicates the partition would be configured to not use redundant paging VIOS partitions, and a value of 1 indicates the partition would be configured to use redundant paging VIOS partitions).

Specify msp to list possible source and destination mover service partition (MSP) pairs for active partition migration of the partitions specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter.

Specify procpool to list possible shared processor pools in the destination managed system that have  enough  available  processing  resources  for  the  partition  specified  with  the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter.

Specify sriov to list possible and suggested mappings of the migratable SR-IOV logical ports in the partition specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter.

Specify sys to list the partition mobility capabilities for managed-system .

Specify virtualio to  list  possible  and  suggested  mappings  of  the  virtual  Fibre  Channel  (FC) adapters, virtual SCSI adapters, and virtual NICs in the partition specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter.

- -m The name of the managed system for which to list partition migration information. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form  must  be  used  if  there  are  multiple  managed  systems  with  the same user-defined name.

When listing memory, shared memory pool, mover service partition, shared processor pool, or virtual  I/O  information,  specify  the  source  managed  system  for  the  partition  migration  with  this option.

This option is not valid when listing partition mobility capabilities for the HMC. This option is required when listing all other types of partition migration information.

- -t The name of the target, or destination, managed system for the partition migration. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form  must  be  used  if  there  are  multiple  managed  systems  with  the same user-defined name.

This option is required when listing memory, shared memory pool, mover service partition, shared processor pool, or virtual I/O information. This option is not valid when listing any other type of partition migration information.

- --ip If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, then use this option to specify the IP address or host name of the management console that is managing the destination managed system.

To  use this option, SSH must be enabled on both management consoles. Also, you must run the mkauthkeys command once to set up SSH key authentication.

- -u If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, then use this option to specify the user ID to use on the management console that is managing the destination managed system. If you do not specify the user ID, then the user ID of the user that issues this command will be used.

## --redundantsriovadapters

When listing migratable SR-IOV logical port information, use this option to specify the SR-IOV adapter redundancy requirement of the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports on the destination managed system. When listing virtual I/O information, use this option to specify the SR-IOV adapter redundancy requirement of the partition's virtual NIC backing devices on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if SR-IOV adapter redundancy is required to be maintained, or 2 if SR-IOV adapter redundancy is to be maintained if possible. If this option is not specified, this option defaults to the value 2 .

If  this  option  has  a  value  of 1 , the  HMC must maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy when mapping the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports or virtual NIC backing devices to the destination managed system. For example, if two migratable SR-IOV logical ports or two virtual NIC backing devices are on the same SR-IOV adapter on the source managed system, they must be mapped to the same SR-IOV adapter on the destination managed system. If two migratable SRIOV logical  ports  or  two virtual  NIC  backing  devices  are  on  different  SR-IOV adapters  on  the source  managed  system,  they must  be  mapped  to  different  SR-IOV adapters  on  the  destination managed system.

This option is only valid when listing migratable SR-IOV logical port information or virtual I/O information.

## --redundantvios , --redundantpgvios

When listing shared memory pool information, use this option to specify the paging VIOS redundancy requirement for the partition on the destination managed system. Valid values are 0 if the partition is not to use redundant paging VIOS partitions, 1 if the partition is required to use redundant paging VIOS partitions, or 2 if the partition is to use redundant paging VIOS partitions if possible.

This option is only valid when listing shared memory pool information. If this option is not specified when listing shared memory pool information, then the partition is required to use the same paging  VIOS  redundancy configuration  on  the  destination  managed  system  that  the  partition  is currently using on the source managed system.

The --redundantvios and --redundantpgvios options  are  equivalent.  The --redundantpgvios option is deprecated.

## --redundantvnicbkdev

When listing  virtual  I/O  information,  use  this  option  to  specify  the  backing  device  redundancy requirement of the partition's virtual NICs on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the virtual NIC backing device redundancy is required to be maintained, or 2 if the virtual NIC backing  device  redundancy is to be maintained  if  possible. If  this  option  is  not  specified,  this option defaults to the value 1 .

If this option has a value of 1 , the HMC must map every virtual NIC backing device to a virtual NIC backing device on the destination managed system. In addition, the HMC must maintain the VIOS redundancy the backing devices for a virtual  NIC  provide.  For  example,  if  two backing devices for a virtual NIC are hosted by two different VIOSs on the source managed system, then the backing devices for that virtual NIC must be hosted by two different VIOSs on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when listing virtual I/O information.

## NAME

lslparutil - list utilization data

## SYNOPSIS

To list utilization data collected for a managed system:

```
lslparutil -r { hmc | lpar | pool | procpool | mempool | sys | all } -m managed-system [ -d number-of-days ] [ -h number-of-hours ] [ --minutes number-of-minutes ] [ --startyear year ] [ --startmonth month ] [ --startday day ] [ --starthour hour ] [ --startminute minute ] [ --endyear year ] [ --endmonth month ] [ --endday day ] [ --endhour hour ] [ --endminute minute ] [ -n number-of-events ] [ -s sample-rate ] [ --filter " filter-data " ] [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ] To list HMC settings for utilization data collection: lslparutil -r config [ -m managed-system ] [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

lslparutil lists utilization data collected for a managed-system . This command also lists the Hardware Management Console (HMC) settings for utilization data collection.

The HMC collects the following types of utilization data: sampling events, state change events, configuration change events, and Utility Capacity on Demand (CoD) processor usage events.

Sampling events are collected for the managed system, for each partition in the managed system, and for the physical processor pool, each shared processor pool, and the shared memory pool in the managed system.  Sampling ev  ents are collected at the configured sample rate. They are also collected hourly, daily at midnight,  and  monthly  at  midnight  on  the  first  day  of  each  month. Sampling  events  are  also  collected immediately  following  the  collection  of  a  Utility  CoD  processor  usage  event. Sampling ev  ents  contain information about memory and processor utilization.

State change events are collected for the managed system, for each partition in the managed system, and for the HMC. State change events are collected when a state change occurs for the managed system, a partition, or when the HMC is started or shut down.

Configuration change events are collected for the managed system, for each partition in the managed system, for each shared processor pool in the managed system, for the shared memory pool in the managed system, and for the HMC. Configuration change events are collected when a configuration change affecting memory or processor resources occurs for the managed system, a partition, a shared processor pool, or the shared memory pool. Configuration change events are also collected when the local time is changed on the HMC.

Utility  CoD processor usage events are collected for the managed system when a Utility CoD processor minute is used. All Utility CoD processor minutes used during a single minute are grouped into one event.

Hourly sampling events and all state change, configuration change, and Utility CoD processor usage events collected are only saved on the HMC for about 2 months. Daily sampling events are saved for about 2 years, and monthly sampling events are saved for about 10 years.

Sampling events are also saved in a snapshot file. Sampling events that are collected more frequently than

hourly are only saved in the snapshot file. All state change, configuration change, and Utility CoD processor usage events collected are also saved in the snapshot file, in addition to being saved with the hourly sampling events.  The snapshot file is purged daily at midnight. Events more than 24 hours old are purged. Therefore, the snapshot file will only contain events that were collected during the last 24 to 48 hours.

Utilization data collection for managed systems is not automatically enabled. The chlparutil command can be used to enable utilization data collection and configure the sample rate.

lsmemdev - list memory devices

## SYNOPSIS

lsmemdev -r avail -m managed-system

[ --min minimum-size ] [ --max maximum-size ] [ --filter " filter-data " ]

{ -p partition-names | --id partition-IDs } [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

lsmemdev lists block storage devices that can be used as reserved storage devices for the managed-system . Reserved storage devices are used as paging space devices for partitions that use shared memory. Reserved storage devices are also used for suspended partitions.

Block storage devices can be listed for any Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partition in the managed system. However, a device cannot be added to a pool unless the VIOS partition is assigned to that pool.

On a managed system that supports  partition  suspend  and  resume  operations,  block  storage  devices  are added to the reserved storage device pool. On a managed system that supports Active Memory Sharing but does not support partition suspend and resume operations, block storage devices are added to the shared memory pool.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of resources to list. The only valid value is av  ail to list the block storage devices that are available to add to a reserved storage device pool or a shared memory pool. Any device that is already in a pool will not be listed.
- -m The name of the managed system which has the VIOS partition(s) for which to list block storage devices.  The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -p The name of one or two VIOS partitions for which to list block storage devices.  The partition(s) must be in the running state  and  must  have  an RMC  connection  to  the  Hardware  Management Console (HMC).

If two VIOS partitions are specified, then only those block storage devices that can be accessed by both VIOS partitions are listed. The two partition names must be comma separated.

You can  either  use  this  option  to  specify  the  name(s)  of  the  VIOS  partition(s),  or  use  the --id option to specify the ID(s). The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of one or two VIOS partitions for which to list block storage devices.  The partition(s) must be in the running state and must have an RMC connection to the HMC.

If two VIOS partitions are specified, then only those block storage devices that can be accessed by both VIOS partitions are listed. The two partition IDs must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the ID(s) of the VIOS partition(s), or use the -p option to specify the name(s). The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

- --min The minimum size, in megabytes, of the block storage devices to list. If this option is not specified, a default value of 0 is used.
- --max The maximum size, in megabytes, of the block storage devices to list. If this option is not specified, no maximum size is used.
- --filter The filter(s)  to  apply  to  the  block  storage  devices  to  be  listed. Filters  are  used  to  select  which devices are to be listed. If no filters are used, then all of the devices will be listed. For example,

only physical devices can be listed by using the types filter.

The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

" filter-name = value , filter-name = value , ... "

Note that certain filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

"" filter-name = value , value , ... ", ... "

When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Only one value can be specified for each filter.

Valid filter names for this command:

## redundant

Valid values are:

- 0 - devices which could never be accessed by another VIOS partition
- 1 - devices which possibly could be accessed by another VIOS partition

## types

Valid values are:

logical - logical devices

phys - physical devices

- -F A delimiter separated list  of  attribute  names  for  the  desired  attribute  values  to  be  displayed  for each device.  If no attribute names are specified, then values for all of the attributes for each device will be displayed.

When this option is specified, only attribute values will be displayed. No attribute names will be displayed.  The attribute values displayed will be separated by the delimiter which was specified with this option.

This option is useful when only attribute values are desired to be displayed, or when the values of only selected attributes are desired to be displayed.

## --header

Display a header record, which is a delimiter separated list of attribute names for the attribute values that will be displayed. This header record will be the first record displayed. This option is only valid when used with the -F option.

--help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## NAME

lsmemopt - list memory optimization information

## SYNOPSIS

```
lsmemopt -m managed-system [ -r { sys | lpar }] [ -o { currscore | calcscore }] [ -p partition-names | --id partition-IDs ] [ -x partition-names | --xid partition-IDs ] [ --filter " filter-data " ] [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

lsmemopt lists information, including status and progress information, about the most recent memory optimization operation that was started on the managed-system .

lsmemopt also lists affinity scores for the managed-system and for partitions in the managed-system . An affinity score is a measure of how good the processor-memory affinity is on the managed system or for a partition. The score is a number between 0 and 100, with 0 representing the worst affinity and 100 representing perfect affinity. Depending on the system configuration, scores of 100 might not be attainable. A partition with no processor and memory resources does not have an affinity score, and none will be displayed for its score.

lsmemopt can list current affinity scores, and can calculate and list potential affinity scores which could be attained after running a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation. Note that potential affinity scores may differ slightly from the actual affinity scores that are attained after running the Dynamic Platform Optimization operation.

## OPTIONS -m

The name of the managed system for which to list memory optimization information. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

- -r The type of resources for which to list affinity scores. Valid values are sys to list the affinity score for the managed system, and lpar to list affinity scores for partitions.

If this option is omitted when listing affinity scores, the affinity score for the managed system will be listed.

This option is only valid when listing affinity scores.

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are currscore to list current affinity scores, and calcscore to calculate and list potential affinity scores.

If  this  option  is  omitted,  information about the most recent memory optimization operation that was started on the managed system is listed.

- -p The name of one or more potential partitions to prioritize for optimization. This list of partitions is used to calculate the potential affinity scores that could be attained if a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation that prioritized this list of partitions were run.

Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the names of the potential partitions to prioritize for optimization, or use the --id option to specify the IDs of the partitions. The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the --id option is used to specify a list of potential partitions to prioritize for  optimization,  the  managed  system  will  use  its  own  prioritization. In  either  case,  the  list  of potential partitions to optimize defaults to all partitions except those that are specified in the list of potential partitions to exclude from the operation.

This option is only valid when -o calcscore is specified.

- --id The ID of one or more potential partitions to prioritize for optimization. This list of partitions is used to calculate the potential affinity scores that could be attained if a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation that prioritizes this list of partitions were run.

A range of partition IDs may be specified. A range is specified by specifying the beginning partition  ID,  a  dash,  and  the  ending  partition  ID. Both  the  beginning  and  ending  partition  IDs  are included in the range. For example, the range 1-5 includes partitions IDs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

The list of partition IDs specified with this option must be comma separated and can include one or more partition IDs, one or more ranges of partition IDs, or both.

You can either use this option to specify the IDs of the potential partitions to prioritize for optimization, or use the -p option to specify the names of the partitions. The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the -p option is used to specify a list of potential partitions to prioritize for  optimization,  the  managed  system  will  use  its  own  prioritization. In  either  case,  the  list  of potential partitions to optimize defaults to all partitions except those that are specified in the list of potential partitions to exclude from the operation.

This option is only valid when -o calcscore is specified.

- -x The name of one or more potential partitions to exclude and protect from an optimization operation.  This list of partitions is used to calculate the potential affinity scores that could be attained if a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation were run with this list of partitions to exclude.

Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the names of the potential partitions to exclude, or use the --xid option to specify the IDs of the partitions. The -x and the --xid options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the --xid option is used to specify a list of potential partitions to exclude, the list of potential partitions to exclude defaults to an empty list.

This option is only valid when -o calcscore is specified.

- --xid The ID of one or more potential partitions to exclude and protect from an optimization operation. This list of partitions is used to calculate the potential affinity scores that could be attained if a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation were run with this list of partitions to exclude.

A range of partition IDs may be specified. A range is specified by specifying the beginning partition  ID,  a  dash,  and  the  ending  partition  ID. Both  the  beginning  and  ending  partition  IDs  are included in the range. For example, the range 8-11 includes partitions IDs 8, 9, 10, and 11.

The list of partition IDs specified with this option must be comma separated and can include one or more partition IDs, one or more ranges of partition IDs, or both.

You can either use this option to specify the IDs of the potential partitions to exclude, or use the -x

option to specify the names of the partitions. The --xid and the -x options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the -x option is used to specify a list of potential partitions to exclude, the list of potential partitions to exclude defaults to an empty list.

This option is only valid when -o calcscore is specified.

- --filter The filter to apply to the partition affinity scores to list. The filter is used to select which partitions to list. If a filter is not specified, then all partitions will be listed.

The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

" filter-name = value "

Note that the filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

"" filter-name = value , value , ... ""

When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Multiple values can be specified for each filter.

Valid filter names:

lpar\_names | lpar\_ids

This option is only valid when listing partition affinity scores.

- -F A delimiter separated list of attribute names for the desired attribute values to be displayed. If no attribute names are specified, then values for all of the attributes will be displayed.

When this option is specified, only attribute values will be displayed. No attribute names will be displayed.  The attribute values displayed will be separated by the delimiter which was specified with this option.

This option is useful when only attribute values are desired to be displayed, or when the values of only selected attributes are desired to be displayed.

## --header

Display a header record, which is a delimiter separated list of attribute names for the attribute values that will be displayed. This header record will be the first record displayed. This option is only valid when used with the -F option.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

List information about the last memory optimization operation that was started:

## lsmemopt -m system1

List just the status of the last memory optimization operation that was started:

lsmemopt -m 8233-E8B*1234321 -F status

List the current system affinity score:

## lsmemopt -m sys -o currscore

List the current affinity scores for all partitions in the managed system:

## lsmemopt -m sys -o currscore -r lpar

List the current affinity scores for partitions lp2 and lp3 only:

## lsmemopt -m sys -o currscore -r lpar --filter ""lpar\_names=lp2,lp3""

Calculate and list the potential system affinity score that could be attained if a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation were run to optimize all partitions in the system:

## lsmemopt -m sys -o calcscore

Calculate and list the potential partition affinity scores that could be attained if a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation that prioritizes partitions lp1 and lp3 were run:

## lsmemopt -m sys -o calcscore -r lpar -p lp1,lp3

Calculate and list the potential system affinity score that could be attained if a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation that prioritizes the partitions with IDs 2 , 4 , 6 through 9 , and 11 , and excludes the partition with ID 1 , were run:

If this option is omitted, only the current reference code will be listed.

- --filter The filter to apply to the partition reference codes to be listed. A filter is used to select the partitions for which reference codes are to be listed. If no filter is specified, then reference codes for all partitions in the managed-system will be listed.

The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

filter-name = value , filter-name = value , ...&lt;LF&gt;

Note that certain filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" filter-name = value , value , ... ", ...&lt;LF&gt;

When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Valid filter names for this command are lpar\_names or lpar\_ids . Only one of these filters may be specified.  Multiple partitions can be specified with the filter.

This option is not valid when listing managed system reference codes.

- -F A delimiter separated list  of  attribute  names  for  the  desired  attribute  values  to  be  displayed  for each reference code. If no attribute names are specified, then values for all of the reference code attributes will be displayed.

When this option is specified, only attribute values will be displayed. No attribute names will be displayed.  The attribute values displayed will be separated by the delimiter which was specified with this option.

This option is useful when only attribute values are desired to be displayed, or when the values of only selected attributes are desired to be displayed.

```

## DESCRIPTION

lsrrstartlpar lists partition remote restart information.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of resources for which to list partition remote restart information.

Specify lpar to list partition remote restart information for all of the partitions in managed-system .

Specify lparcfg to list the partition configuration information saved in the remote restart data for all of the partitions in managed-system that are simplified remote restart capable.

Specify mc to  list  partition  remote  restart  capabilities  for  the  Hardware  Management  Console (HMC).

Specify mem to list the memory requirements, including persistent memory requirements, for the partition specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter, and also list the available memory on the destination managed system.

Specify sriov to list possible and suggested mappings of the migratable SR-IOV logical ports in the partition specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter.

Specify sys to list partition remote restart capabilities for managed-system .

Specify virtualio to  list  possible  and  suggested  mappings  of  the  virtual  Fibre  Channel  (FC) adapters, virtual SCSI adapters, and virtual NICs in the partition specified with the lpar\_names or lpar\_ids filter. Note that possible and suggested mappings of virtual FC adapters can be listed for shutdown partitions only.

- -m The name of the managed system for which to list partition remote restart information. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

When listing virtual I/O information, specify the source managed system for the partition remote restart operation with this option.

This option is not valid when listing partition remote restart information for the HMC. This option is required when listing all other types of partition remote restart information.

- -t The name of the target, or destination, managed system for the partition remote restart operation. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed

systems with the same user-defined name.

This option is required when listing virtual I/O information. This option is not valid when listing any other type of partition remote restart information.

- --ip If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, then use this option to specify the IP address or host name of the management console that is managing the destination managed system.

To  use this option, SSH must be enabled on both management consoles. Also, you must run the mkauthkeys command once to set up SSH key authentication.

- -u If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, then use this option to specify the user ID to use on the management console that is managing the destination managed system. If you do not specify the user ID, then the user ID of the user that issues this command will be used.

## --redundantsriovadapters

When listing migratable SR-IOV logical port information, use this option to specify the SR-IOV adapter redundancy requirement of the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports on the destination managed system. When listing virtual I/O information, use this option to specify the SR-IOV adapter redundancy requirement of the partition's virtual NIC backing devices on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if SR-IOV adapter redundancy is required to be maintained, or 2 if SR-IOV adapter redundancy is to be maintained if possible. If this option is not specified, this option defaults to the value 2 .

If  this  option  has  a  value  of 1 , the  HMC must maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy when mapping the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports or virtual NIC backing devices to the destination managed system. For example, if two migratable SR-IOV logical ports or two virtual NIC backing devices are on the same SR-IOV adapter on the source managed system, they must be mapped to the same SR-IOV adapter on the destination managed system. If two migratable SRIOV logical  ports  or  two virtual  NIC  backing  devices  are  on  different  SR-IOV adapters  on  the source  managed  system,  they must  be  mapped  to  different  SR-IOV adapters  on  the  destination managed system.

This option is only valid when listing migratable SR-IOV logical port information or virtual I/O information.

## --redundantvnicbkdev

When listing  virtual  I/O  information,  use  this  option  to  specify  the  backing  device  redundancy requirement of the partition's virtual NICs on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the virtual NIC backing device redundancy is required to be maintained, or 2 if the virtual NIC backing  device  redundancy is to be maintained  if  possible. If  this  option  is  not  specified,  this option defaults to the value 1 .

If this option has a value of 1 , the HMC must map every virtual NIC backing device to a virtual NIC backing device on the destination managed system. In addition, the HMC must maintain the VIOS redundancy the backing devices for a virtual  NIC  provide.  For  example,  if  two backing devices for a virtual NIC are hosted by two different VIOSs on the source managed system, then the backing devices for that virtual NIC must be hosted by two different VIOSs on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when listing virtual I/O information.

## --sriovlogportcfg

When listing migratable SR-IOV logical port information, use this option to specify the configuration requirements for the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports on the destination managed

system.  Valid values are 1 if  the migratable SR-IOV logical port configuration is required to be maintained, or 2 if the migratable SR-IOV logical port configuration is to be maintained if possible.  If this option is not specified, this option defaults to the value 1 .

Specifying a value of 2 for this option will allow the HMC to map the partition's migratable SRIOV logical  ports  to  SR-IOV logical  ports  with  different  port  VLAN  ID,  allowed  VLAN  IDs, allowed MAC addresses or capacity configurations on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when listing migratable SR-IOV logical port information.

## --vniccfg

When listing virtual I/O information, use this option to specify the configuration requirements for the partition's virtual NICs on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if  the  virtual NIC configuration is required to be maintained, or 2 if the virtual NIC configuration is to be maintained if possible. If this option is not specified, this option defaults to the value 1 .

Specifying a value of 2 for this option will allow the HMC to map the partition's virtual NICs to virtual NICs with different allowed VLAN IDs or maximum capacity configurations on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when listing virtual I/O information.

## --viosfcportlabel

When listing virtual I/O information, use this option to specify whether VIOS FC port labels are to be used when determining mappings of virtual FC adapters. Valid values are 1 if VIOS FC port labels are required to be used, or 2 if VIOS FC port labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS FC port label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

This option is only valid when listing virtual I/O information.

## --viosstoragelabel

When listing virtual I/O information, use this option to specify whether VIOS virtual FC and virtual SCSI group labels are to be used when determining mappings of virtual FC and virtual SCSI adapters.  Valid values are 1 if VIOS virtual FC and virtual SCSI group labels are required to be used,  or 2 if  VIOS  virtual  FC  and  virtual  SCSI  group  labels  are  to  be  used  if  possible. If  this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS storage group label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

This option is only valid when listing virtual I/O information.

## --viosvniclabel

When listing virtual I/O information, use this option to specify whether VIOS virtual NIC group labels are to be used when determining mappings of virtual NICs. Valid values are 1 if VIOS virtual NIC group labels are required to be used, or 2 if VIOS virtual NIC group labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS virtual NIC group label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

This option is only valid when listing virtual I/O information.

- --filter The filter(s) to apply to the resources to be listed. Filters are used to select which resources are to be  listed. If  no  filters  are  used,  then  all  of  the  resources  will  be  listed. For example, partition information can be listed by using a filter to specify the names or IDs of the partitions to list. Otherwise, if no filter is used, then information for all of the partitions in the managed system will be listed.

The  filter  data  consists  of  filter  name/value  pairs,  which  are  in  comma  separated  value  (CSV)

format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

" filter-name = value "

Note that the filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

"" filter-name = value , value , ... ""

When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Valid filter names:

## lpar\_names | lpar\_ids

One of these filters is required when listing memory or virtual I/O information, or mappings of migratable SR-IOV logical ports, and only one partition can be specified.  These filters are optional when listing partition information or partition configuration information, and if specified, multiple partitions can be specified.

This option is not valid when listing HMC or managed system information.

- -F A delimiter separated list of attribute names for the desired attribute values to be displayed. If no attribute names are specified, then values for all of the attributes will be displayed.

When this option is specified, only attribute values will be displayed. No attribute names will be displayed.  The attribute values displayed will be separated by the delimiter which was specified with this option.

This option is useful when only attribute values are desired to be displayed, or when the values of only selected attributes are desired to be displayed.

Descriptions of selected command attributes:

## pmem\_volumes

A comma separated list of persistent memory volumes assigned to a partition. Each persistent memory volume has the following format:

name / size / affinity / UUID / type

## --header

Display a header record, which is a delimiter separated list of attribute names for the attribute values that will be displayed. This header record will be the first record displayed. This option is only valid when used with the -F option.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## DESCRIPTION

lssvcevents lists  console  events  logged  by  the  Hardware  Management  Console  (HMC),  or  serviceable ev  ents.

## OPTIONS

- -t The type of events to list. Valid values are console for console events, or hardware for serviceable events.
- -d The number of days prior to today for which events will be listed. Events that occurred today will be listed, along with any events that occurred during the past number-of-days days.

If this option is omitted when listing console events, console events that occurred within the past 7 days will be listed.

If  both this option and the -n option are omitted when listing serviceable events, all serviceable ev  ents will be listed.

- -i The number of minutes to go back and search for events.  This search is based on the time that the ev  ent was initially created on the HMC, and is not affected by later updates to the event.
- -m The name of the managed system for which serviceable events are to be listed. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form  must  be  used  if  there  are  multiple  managed  systems  with  the same user-defined name.

If both this option and the -n option are omitted, all serviceable events will be listed.

This option is only valid when listing serviceable events.

- -n The maximum number of serviceable events to list.

This option is only valid when listing serviceable events.

- --filter The filter to apply to the serviceable events to be listed. A filter is used to select which serviceable ev  ents are to be listed. For example, only open serviceable events can be listed by using a filter to specify the status (open) of the serviceable events to list. If a filter is not used, then all serviceable ev  ents will be listed.

The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

" filter-name = value , filter-name = value , ... "

Note that certain filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

## DESCRIPTION

lssyscfg lists the attributes of partitions, partition profiles, or system profiles for the managed-system . It can also list the attributes of the managed-system , and of all of the systems managed by this Hardware Management Console (HMC).

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of resources to list. Valid values are lpar for partitions, prof for partition profiles, sys for managed systems, and sysprof for system profiles.
- -m The  name  of  either  the  managed  system  to  list,  or  the  managed  system  which  has  the  system resources to list. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is  the  machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

This option is required when listing partitions, partition profiles, or system profiles. This option is optional when listing managed systems, and if it is omitted, then all of the systems managed by this HMC will be listed.

## --osrefresh

When listing partitions, specify this option to refresh the current operating system version information for the partitions first. If a partition does not have an active RMC connection to the management console, Unknown will be displayed for that partition's operating system version information.

Specifying this option may cause this command to take a long time to complete if many partitions are being listed or there are network issues.

This option is only valid when listing partitions.

## --lastvalidcfg

When listing partition profiles, specify this option to include the last valid configuration partition profiles.

This option is only valid when listing partition profiles.

- --filter The filter(s) to apply to the resources to be listed. Filters are used to select which resources of the specified resource type are to be listed. If no filters are used, then all of the resources of the specified resource type will be listed. For example, specific partitions can be listed by using a filter to specify the names or IDs of the partitions to list. Otherwise, if no filter is used, then all of the partitions in the managed system will be listed.

The filter data consists of filter name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.  The filter data must be enclosed in double quotes.

The format of the filter data is as follows:

" filter-name = value , filter-name = value , ... "

Note that certain filters accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

"" filter-name = value , value , ... ", ... "

When a list of values is specified, the filter name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Multiple values can be specified for each filter.

Valid filter names for partitions:

```
lpar_names | lpar_ids | work_groups
```

Only one of these three filters may be specified.

Valid filter names for partition profiles:

```
lpar_names | lpar_ids , profile_names
```

Valid filter names for system profiles:

## profile\_names

This option is not valid when listing managed systems.

- -F A delimiter separated list  of  attribute  names  for  the  desired  attribute  values  to  be  displayed  for each  resource. If  no  attribute  names  are  specified,  then  values  for  all  of  the  attributes  for  the resource will be displayed.

When this option is specified, only attribute values will be displayed. No attribute names will be displayed.  The attribute values displayed will be separated by the delimiter which was specified with this option.

This option is useful when only attribute values are desired to be displayed, or when the values of only selected attributes are desired to be displayed.

To display the values of only selected properties of the sriov\_eth\_logical\_ports or vnic\_adapters partition profile attributes, use the following format:

attribute-name = property-name : property-name : ...

If no property names are specified, then values for all of the properties for each attribute will be displayed.

Descriptions of selected command attributes:

## capabilities

A comma separated list of managed system capabilities. Capabilities that are supported by the managed system are displayed in the list. Capabilities that are not supported are not displayed.

## uptime

The amount of time the managed system or partition has been running since its last restart. The format of this field is:

days hours : minutes

## --header

Display a header record, which is a delimiter separated list of attribute names for the attribute values that will be displayed. This header record will be the first record displayed. This option is only valid when used with the -F option.

--help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## NAME

lssysconn - list system connections

## SYNOPSIS

To list connection information for all managed systems:

lssysconn -r all [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ]

To  list all IP addresses that cannot be automatically discovered when using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):

lssysconn -r nondiscover [ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]]

[ --help

]

To  list Virtualization Management Interface (VMI) network interface information for an Enterprise Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) based managed system:

lssysconn -r vmi -m managed-system

[ -F [ attribute-names ] [ --header ]] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

lssysconn lists connection information for all of the systems managed by this Hardware Management Console (HMC). Connection information for all systems to which this HMC is connected or attempting to connect is listed.

lssysconn also lists IP addresses that cannot be automatically discovered by this HMC when using DHCP. If this HMC is set up as a DHCP server on a private network, whenever the Remove Connection task or the rmsysconn command  is  run  to  remove  a  managed  system  from  the  HMC,  the  HMC  places  the  IP address(es) of that system in a list of removed IP addresses.  Any IP address in that list will not be rediscovered when reattached to the HMC. The lssysconn -r nondiscover command can be used to display the contents of that list of removed IP addresses.

lssysconn also lists VMI network interface information for an Enterprise BMC-based managed system.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of resources for which to list connection information. Valid values are all for all managed systems, nondiscover for  all  IP  addresses  that  cannot  be  automatically  discovered  by  this HMC when using DHCP, and vmi for VMI network interface information for an Enterprise BMCbased managed system.
- -m The name of the Enterprise BMC-based managed system for which to list VMI network interface information.

migrdbg - partition migration debug tools

## SYNOPSIS

To enable or disable automatic partition migration failure debug data collection:

migrdbg -o { e | d } [ --help ]

To manually collect partition migration debug data:

migrdbg -o c [ -m managed-system ] [ -t target-managed-system ]

[ -p partition-names | --id partition-IDs ]

[ --tp target-partition-names | --tid target-partition-IDs ]

[ --help ]

To remove a partition migration debug data package: migrdbg -o r { -f file | --all } [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

migrdbg provides partition migration debug tools.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform.

Specify e to  enable  automatic  collection  of  partition  migration  debug  data  on  this  management console.  When enabled, debug data will be collected automatically for every partition migration that fails on this management console. If you are performing partition migrations to destination managed systems that are managed by other management consoles, you should enable automatic collection of partition migration debug data on those other management consoles also.

Specify d to  disable automatic collection of partition migration debug data on this management console.

Specify c to manually collect partition migration debug data on this management console after a partition migration failure occurs when automatic collection of partition migration debug data on this  management console is not enabled. It  is  recommended that you collect the debug data as close to the partition migration failure as possible. Performing another operation that affects the same source or destination managed system may cause the partition migration debug data for that managed  system  to  be  overwritten. If you  perform  multiple  partition  migrations  with  a  single migrlpar command, it is recommended that you use automatic collection of partition migration debug data, since only debug data for the most recent partition migration is likely to be available after the migrlpar command completes. If a failed partition migration was performed using different source and destination management consoles, you should collect partition migration debug data on both management consoles.

Specify r to remove a partition migration debug data package from this management console.

- -m The name of the source managed system for the partition migration for which you want to collect debug data. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

If the source managed system is not managed by this management console, the debug data must be collected from the management console that manages the source managed system.

- -t The name of the target, or destination, managed system for the partition migration for which you want to collect debug data. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is  the machine type, mmm is  the model, and

sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

If  the  destination  managed system is not managed by this management console, the debug data must be collected from the management console that manages the destination managed system.

- -p The name of one or more Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partitions on the source managed system from which to collect partition migration debug data. Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the names of the VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, or use the --id option to specify the IDs of the partitions. The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the --id option is used to specify a list of VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, partition migration debug data will be collected from all of the VIOS partitions on the source managed system.

- -id The ID of one or more VIOS partitions on the source managed system from which to collect partition migration debug data. Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the IDs of the VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, or use the -p option to specify the names of the partitions. The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the -p option is used to specify a list of VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, partition migration debug data will be collected from all of the VIOS partitions on the source managed system.

- --tp The  name  of  one  or  more  VIOS  partitions  on  the  target,  or  destination,  managed  system  from which to collect partition migration debug data. Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the names of the VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, or use the --tid option to specify the IDs of the partitions. The --tp and the --tid options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the --tid option is used to specify a list of VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, partition migration debug data will be collected from all of the VIOS partitions on the destination managed system.

- --tid The ID of one or more VIOS partitions on the target, or destination, managed system from which to collect partition migration debug data. Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the IDs of the VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, or use the --tp option to specify the names of the partitions. The --tid and the --tp options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the --tp option is used to specify a list of VIOS partitions from which to collect partition migration debug data, partition migration debug data will be collected from all of the VIOS partitions on the destination managed system.

- -f The file name of the partition migration debug data package to remove from this management console.
- --all Specify this option to remove all partition migration debug data packages from this management console.

--help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Enable automatic partition migration failure debug data collection on this management console:

## DESCRIPTION

migrlpar performs partition migration operations.

Partition migration operations can be performed for AIX, Linux, or IBM i partitions only.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are m to validate then migrate one or more partitions if validation succeeds, r to recover from a failed partition migration, s to stop a partition migration, v to validate one or more partition migrations, and set to set attributes related to partition migration operations.

A recover operation should be issued, if possible, on the management console that is managing the source managed system.

A stop operation must be issued on the management console that is managing the source managed system.

- -m The name of the source managed system for the partition migration operation. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is  the  machine  type, mmm is  the  model,  and sssssss is  the  serial  number  of  the  managed

system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

If this option is not specified for a system set operation, then the set operation will be performed for all systems that are currently managed by this Hardware Management Console (HMC).

- -t The name of the target, or destination, managed system for the partition migration operation. The name  may  either  be  the  user-defined  name  for  the  managed  system,  or  be  in  the  form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

This option is required when migrating partitions or validating partition migrations. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- --ip If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, then use this option to specify the IP address or host name of the management console that is managing the destination managed system.

SSH must be enabled on both management consoles. Also, you must run the mkauthkeys command once to set up SSH key authentication.

This option is  required  when  migrating  partitions,  validating  partition  migrations,  or  recovering from a failed partition migration if the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- -u If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, then use this option to specify the user ID to use on the management console that is managing the destination managed system. If you do not specify the user ID, then the user ID of the user that issues this command will be used.
- -p The name of the partition for which to perform the operation.

One or more partition names can be specified When migrating partitions or validating partition migrations.  When performing any other operation, only a single partition name can be specified.

Multiple  partition  names  must  be  comma  separated. The maximum number of partition names that  can  be  specified  is  displayed  by  the lslparmigr  -r  mc  -F  max\_lpars\_per\_migrlpar\_cmd command.

The -p , --id , and --all options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the partition for which to perform the operation.

One  or  more  partition  IDs  can  be  specified  When  migrating  partitions  or  validating  partition migrations.  When performing any other operation, only a single partition ID can be specified.

Multiple partition IDs must be comma separated. The maximum number of partition IDs that can be specified is displayed by the lslparmigr -r mc -F max\_lpars\_per\_migrlpar\_cmd command.

The --id , -p , and --all options are mutually exclusive.

- --all Specify this option to perform the operation for all AIX, Linux, and IBM i partitions.

This option is only valid when migrating partitions or stopping partition migration operations.

The --all , -p , and --id options are mutually exclusive.

- -n The name of the partition profile to create for the migrated partition on the destination managed system.  If this option is omitted when migrating a partition, then the last activated profile for the partition will be replaced with the current partition configuration on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when migrating a single partition or validating a single partition migration.  When migrating more than one partition or validating more than one partition migration, the multiple\_profile\_names attribute must be specified instead.

## --redundantvios , --redundantpgvios

When validating or migrating partitions that use shared memory, use this option to specify whether the partitions are to be configured to use redundant paging VIOS partitions on the destination managed system.

When validating or migrating suspended partitions, use this option to specify whether the partitions are to be configured to use redundant VIOS partitions on the destination managed system for accessing the devices that contain the data needed to resume the suspended partitions.

When validating or migrating remote restart capable partitions, use this option to specify whether the partitions are to be configured to use redundant VIOS partitions on the destination managed system for accessing the devices that contain the data needed to perform remote restarts of the partitions.

Valid values are 0 if the partitions are to be configured to not use redundant VIOS partitions, 1 if the partitions are to be configured to use redundant VIOS partitions, or 2 if the partitions are to be configured to use redundant VIOS partitions if possible. If this option is not specified, then each partition  will  be  configured  to  use  the  same  VIOS  redundancy configuration  on  the  destination managed system that the partition is currently using on the source managed system.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions that use shared memory, partitions  that  are  suspended,  or  partitions  that  are  remote  restart  capable. This  option  is  not  valid when performing any other operation.

The --redundantvios and --redundantpgvios options  are  equivalent.  The --redundantpgvios option is deprecated.

- --mpio When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain an equivalent multipath I/O (MPIO) configuration of each partition's virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapters on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain an equivalent MPIO configuration, or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain an equivalent MPIO configuration, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If  this  option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot guarantee that an equivalent MPIO configuration of all of a partition's virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapters can be maintained on the destination managed system, then an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --vlanbridge

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether each partition's virtual ethernet adapters are required to be configured so that they are bridged on the same VLAN to an external  network  on  the  destination  managed  system. Valid  values  are 1 if  virtual  ethernet adapters are required to be bridged, or 2 if virtual ethernet adapters are not required to be bridged,

but should be bridged if possible. If  this  option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If this option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot guarantee that a partition's virtual ethernet adapters can be bridged, then an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

A value of 2 cannot be specified  with  this  option  when  a  value  of 1 is  specified  with  the --vsi option.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- --vsi When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether each partition's virtual ethernet adapter Virtual Station Interface (VSI) profiles are required to be configured on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if  VSI profiles are required to be configured, or 2 if VSI profiles are not required to be configured, but should be configured if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value of the --vlanbridge option.

If this option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot configure a partition's VSI profiles on the destination managed system, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

A value of 1 cannot be specified with this option when a value of 2 is specified with the --vlanbridge option.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --npivval

When validating partition migrations, use this option to specify the type of validation to be performed for each migrating partition's NPIV devices.  Valid values are port to perform port validation only, or portdisk to perform both port and disk validation.  If this option is not specified, only port validation will be performed unless disk validation for partition migrations has been enabled directly on the Virtual I/O Servers.

This option is only valid when validating partition migrations. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- --uuid Use this option to allow partitions to be migrated to a destination managed system that is managed by a management console at Version 7 Release 7.7 or earlier. These releases do not support partition universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).

Normally, a partition's UUID is transferred to the destination managed system during a migration operation.  However, older management consoles do not support partition UUIDs and the migration operation will fail.  Specifying a value of 2 with this option will allow the migration operation to proceed, and the UUIDs of all of the migrating partitions will be lost. Note that the loss of a partition's UUID can cause higher level management software to lose the ability to track the location of the partition.

Valid values for this option are 1 if partition UUIDs are required to be migrated, or 2 if partition UUIDs are not required to be migrated, but should be migrated if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value 1 .

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --protectstorage

Use this option to allow suspended partitions to be migrated.

After a suspended partition has been migrated to another managed system, it is exposed to accidental reassignment of its virtual storage devices while it remains suspended. Since there is no way to prevent  this  exposure,  it  is  recommended  that  a  suspended  partition  be  resumed  before being migrated.

Valid values for this option are 1 if each suspended partition's virtual storage devices are required to  be  protected,  or 2 if  each  suspended partition's virtual storage devices are not required to be protected.  If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 . To migrate suspended  partitions,  you  must  specify  a  value  of 2 and  assume  responsibility  for  ensuring  the integrity of each suspended partition's virtual storage devices.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --requirerr

When  validating  or  migrating  partitions,  use  this  option  to  specify  whether  each  partition  is required to be capable of simplified remote restart on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if each partition is required to be capable of simplified remote restart on the destination managed system, or 2 if each partition is not required to be capable of simplified remote restart on the destination managed system but should be if possible.

If this option has a value of 1 and the simplified remote restart capability of a migrating partition cannot be enabled on the destination managed system, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition. If this option has a value of 2 and the simplified remote restart capability of a migrating partition cannot be enabled on the destination managed system, the operation will not fail for that partition, even if that partition was capable of simplified remote restart on the source managed system. If this option is not specified, each partition's simplified remote restart capability on the source managed system will be maintained on the destination managed system. If that is not possible for a partition, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --redundantmsps

When validating or migrating active partitions, use this option to specify whether redundant MSPs are to be used. Valid values are 0 if redundant MSPs are not to be used, 1 if redundant MSPs are required to be used, or 2 if redundant MSPs are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to 2 .

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --redundantsriovadapters

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy of each partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports and virtual NIC backing devices on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy,  or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 2 .

If  this  option  has  a  value  of 1 , the  management  console  must  be  able  to  maintain  the  SR-IOV adapter redundancy of all of the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports and virtual NIC backing devices on the destination managed system. For example, if two migratable SR-IOV logical

ports or two virtual NIC backing devices are on the same SR-IOV adapter on the source managed system, they must be configured on the same SR-IOV adapter on the destination managed system. If two migratable SR-IOV logical ports or two virtual NIC backing devices are on different SRIOV adapters  on  the  source  managed  system,  they must  be  configured  on  different  SR-IOV adapters on the destination managed system. If the management console is not able to do this for all of a partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports and virtual NIC backing devices, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --redundantvnicbkdev

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the backing device redundancy of each partition's virtual NICs on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain the  virtual  NIC  backing  device  redundancy,  or 2 if  the  management  console  is  not  required  to maintain the virtual NIC backing device redundancy, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If  this  option  has a value of 1 , the management console must be able to map every virtual NIC backing device to a virtual NIC backing device on the destination managed system. In addition, the management console must be able to maintain the VIOS redundancy the backing devices for a virtual NIC provide.  For example, if two backing devices for a virtual NIC are hosted by two different VIOSs on the source managed system, then the backing devices for that virtual NIC must be hosted by two different VIOSs on the destination managed system. If the management console is not able to do this for all of a partition's virtual NICs, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --migsriov

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether the management console  is  required  to  recreate  each  partition's migratable  SR-IOV logical  ports  on  the  destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to recreate the migratable SR-IOV logical ports, or 2 if the management console is not required to recreate the migratable SR-IOV logical ports, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If  this  option  has  a  value  of 1 and  the  management  console  cannot  guarantee  that  a  partition's migratable  SR-IOV logical  ports  can  be  recreated  on  the  destination  managed  system,  then  an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --sriovlogportcfg

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the configuration of each partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain the migratable SR-IOV logical port configuration, or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain the migratable SR-IOV logical port configuration, but should do so if possible.  If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

Specifying a value of 2 for this option will allow the validation or migration operation to succeed ev  en if the management console is not able to maintain each migratable SR-IOV logical port's port

VLAN ID, allowed VLAN IDs, allowed MAC addresses or capacity configuration on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --vniccfg

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the configuration of each partition's virtual NICs on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain the virtual NIC configuration, or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain the virtual NIC configuration, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

Specifying a value of 2 for this option will allow the validation or migration operation to succeed ev  en if the management console is not able to maintain each virtual NIC's allowed VLAN IDs and maximum capacity configuration on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --affinity

When migrating a single partition, use this option to specify that the affinity score of the partition is  required to be maintained on the destination managed system. If  the  affinity  score  cannot  be maintained, an error will occur and the partition migration will fail.

If this option is not specified, the affinity score of the partition is not required to be maintained on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when migrating a single partition. This option is not valid when performing a validation operation or any other operation.

## --usecurrdata

Use this option to allow partitions to be migrated when Virtual I/O Servers that are hosting their virtual SCSI or virtual fibre channel adapters are shutdown and the storage adapter data that has been previously collected for the partitions is stale. The partitions will be migrated using the stale data.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --viosfcportlabel

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether VIOS Fibre Channel (FC) port labels are to be used when determining mappings of virtual FC adapters when specific virtual  FC  adapter  mappings  are  not  specified. Valid  values  are 1 if  VIOS  FC  port  labels  are required to be used, or 2 if  VIOS FC port labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS FC port label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

If VIOS FC port labels are required to be used and the management console cannot find a destination VIOS to host each partition's virtual FC adapter which has an FC port label that matches the FC port label on the source VIOS hosting the adapter, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --viosmsplabel

When  validating  or  migrating  active  partitions,  use  this  option  to  specify  whether  VIOS  MSP group  labels  are  to  be  used  when  determining  source  and  destination  MSP  pairs  when  specific source or destination MSPs are not specified on this command. Valid values are 1 if VIOS MSP group labels are required to be used, or 2 if VIOS MSP group labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS MSP group label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

If VIOS MSP group labels are required to be used and labels are specified using the msp\_labels attribute, if the management console cannot find the required number of MSP pairs that have those labels to use, an error will occur and the operation will fail.  Otherwise, if VIOS MSP group labels are required to be used and labels are not specified using the msp\_labels attribute, if the management console cannot find the required number of MSP pairs that have any matching include labels to use, an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating active partitions.  This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --viosstoragelabel

When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether VIOS virtual FC and virtual  SCSI  group  labels  are  to  be  used  when  determining  mappings  of  virtual  FC  and  virtual SCSI adapters when specific virtual FC or virtual SCSI adapter mappings are not specified. Valid values are 1 if VIOS virtual FC and virtual SCSI group labels are required to be used, or 2 if VIOS virtual FC and virtual SCSI group labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS storage group label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

If VIOS storage group labels are required to be used and the management console cannot find a destination VIOS to host each partition's virtual FC or virtual SCSI adapter which has a label that matches a label of the source VIOS hosting the adapter, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## --viosvniclabel

When  validating  or  migrating  partitions,  use  this  option  to  specify  whether  VIOS  virtual  NIC group labels are to be used when determining mappings of virtual NICs when specific virtual NIC mappings are not specified. Valid values are 1 if VIOS virtual NIC group labels are required to be used, or 2 if VIOS virtual NIC group labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS virtual NIC group label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

If VIOS virtual NIC group labels are required to be used and the management console cannot find a destination VIOS to host each partition's virtual NIC which has a label that matches a label of the source VIOS hosting the virtual NIC, an error will occur and the operation will fail for that partition.

This option is only valid when validating or migrating partitions. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

## MSP-name / MSP-ID / [ MSP-IP-address ]

Both ' / ' characters must be present, but optional values may be omitted. Optional values are MSP-name or MSP-ID (one of those values is required, but not both), and MSP-IP-address .

If redundant MSPs are to be used, you can either use this attribute to specify the source MSPs to use, or use the redundant\_msps attribute.  The source\_msps attribute and redundant\_msps attribute are mutually exclusive.

## For example:

msp1//9.1.2.3 specifies to use IP address 9.1.2.3 on source MSP msp1 for the operation.

## dest\_msps

Comma separated list of destination MSPs to use for the operation. The format is:

MSP-name / MSP-ID / [ MSP-IP-address ]

Both ' / ' characters must be present, but optional values may be omitted. Optional values are MSP-name or MSP-ID (one of those values is required, but not both), and MSP-IP-address .

If redundant MSPs are to be used, you can either use this attribute to specify the destination MSPs to use, or use the redundant\_msps attribute.  The dest\_msps attribute and redundant\_msps attribute are mutually exclusive.

## For example:

msp1// specifies to use any IP address on destination MSP msp1 for the operation.

## redundant\_msps

Comma separated list of redundant MSP pairs to use for the operation. The format is:

group-ID / [ source-MSP-name ] / [ source-MSP-ID ] / [ source-MSP-IP-address ] / [ dest-MSP-name ] / [ dest-MSP-ID ] / [ dest-MSP-IP-address ]

All 6 ' / ' characters must be present, but optional values may be omitted. Optional values are source-MSP-name and source-MSP-ID (one of those values is required, but not both), source-MSP-IP-address , dest-MSP-name and dest-MSP-ID (one of those values is required, but not both), and dest-MSP-IP-address .

The group-ID can be any integer, and is used to identify the 2 MSP pairs that are redundant with each other.

If redundant MSPs are to be used, you can either use this attribute to specify the source and destination MSPs to use, or use the source\_msps and dest\_msps attributes.  The redundant\_msps attribute and the source\_msps and dest\_msps attributes are mutually exclusive.

## For example:

1/src-vios1///dest-vios1//,1/src-vios2///dest-vios2// specifies that MSP pair src-vios1 on the source managed system and dest-vios1 on the destination managed system and MSP pair src-vios2 on the source managed system and dest-vios2 on the destination managed system are to be used as a redundant MSP pair.

## msp\_labels

Comma separated list of VIOS MSP group include labels to use for the operation. This attribute cannot be used with any other attribute that specifies MSPs to use for the operation ( source\_msp *, dest\_msp *, redundant\_msps ).

Attributes that can be specified for a system set operation:

## inactive\_prof\_policy

Sets the default profile policy to use when validating or migrating inactive partitions when the system is the source managed system for the operation.  You can override this value for a partition by specifying it on the validation or migration operation.

Valid values are:

prof - use the last activated profile for partitions when validating or migrating inactive partitions config - use the current configuration of partitions when validating or migrating inactive partitions

## allow\_inactive\_source\_storage\_vios

Valid values are:

- 0 - disable virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapter data collection for all AIX, Linux, and IBM i partitions in the managed system.
- 1 - enable virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapter data collection for all AIX, Linux, and IBM i partitions in the managed system. The data is collected from the VIOS partitions hosting the client adapters to allow the partitions to be migrated when VIOS partitions on the source managed system are shutdown.

Attributes that can be specified for an MSP set operation:

## num\_active\_migrations\_configured concurr\_migration\_perf\_level

Sets the default concurrency lev  el to use on the MSP. You can override this value for a partition

validation or migration operation by specifying it on the operation.

Valid values are 1 -5

Input data for this command can be specified with this option or the -i option.  The -f and the -i options are mutually exclusive.

Input data can be specified when migrating partitions, validating partition migrations, or performing a set operation. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- -i This  option  allows  you  to  enter  input  data  on  the  command  line,  instead  of  using  a  file.  Data entered on the command line must follow the same format as data in a file, and must be enclosed in double quotes.

Input data for this command can be specified with this option or the -f option.  The -i and the -f options are mutually exclusive.

Input data can be specified when migrating partitions, validating partition migrations, or performing a set operation. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- -r The type of resource for which to set attributes related to partition migration operations. Valid values are sys for managed system, and lpar for mover service partition.
- -w The maximum time, in minutes, to wait for operating system commands issued by the management console to the partitions to be migrated to complete. If an operating system command does not complete within the time specified, the partition migration operation for that partition will be stopped.

wait-time must be a whole number. If wait-time is 0, the partition migration operation will not be timed out.

If this option is not specified, a default value of 3 minutes is used.

This option is valid when migrating partitions or validating partition migrations. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- -d The level of detail requested from operating system commands issued by the management console to all partitions participating in migrations. Valid values are 1 (lowest) through 5 (highest).

If this option is not specified, a default value of 1 is used.

This option is valid when migrating partitions or validating partition migrations. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- --force This option allows you to force a recover operation to proceed when errors are encountered.

This option is only valid when recovering from a failed partition migration.

- --steps When validating or migrating partitions, use this option to specify whether to display the steps that are completed during the operation if the operation fails.  Note that the steps are displayed after the operation  has  finished. Valid  values  are 0 to  display  no  step  information, 1 to  display  all  step information, and 2 to display only failed step information. If this option is not specified it defaults to 0 .

This option is valid when migrating partitions or validating partition migrations. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- -v Specify this option to enable verbose mode for the partition migration operation. When verbose mode  is  enabled,  detail  messages  and  warning  messages  are  displayed  for  successful  partition

migrations.  Detail messages and warning messages are displayed for partition migrations that fail, regardless of whether this option is specified.

When the --nodetails option is also specified, no detail messages are displayed.

## --nodetails

Specify this option to suppress the display of all detail messages.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXIT STATUS

This command has the following return codes:

- 0 Success
- 100 Partial success

When an operation is performed for multiple partitions, this value is returned when the operation for at least one partition succeeds, and the operation for at least one partition fails.

Any other value means the command failed.

## EXAMPLES

In the following examples nested double quote characters are preceded by an escape character ('\'). The escape characters are required to run the commands locally on an HMC.

Validate the operation to migrate partition mylpar from managed system system1 to managed system system2 :

## OPTIONS

- -t The type of access control role to create. Valid values are resourcerole for managed resource role and taskrole for task role.
- -f The name of the file containing the configuration data needed to create the access control role. The configuration data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format. These attribute name/value pairs form a configuration record. A line feed marks the end of a configuration record. There can only be one configuration record in the file.

The format of a configuration record is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...&lt;LF&gt;

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...&lt;LF&gt;

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Attribute names for managed resource roles (all attributes are required):

## name

name of the managed resource role to create

## resources

comma separated list of managed resource objects

Attribute names for task roles (all attributes are required):

## name

name of the task role to create

## resources

comma separated list of tasks

## parent

name of the parent task role on which to base this task role. Valid values are hmcsuperadmin , hmcoperator , hmcviewer , hmcpe , hmcservicerep , hmcclientliveupdate ,

or a user-defined task role.

The -f and the -i options are mutually exclusive.

## NAME

mkauthkeys - manage SSH authentication keys

## SYNOPSIS

To add an SSH key as an authorized key ( " string " must be the last option specified):

mkauthkeys { -a | --add } [ -u user-ID ] " string "

To remove an SSH key from the authorized keys (if specified, " string " must be the last option specified): mkauthkeys { -r | --remove } [ -u user-ID ] [ " string " ]

To  set up SSH key authentication for partition mobility, partition remote restart, and virtual serial number (VSN) transfer operations between this Hardware Management Console (HMC) and another management console:

mkauthkeys [ -g ] --ip IP-address -u user-ID [ --passwd password ] [ -t { rsa | dsa }]

To test SSH key authentication for partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations from this HMC to another management console:

mkauthkeys --test --ip IP-address [ -u user-ID ]

## DESCRIPTION

mkauthkeys manages SSH authentication keys.

mkauthkeys can be used to add or remove SSH keys as authorized keys for HMC users.

mkauthkeys can  also  be  used  to  set  up  SSH  key  authentication  for  partition  mobility, partition  remote restart, and VSN transfer operations between this HMC and another management console.

## OPTIONS

## -a , --add

Adds the specified SSH key string as an authorized key for the specified user. If a user is not specified, the key is added for the user which issues this command.

The string is added to the user's $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys2 file.

## -r , --remove

Removes the SSH keys that contain the specified string from the authorized keys for the specified user. If a user is not specified, the SSH keys that contain the specified string are removed for the user which issues this command.

If this option and no string is specified, then all of the authorized keys for the specified user are removed.  If a user is not specified, all of the authorized keys for the user that issues this command are removed.

The keys are removed from the user's $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys2 file.

- -u When adding or removing authorized SSH keys for another user, use this option to specify the user ID.

When setting up SSH key authentication for partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations between this HMC and another management console, use this option to specify the user ID to use on the remote management console.

- string To  add or remove an SSH key as an authorized key, specify the SSH key to add or remove with this option.

To  remove all of the SSH keys generated for a user from the authorized keys for the user which issues this command, specify the user for which the SSH keys to remove were generated.

This option must be the last option specified on the command.

- --ip The IP address or host name of the remote management console with which to set up partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations.

Public and private SSH keys will be generated for the ccfw user on this HMC. The keys will be stored on this HMC in the $HOME/.ssh/ccfw directory for the user which issues this command. Then, if SSH keys hav  e not already been set up on the remote management console for the remote user, then the saved public key will be sent to the remote management console and stored in the remote user's $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys2 file.

## --passwd

When setting up SSH key authentication for partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations between this HMC and another management console, use this option to specify the password for the user ID to use on the remote management console. If this option is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.

- -t The type of SSH keys to generate when setting up SSH key authentication for partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations between this HMC and another management console.  Valid values are rsa for RSA or dsa for DSA. If this option is not specified, then RSA keys will be generated.
- -g Specify this option when setting up SSH key authentication for partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations between this HMC and another management console to allow partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations to be performed from the remote management console to this HMC. If this option is not specified, then partition mobility, partition remote restart, and VSN transfer operations can only be performed from this HMC to the remote management console.

When this option is specified, public and private SSH keys will also be generated for the ccfw user on the remote management console. The keys will be stored on the remote management console in the remote user's $HOME/.ssh/ccfw directory. Then, if SSH keys hav  e not already been set up on this HMC for the user that issues this command, then the saved public key will be sent to this HMC and stored in this user's $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys2 file.

- --test Tests  SSH  key  authentication  for  partition  mobility, partition  remote  restart,  and  VSN  transfer operations from this HMC to the management console specified with the --ip option.

If the return code from this command is 0, then SSH key authentication is working properly.

--help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

To  add the SSH key ssh-rsa AAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA joe@somehost , which was generated for the user joe@somehost , as an authorized key for your user ID:

## mkauthkeys -a "ssh-rsa AAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA joe@somehost"

To  add the SSH key ssh-rsa AAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA joe@somehost , which was generated for the user joe@somehost , as an authorized key for user hmcUser1 :

mkcodpool - create a CoD Power enterprise pool

## SYNOPSIS

mkcodpool -p pool-name -f file [ -a attributes ] [ -v ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

mkcodpool creates a Capacity on Demand (CoD) Power enterprise pool.

## OPTIONS

- -p A name for the Power enterprise pool.
- -f The name of the XML file that contains the Power enterprise pool configuration data. If file is not fully qualified, file must exist in the user's home directory on the Hardware Management Console (HMC).

If file exists on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the HMC.

- -a The  Power  enterprise  pool  attributes. The attribute  data  consists  of  attribute  name/value  pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The format of the attribute data is as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Valid attribute names:

## mcs

Comma separated list of managing HMCs for the pool, with each managing HMC having the following format:

host-name-or-IP-address / user-ID / [ password ][ / [ restricted-ops ]]

The first 2 ' / ' characters must be present. The 3rd ' / ' character is optional, but it must be present if restricted-ops is specified.

Optional values may be omitted. Optional values are password and restricted-ops . If password is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.

Valid values for restricted-ops :

- 0 - users are not restricted from initiating add and remove Mobile CoD resource operations from this managing HMC (default value)
- 1 - users are restricted from initiating add and remove Mobile CoD resource operations from this managing HMC

Note: do not include the HMC which is running this command in the list.

For example:

hmc1/user1/ prompts the user for user1 's password then uses that password and the user ID user1 to log into the HMC with host name hmc1 to add that HMC to the pool.

- -v Specify this option to enable verbose mode. When verbose mode is enabled, warning messages and  informational  messages  are  displayed  for  successful  create  pool  operations. Warning messages and informational messages are displayed for create pool operations that partially succeed or fail, regardless of whether this option is specified.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXIT STATUS

This command has the following return codes:

- 0 Success
- 100 Partial success

This value is returned when at least one operation in the configuration file succeeded, and at least one failed.

Any other value means the command failed.

## EXAMPLES

Create the Power enterprise pool pool1 using the configuration file pool0195.xml on a USB flash memory device (the USB flash memory device must already be connected to the HMC) and add HMC hmc1 to the pool:

lsmediadev (to obtain mount points)

## mount /media/sdb1

mkcodpool -p pool1 -f /media/sdb1/pool0195.xml

- -a "mcs=hmc1/myuserID/mypassword" -v

Create the Power enterprise pool myPool using the configuration file pool.xml in the user's home directory on the HMC and add the HMCs hmc1 and hmc2 to the pool (you will be prompted to enter the password for each HMC):

mkcodpool -p myPool -f pool.xml -a ""mcs=hmc1/myuserID/, hmc2/myuserID/"" -v

## NAME

mkhmccert - create a Hardware Management Console certificate

## SYNOPSIS

To create and apply a self-signed certificate:

mkhmccert -t self [ -i " configuration-data " ] [ --force ] [ -r ] [ --help ]

To create a certificate signing request (CSR):

mkhmccert -t ca -f file-name [ -l { usb | sftp }]

[ -h host-name ] [ -u user-ID ] [ --passwd password ]

[ -k SSH-private-key ] [ -d directory ]

[ -i " configuration-data " ] [ --temp [ -r ]] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

mkhmccert creates a Hardware Management Console (HMC) certificate.

After a self-signed certificate is created, the HMC will automatically be restarted to apply the certificate.

## OPTIONS

- -t The type of certificate to create. Valid values are self to create a self-signed certificate, and ca to create  a  certificate  signing  request  (CSR)  for  the  server  where  the  Certificate  Authority  (CA) signed certificate will be issued.
- -f The name of the file where the CSR is to be saved.
- -l The location where the CSR is to be saved.  Valid values are usb for a USB data storage device, and sftp for a secure FTP (SFTP) server. If this option is not specified, the CSR will be saved to the HMC hard disk.
- -h The host name or IP address of the SFTP server where the CSR is to be saved.

This option is required when the CSR is to be saved on an SFTP server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the SFTP server.

This option is required when the CSR is to be saved on an SFTP server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the SFTP server.

If both this option and the -k option are omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when the CSR is to be saved on an SFTP server.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If both this option and the --passwd option are omitted and the CSR is to be saved on an SFTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when the CSR is to be saved on an SFTP server.

- -d The directory where the CSR is to be saved.
- -i The input data for the command. The input data consists of attribute name/value pairs, which are in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The format of the input data is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Valid attribute names for this command:

org org\_unit country Tw  o-character ISO country code state locality days\_to\_expire email ipaddrs Comma separated list dns Comma separated list common\_name Only valid for a CSR key\_size Only valid for a self-signed certificate Valid values are 2048 (default), 3072 , and 4096

- --temp When creating a CSR, specify this option to create a temporary self-signed certificate to be used until the CA returns the signed certificate.

The HMC will automatically be restarted to apply the temporary self-signed certificate.

- -r Specify this option to cause the HMC to automatically be restarted without asking for confirmation after applying a self-signed certificate.
- --force Specify this option to allow a self-signed certificate to be created without a domain name.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Create a self-signed certificate (the HMC will automatically be restarted to apply the certificate):

mkhmccert -t self -i "org=TEST,org\_unit=HMC,country=US,state=Texas, locality=Austin,email=support@company.com,days\_to\_expire=365, ipaddrs=9.2.155.119,dns=dns1@company.com"

Create a CSR and save it to a SFTP server and use SSH keys for authentication:

## NAME

mkprofdata - create profile data

## SYNOPSIS

To recreate profile data: mkprofdata -r sys -o recreate -m managed-system -s sys [ -v ] [ --help ] To convert profile data to XML: mkprofdata -r sys -o createxml { -m managed-system | -b binary-file } -x XML-file [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

mkprofdata recreates the profile data for managed-system based on the current configuration of managedsystem . This operation will overwrite the current profile data for the managed system so it should only be performed if the profile data for the managed system is corrupted. This operation will create a single profile for each partition in the managed system. This profile will match the current configuration of the partition on the managed system. Any profile attributes not stored on the managed system, including the profile name, will be set to default values. Since no existing partition profiles can be recovered, when this operation completes only the newly created profile will exist for each partition along with the last valid configuration profile that the HMC automatically creates for every partition.

mkprofdata can also be used to convert the profile data for a managed system to XML format and save it to a file.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of resource for which to recreate or convert profile data. The only valid value is sys for managed system.
- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are recreate to recreate the profile data for a managed system based on the current configuration of the managed system, and createxml to convert the profile data for a managed system to XML format and save it to a file.
- -m The name of the managed system for which to perform the profile data operation. The name may either  be  the  user-defined  name  for  the  managed  system,  or  be  in  the  form tttt -mmm * ssssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and ssssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * ssssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

If this option is specified when converting profile data to XML format, the current profile data on the managed system will be used. The -m and the -b options are mutually exclusive.

- -s The source for the profile data recreate operation. The only valid value is sys for managed system. The profile data for the managed system will be recreated based on the current configuration of the managed system.
- -b The name of the files containing the binary profile data to be converted to XML format. binaryfile must be a fully qualified file name (it must include the directory name). Both files containing the binary profile data, binary-file and binary-file .dir , must be present for the operation to be performed.

If the files are on removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the management console.

The -b and the -m options are mutually exclusive.

- -x The name of the files to which the profile data is to be written in XML format. If XML-file is not fully qualified, XML-file will be written to the user's home directory. Two files will be written: XML-file .xml and XML-file \_dir.xml .

If the files are to be written to removable media, the media must be present in the removable media device and the device must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued. The lsmediadev command can be used to display all of the removable media devices on the management console.

- -v Specify this option to enable verbose mode for the profile data recreate operation. When verbose mode is enabled, progress messages are displayed.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Recreate the profile data for the managed system mySys :

## mkprofdata -r sys -o recreate -m mySys -s sys -v

Convert  the  current  profile  data  on  managed  system mySys to  XML  format  and  save  it in the  files mySysXML.xml and mySysXML\_dir.xml in the user's home directory:

## mkprofdata -r sys -o createxml -m mySys -x mySysXML

Convert the profile data in the files /home/hscpe/sysA and /home/hscpe/sysA.dir to XML format and save it in the files sysAXML.xml and sysAXML\_dir.xml in the user's home directory:

mkprofdata -r sys -o createxml -b /home/hscpe/sysA -x sysAXML

## NAME

mksyscfg - create system resources

## SYNOPSIS

```
mksyscfg -r { lpar | prof | sysprof } -m managed-system [{ -f configuration-file | -i " configuration-data " }] [ -o save { -p partition-name | --id partition-ID } -n profile-name [ --force ]] [ --help ]
```

## DESCRIPTION

mksyscfg creates partitions, partition profiles, or system profiles for the managed-system .

mksyscfg can also be used to save the current configuration of a partition to a partition profile.

## USAGE IN A POWERVM MANAGEMENT CONTROLLER MODE ENVIRONMENT

When the managed-system is in PowerVM management controller mode, the mksyscfg -r lpar command may  be  used  to  create  a  partition,  however the  following  attributes  are  not  allowed: profile\_name and sync\_curr\_profile . The partition will be configured immediately with the specified attributes.  The Hardware Management Console (HMC) must be the current PowerVM management controller for the managedsystem when running the mksyscfg -r lpar command.

The mksyscfg -r prof and mksyscfg -r sysprof commands are not allowed.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of system resources to create. Valid values are lpar for partitions, prof for partition profiles, and sysprof for system profiles.

When a partition is created, the default profile for the partition is also created.

- -m The name of the managed system for which the system resources are to be created. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form  must  be  used  if  there  are  multiple  managed  systems  with  the same user-defined name.
- -f The name of the file containing the configuration data needed to create the system resources. The configuration  data  consists  of  attribute  name/value  pairs,  which  are  in  comma  separated  value (CSV) format. These attribute name/value pairs form a configuration record. A line feed marks the end of a configuration record. The file must contain one configuration record for each resource to be created, and each configuration record must be for the same resource type.

The format of a configuration record is as follows:

attribute-name = value , attribute-name = value , ...&lt;LF&gt;

Note that certain attributes accept a comma separated list of values, as follows:

" attribute-name = value , value , ... ", ...&lt;LF&gt;

When a list of values is specified, the attribute name/value pair must be enclosed in double quotes. Depending on the shell being used, nested double quote characters may need to be preceded by an escape character, which is usually a '\' character.

Attribute names for partitions (see below for attribute names that are common to both partitions and partition profiles):

## name

name of the partition to create

## [ lpar\_id ]

## profile\_name

name of the default profile to create

## lpar\_env

Valid values are aixlinux , os400 , or vioserver

## [ allow\_perf\_collection ]

Valid values are:

0 - do not allow

1 - allow

This attribute replaces the shared\_proc\_pool\_util\_auth attribute.

Setting this attribute also sets the

## shared\_proc\_pool\_util\_auth attribute

to the same value.

## [ shared\_proc\_pool\_util\_auth ]

Valid values are:

0 - do not allow authority

1 - allow authority

This attribute has been deprecated. Use the allow\_perf\_collection attribute

instead.  Setting this attribute also sets the allow\_perf\_collection

attribute to the same value.

## [ lpar\_avail\_priority ]

Valid values are 0 -255 .

## [ msp ]

Virtual I/O server only

Valid values are:

- 0 - the partition is not a mover service partition
- 1 - the partition is a mover service partition

## [ time\_ref ]

Valid values are:

- 0 - the partition is not a time reference partition
- 1 - the partition is a time reference partition

## [ suspend\_capable ]

AIX, Linux, and IBM i only

Valid values are:

- 0 - the partition cannot be suspended
- 1 - the partition can be suspended

## [ simplified\_remote\_restart\_capable ]

AIX, Linux, and IBM i only

Valid values are:

- 0 - remote restart without using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition
- 1 - remote restart without using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition

## [ remote\_restart\_capable ]

AIX, Linux, and IBM i only

Valid values are:

| 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   | 0 - remote restart using a reserved storage device cannot be performed for the partition 1 - remote restart using a reserved storage device can be performed for the partition   |

## NAME

mksysconn - create system connection

## SYNOPSIS

To establish a connection and add a system to the Hardware Management Console (HMC):

mksysconn --ip IP-address [ -u user-ID ] [ --passwd password ]

[ --force ] [ --help ]

To enable all systems to be automatically discovered by the HMC when using DHCP:

mksysconn -o auto [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

mksysconn establishes a connection from the Hardware Management Console (HMC) to a system in the network and adds the system to the systems managed by the HMC. If a connection to the system cannot be established because the network is down, the service processor for the system is down, or too many other HMCs have already established a connection to the system, the system will be added as a managed system which is in the No Connection state.

If your HMC is set up as a DHCP server on a private network, mksysconn -o auto can enable all systems to  be  automatically  discovered  by  the  HMC  in  the  event  that  the  Remove  Connection  task  or  the rmsysconn command was previously run to remove a system from the HMC.

If your HMC is set up as a DHCP server on a private network, do not use this command to establish HMC connections to managed systems that are DHCP clients. This command is intended for use on a public network only, where the systems are set to use static IP addresses. Using this command in a DHCP environment establishes a temporary connection that will not continue to work properly over network configuration changes, system power loss, and service repair actions.

## OPTIONS

- --ip To  connect to a system and add the system to the systems managed by the HMC, specify the IP address or host name of the service processor for the system.
- -u The user ID for the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) or Enterprise BMC to which to connect.  If you are not using the default user ID for the BMC or Enterprise BMC, use this option to specify the user ID you are using. Otherwise omit this option and the default user ID will be used.

This option is only valid for OpenPower systems and Enterprise BMC-based systems.

## --passwd

The HMC Access password for the system to which to connect. If this option is omitted, you will be prompted to enter the password.

- --force If the HMC is unable to determine if the specified IP address belongs to a system, use this option to force the HMC to attempt to establish a connection.
- -o If your HMC is set up as a DHCP server on a private network, specify auto with this option to enable the HMC to automatically discover all systems. You may need to do this if the Remove Connection  task  or  the rmsysconn command was previously run to remove  a  system  from  the HMC, and you want the HMC to be able to manage a system with the same IP address again. Whenever a managed system is removed from the HMC when using DHCP, the HMC places the IP address(es) of that system in a list of removed IP addresses.  Any IP address in that list will not be automatically rediscovered by the HMC. The mksysconn -o auto command removes all IP addresses  from  that  list. To  remove  a  specific  IP  address  from  that  list,  you  can  run  the rmsysconn -o rediscover command instead.

auto is  the  only  value  that  can  be  specified  with  this  option. When this option is specified, all other options are ignored.

--help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Connect to and add the system with the host name sys1.company.com :

## mksysconn --ip sys1.company.com --passwd sys1pw

Connect to and add the system with the IP address 9.3.152.145 (the HMC Access password for the system must be entered when prompted):

## mksysconn --ip 9.3.152.145

To enable all systems to be automatically discovered by the HMC when using DHCP:

mksysconn -o auto

## NAME

mksysplan - make system plan file

## SYNOPSIS

mksysplan -f file-name -m managed-system [ --check ] [ -d " description " ] [ --noprobe ] [ --nohwdisc ] [ --noinvscout ] [ -v ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

mksysplan creates a system plan file that represents the information known about the hardware, partitions, profiles, and partition provisioning for the managed-system .

By default, mksysplan will perform additional inventory probes of active partitions and attempt hardware discovery for inactive partitions or unallocated hardware.

## OPTIONS

- -f Specifies the file name that will contain the system plan that this command creates. If the file does not exist, the command will create it in the system plan file directory on the Hardware Management Console (HMC). If the file exists, the command will overwrite the contents of the file unless the --check option is specified.

The file name can only consist of the alphanumeric characters (upper and lower case) and a set of special characters (comma, period, hyphen, underscore, and space). The file name cannot begin with a period or hyphen.

The file name must end with the .sysplan suffix.

- -m Specifies the name of the managed system that the command will use to get the information to create the system plan file.

The name can be either the user-defined name for the managed system, or it can be in the form ttttmmm*sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt-mmm*sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

## --check

Specifies that this command will check the system plan directory to see if the file name specified with the -f option already exists. If the file does exist, the command will fail with an error message.

- -d Specifies a description that the command will add to the created file.

## --noprobe

Limit the inventory gathering to obtain only the PCI slot devices without any further inventory probes of active partitions, without any refresh of inactive partition or unallocated hardware information, and without gathering additional information from VIOS partitions.

## --nohwdisc

Do not perform hardware discovery for inactive partitions or unallocated hardware.

## --noinvscout

Do not perform additional inventory probes of active partitions.

- -v Displays verbose output during command processing, in addition to the default messages.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Make a system plan file sysplan.sysplan that represents the configuration of the managed system mySystem :

## mksysplan -f sysplan.sysplan -m mySystem

Make a system  plan  file sysplan.sysplan that  represents  the  configuration  of  the  managed  system 9406-570*3413556 , and only survey PCI devices in slots:

mksysplan  -f  sysplan.sysplan  -m  9406-570*3413556  -d  "New  570  system  plan  for  5/11/2007" --noprobe

## NAME

optmem - optimize memory

## SYNOPSIS

To start a mirrored memory defragmentation operation on a managed system:

optmem -m managed-system -o start -t mirror

[ -q quantity ] [ --minutes time-limit ]

To start a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation on a managed system:

optmem -m managed-system -o start -t affinity

[ -p partition-names | --id partition-IDs ]

[ -x partition-names | --xid partition-IDs ]

To stop a memory optimization operation on a managed system:

optmem -m managed-system -o stop [ --optid ID ]

## DESCRIPTION

optmem performs  memory  optimization  operations  on  the managed-system . The  memory  optimization operations that can be performed with this command are mirrored memory defragmentation operations and Dynamic Platform Optimization operations.

Dynamic Platform Optimization operations dynamically optimize the placement of partitions to maximize the processor-memory affinity of the partitions, which improves system performance. You can specify a list of partitions to prioritize for optimization, and a list of partitions to protect from the optimization. Partitions which are not specified in either list could be either positively or negatively impacted by the optimization.  The lsmemopt command can be used to evaluate the current system affinity and the potential system affinity that could be attained by running a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation.

When a memory optimization operation is in progress, another memory optimization operation cannot be started.  In addition, operations that change the memory or processor configuration in the system are not allowed.

System performance will degrade during a memory optimization operation. A memory optimization operation may take a long time to complete.

## OPTIONS

- -m The name of the managed system on which to perform the memory optimization operation. The name  may  either  be  the  user-defined  name  for  the  managed  system,  or  be  in  the  form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are start to  start  a  memory optimization operation, and stop to stop the memory optimization operation that is currently in progress. The managed system may not be able to stop the operation immediately, so it may continue to run for several more seconds.

Dynamic Platform Optimization operations should not be stopped. Stopping a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation before it has completed could leave the system in an affinity state that is much worse than before the operation started.

- -t The  type  of  memory  optimization  to  perform. Valid  values  are mirror to  perform  a  mirrored memory  defragmentation  operation,  and affinity to  perform  a  Dynamic  Platform  Optimization operation.
- -q The amount of mirrored memory to be made available by the defragmentation operation. Specify only the additional amount of mirrored memory to be made available; do not include the amount of  mirrored  memory  that  is  currently  available. quantity must  be  in  megabytes,  it  must  be  a

multiple of the memory region size for the managed-system , and it must be greater than 0.

As much additional mirrored memory as possible, up to quantity , will be made available by the defragmentation operation. If this option is not specified, then the maximum amount of mirrored memory will be made available.

## --minutes

The time limit, in minutes, for the mirrored memory defragmentation operation. If the operation does not complete within the time limit specified, the operation will be stopped.

The  managed  system  may  not  be  able  to  stop  the  operation  immediately  when  the  time  limit expires, so it may continue to run for several more seconds.

If this option is not specified, the mirrored memory defragmentation operation will not be timed out.

- -p The name of one or more partitions to prioritize for optimization in a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation.

Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the names of the partitions to prioritize for optimization, or use the --id option to specify the IDs of the partitions. The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the --id option is used to specify a list of partitions to prioritize, the managed system will optimize partitions based on its own prioritization. In either case, the managed system will attempt to optimize all partitions except those that are specified in the list of partitions to exclude from the operation.

- --id The ID of one or more partitions to prioritize for optimization in a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation.

A range of partition IDs may be specified. A range is specified by specifying the beginning partition  ID,  a  dash,  and  the  ending  partition  ID. Both  the  beginning  and  ending  partition  IDs  are included in the range. For example, the range 1-5 includes partitions IDs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The list of partition IDs specified with this option must be comma separated and can include one or more partition IDs, one or more ranges of partition IDs, or both.

You can either use this option to specify the IDs of the partitions to prioritize for optimization, or use the -p option to specify the names of the partitions. The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the -p option is used to specify a list of partitions to prioritize, the managed system will optimize partitions based on its own prioritization. In either case, the managed system will attempt to optimize all partitions except those that are specified in the list of partitions to exclude from the operation.

- -x The name of one or more partitions to exclude and protect from the Dynamic Platform Optimization operation. The processor-memory affinity for the partitions will not be impacted by the operation.

Multiple partition names must be comma separated.

You can either use this option to specify the names of the partitions to exclude, or use the --xid option to specify the IDs of the partitions. The -x and the --xid options are mutually exclusive.

## --xid

If neither this option nor the --xid option is used to specify a list of partitions to exclude, no partitions will be excluded from the operation.

The ID of one or more partitions to exclude and protect from the Dynamic Platform Optimization operation.  The processor-memory affinity for the partitions will not be impacted by the operation.

A range of partition IDs may be specified. A range is specified by specifying the beginning partition  ID,  a  dash,  and  the  ending  partition  ID. Both  the  beginning  and  ending  partition  IDs  are included in the range. For example, the range 8-11 includes partitions IDs 8, 9, 10, and 11.

The list of partition IDs specified with this option must be comma separated and can include one or more partition IDs, one or more ranges of partition IDs, or both.

You can either use this option to specify the IDs of the partitions to exclude, or use the -x option to specify the names of the partitions. The --xid and the -x options are mutually exclusive.

If neither this option nor the -x option is used to specify a list of partitions to exclude, no partitions will be excluded from the operation.

- --optid The ID of the memory optimization operation to stop. If this option is omitted, then the memory optimization operation currently in progress is stopped. The ID is displayed by the lsmemopt -m managed-system command.

Although this option is not required to stop a memory optimization operation, it is highly recommended that it be specified to prevent the accidental cancellation of the wrong operation.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Start a mirrored memory defragmentation operation with no time limit to make an additional 256 MB of mirrored memory available:

## optmem -m system1 -o start -t mirror -q 256

Start a mirrored memory defragmentation operation with a time limit of 1 hour to make as much mirrored memory available as possible:

## optmem -m 8233-E8B*1234321 -o start -t mirror --minutes 60

Stop the mirrored memory defragmentation operation currently in progress:

## optmem -m system1 -o stop

Start a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation to optimize all partitions in the system:

## optmem -m sys -o start -t affinity

Start a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation that prioritizes partitions lp1 and lp3 for optimization:

## optmem -m sys -o start -t affinity -p lp1,lp3

Start a Dynamic Platform Optimization operation that prioritizes the partitions with IDs 2 , 4 , 6 through 9 , and 11 , for optimization, and excludes the partition with ID 1 :

## NAME

refdev - refresh device

## SYNOPSIS

refdev -m managed-system { -p partition-name | --id partition-ID }

[ --viosfcportlabel { 1 | 2

[ -w wait-time ] [ -d detail-level ] [ -v ] [ --help

## DESCRIPTION

refdev refreshes the partition and profile data used for remote restart of the specified partition. The partition and profile data, referred to as remote restart data, is stored on the Hardware Management Console (HMC) hard  disk  for  partitions  that  are  capable  of  simplified  remote  restart.  For  partitions  that  are  capable  of remote restart  but  not  simplified  remote  restart,  the  remote  restart  data  is  stored  on  the  reserved  storage device assigned to the partition.

refdev also refreshes the virtual SCSI and virtual Fibre Channel (FC) adapter data collected from the Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partitions hosting the specified partition's client adapters. This data is used during partition  migration  when  one  or  more  of  the  VIOS  partitions  hosting  the  migrating  partition's client adapters on the source managed system are shutdown. This data is stored on the HMC hard disk and is collected for all AIX, Linux, and IBM i partitions in the managed system when data collection is enabled for the managed system.

The HMC always attempts to automatically keep the remote restart data and the storage adapter data for a partition up to date. However, there may be times when the HMC is unable to update the data for a partition.  If that happens, the user can run this command to force the data to be refreshed.

## OPTIONS

- -m The name of the managed system on which to perform the operation. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.
- -p The name of the partition for which to perform the operation.

You must either use this option to specify the name of the partition, or use the --id option to specify the partition's ID.  The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the partition for which to perform the operation.

You must either use this option to specify the ID of the partition, or use the -p option to specify the partition's name.  The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

## --viosfcportlabel

Use  this  option  to  specify  whether  VIOS  Fibre  Channel  (FC)  port  labels  are  to  be  used  when refreshing virtual FC adapter data. Valid values are 1 if VIOS FC port labels are required to be used,  or 2 if  VIOS  FC  port  labels  are  to  be  used  if  possible. If  this  option  is  not  specified,  it defaults to the value of the VIOS FC port label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

If VIOS FC port labels are required to be used and the partition has a virtual FC adapter hosted by a VIOS partition which does not support FC port labels, the virtual FC adapter data will not be collected.  Specify 2 with this option to collect the virtual FC adapter data.

- -w The maximum time, in minutes, to wait for VIOS commands issued by the HMC to complete. If a VIOS command does not complete within the time specified, the refresh operation will be stopped.

wait-time must be a whole number. If wait-time is 0, the refresh operation will not be timed out.

```
}] ]
```

If this option is not specified, a default value of 3 minutes is used.

- -d The level of detail requested from VIOS commands issued by the HMC. Valid values are 0 (none) through 5 (highest).

If this option is not specified, a default value of 1 is used.

- -v Specify  this  option  to  enable  verbose  mode  for  the  refresh  operation. When  verbose  mode  is enabled, detail messages and warning messages are displayed for a successful operation. Detail messages and warning messages are always displayed for a refresh operation that fails, regardless of whether this option is specified.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## NAME

rmsysconn - remove system connection

## SYNOPSIS

rmsysconn -o { remove | reset | rediscover } { -m managed-system | --ip IP-address } [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

rmsysconn removes or resets a connection from the Hardware Management Console (HMC) to a managed system.

If your HMC is set up as a DHCP server on a private network, you should not use this command to remove HMC connections to managed systems. The remove option of this command is intended for use on a public network only, where the HMC is not set up as a DHCP server. Using the remove option of this command prevents the HMC from managing any system at that IP address, even though that address may still be assigned through DHCP.

If your HMC is set up as a DHCP server on a private network and you do use this command to remove a connection, the HMC places the IP address(es) of the managed system being removed, or places the IP address being removed, in a list of removed IP addresses.  Any IP address in that list will not be automatically rediscovered by the HMC. If you want to remove an IP address from that list so that the IP address can be automatically discovered and the HMC can manage a system at that IP address in the future, use the rediscover option of this command. If you want to remove all IP addresses from that list, you can use the mksysconn -o auto command.

## OPTIONS

- -o The operation to perform. Valid values are remove , reset , or rediscover .

When remove is specified, the HMC disconnects from the specified managed system. If all connections to the managed system are removed, then the managed system is removed from the HMC.

When reset is specified, the HMC disconnects from the specified managed system then attempts to reconnect.  The reset operation is useful for retrying to establish a connection to a managed system that is in the "No Connection" state.

When rediscover is specified, the specified IP address is removed from the HMC's list of removed IP addresses. This will allow the HMC to automatically reconnect to that IP address when using DHCP.

- -m The name of the managed system to remove or to reset the connection to. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.

If  the  managed system has a single service processor, the connection to the service processor is removed or reset.  When the  connection  is  removed,  the  managed  system  is  removed from  the HMC.

If the managed system has two service processors, the connections to both service processors for the managed system are removed or reset.  When the connections to both service processors for the managed system are removed, the managed system is removed from the HMC. To remove or reset the connection to just one service processor for the managed system, use the --ip option.

Either this option or the --ip option is required for a remove or a reset operation. This option is not valid for a rediscover operation.

<!-- image -->

The -m and --ip options are mutually exclusive.

To  remove or reset the connection to a managed system with a single service processor, you can use this option to specify the IP address or host name of the service processor for the managed system to remove or to reset the connection to. Alternatively, you can use the -m option to specify the name of the managed system to remove or to reset the connection to.

To  remove or reset the connection to just one service processor for a managed system with two service processors, you can use this option to specify the IP address or host name of the service processor to remove or to reset the connection to. To  remove or reset the connection to both service processors for a managed system, use the -m option.  Note that a managed system with two service processors will not be removed from the HMC until the connections to both service processors for the managed system are removed.

To allow the HMC to automatically rediscover an IP address when using DHCP, use this option to specify the IP address to be automatically rediscovered.

Either  this  option  or  the -m option  is  required  for  a  remove  or reset  operation. This  option  is required for a rediscover operation.

The --ip and -m options are mutually exclusive.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Disconnect from the managed system mySys and remove it from the HMC:

rmsysconn -o remove -m mySys

Reset the connection to the managed system service processor with IP address 9.3.152.145 :

rmsysconn -o reset --ip 9.3.152.145

Allow the IP address 10.0.0.127 to be automatically rediscovered when using DHCP:

The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form  must  be  used  if  there  are  multiple  managed  systems  with  the same user-defined name.
- -t The name of the target, or destination, managed system for the partition remote restart operation. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number

of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

This option is required for all operations except a clean up operation.

- --ip If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, use this option to specify the IP address or host name of the management console that is managing the destination managed system.

SSH must be enabled on both management consoles. Also, you must run the mkauthkeys command once to set up SSH key authentication.

This  option  is  valid  only  for  partitions  that  support  simplified  remote  restart  operations. This option  is  required  when  remotely  restarting  partitions,  validating  partition  remote  restart  operations, or recovering from a failed partition remote restart if the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system. This option is not valid when performing any other operation.

- -u If the destination managed system is not managed by the same management console that is managing the source managed system, use this option to specify the user ID to use on the management console that is managing the destination managed system. If you do not specify the user ID, then the user ID of the user that issues this command will be used.
- -p The name of the partition for which to perform the remote restart operation.

You must either use this option to specify the name of the partition, or use the --id option to specify the partition's ID.  This option must be used when performing a cancel or recover operation.

The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the partition for which to perform the remote restart operation.

You must either use this option to specify the ID of the partition, or use the -p option to specify the partition's name.  The -p option must be used when performing a cancel or recover operation.

The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

## --redundantvios

When validating or performing the remote restart of a partition using a reserved storage device or a partition that uses shared memory, use this option to specify whether the partition is to be configured  to  use  redundant  VIOS  partitions  on  the  destination  managed  system  for  accessing  the reserved storage device or the paging device assigned to the partition.

Valid values are 0 if the partition is to be configured to not use redundant VIOS partitions, 1 if the partition is to be configured to use redundant VIOS partitions, or 2 if the partition is to be configured to use redundant VIOS partitions if possible. If this option is not specified, then the partition will  be  configured  to  use  the  same  VIOS  redundancy configuration on the destination managed system that the partition is currently using on the source managed system.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

- --mpio When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain an equivalent multipath I/O (MPIO) configuration of each of the partition's virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapters on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain an equivalent MPIO configuration, or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain an equivalent MPIO configuration, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If  this  option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot guarantee that an equivalent MPIO configuration of all of the partition's virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapters can be maintained on the destination managed system, then an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --vlanbridge

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether each of the partition's virtual ethernet adapters are required to be configured so that they are bridged on the same VLAN to an external network on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if virtual ethernet adapters are required to be bridged, or 2 if virtual ethernet adapters are not required to be  bridged,  but  should  be  bridged  if  possible. If  this  option  is  not  specified,  then  this  option defaults to the value 1 .

If this option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot guarantee that the partition's virtual ethernet adapters can be bridged, then an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --redundantsriovadapters

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy of each of the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports and virtual NIC backing devices on the destination managed system.  Valid values are 1 if  the  management console is required to maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy, or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain the SR-IOV adapter redundancy, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 2 .

If  this  option  has  a  value  of 1 , the  management  console  must  be  able  to  maintain  the  SR-IOV adapter redundancy of all of the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports and virtual NIC backing devices on the destination managed system. For example, if two migratable SR-IOV logical ports or two virtual NIC backing devices are on the same SR-IOV adapter on the source managed system, they must be configured on the same SR-IOV adapter on the destination managed system. If two migratable SR-IOV logical ports or two virtual NIC backing devices are on different SRIOV adapters  on  the  source  managed  system,  they must  be  configured  on  different  SR-IOV adapters on the destination managed system. If the management console is not able to do this for all of a partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports and virtual NIC backing devices, an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --redundantvnicbkdev

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the backing device redundancy of each of the partition's virtual NICs on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if  the  management console is required to maintain the virtual NIC backing device redundancy, or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain the virtual NIC backing device redundancy, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If  this  option  has a value of 1 , the management console must be able to map every virtual NIC backing device to a virtual NIC backing device on the destination managed system. In addition, the management console must be able to maintain the VIOS redundancy the backing devices for a virtual NIC provide.  For example, if two backing devices for a virtual NIC are hosted by two different VIOSs on the source managed system, then the backing devices for that virtual NIC must be hosted by two different VIOSs on the destination managed system. If the management console is not able to do this for all of the partition's virtual NICs, an error will occur and the operation will

fail.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --migsriov

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to recreate each of the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports on the destination managed system.

If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

If this option has a value of 1 and the management console cannot guarantee that all of the partition's migratable SR-IOV logical ports can be recreated on the destination managed system, then an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --sriovlogportcfg

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the configuration of each of the partition's migratable SRIOV logical ports on the destination managed system. Valid values are 1 if the management console is required to maintain the migratable SR-IOV logical port configuration, or 2 if the management console is not required to  maintain  the  migratable  SR-IOV logical  port  configuration,  but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

Specifying a value of 2 for this option will allow the validation or remote restart operation to succeed  even if the  management  console  is  not  able  to  maintain  each  migratable  SR-IOV logical port's port VLAN ID, allowed VLAN IDs, allowed MAC addresses or capacity configuration on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --vniccfg

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether the management console is required to maintain the configuration of each of the partition's virtual NICs on the  destination  managed  system. Valid  values  are 1 if  the  management  console  is  required  to maintain the virtual NIC configuration, or 2 if the management console is not required to maintain the virtual NIC configuration, but should do so if possible. If this option is not specified, then this option defaults to the value 1 .

Specifying a value of 2 for this option will allow the validation or remote restart operation to succeed even if the management console is not able to maintain each virtual NIC's allowed VLAN IDs and maximum capacity configuration on the destination managed system.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --viosfcportlabel

Valid values are 1 if VIOS FC port labels are required to be used, or 2 if VIOS FC port labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS FC port label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

If VIOS FC port labels are required to be used and the management console cannot find a destination VIOS to host each partition's virtual FC adapter which has an FC port label that matches the

## --pmem

FC port label on the source VIOS hosting the adapter, an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --viosstoragelabel

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether VIOS virtual Fibre Channel (FC) and virtual SCSI group labels are to be used when determining mappings of virtual FC and virtual SCSI adapters when specific virtual FC or virtual SCSI adapter mappings are not specified. Valid values are 1 if VIOS virtual FC and virtual SCSI group labels are required to be used, or 2 if VIOS virtual FC and virtual SCSI group labels are to be used if possible. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the value of the VIOS storage group label override option for the managed system (see the labelvios and lslabelvios commands).

If VIOS storage group labels are required to be used and the management console cannot find a destination VIOS to host each partition's virtual FC or virtual SCSI adapter which has a label that matches a label of the source VIOS hosting the adapter, an error will occur and the operation will fail.

This option is only valid when performing a validate or remote restart operation.

## --viosvniclabel

When validating or remotely restarting a partition, use this option to specify whether VIOS virtual NIC group labels are to be used when determining mappings of virtual NICs when specific virtual NIC mappings are not specified.

When  performing  a  clean  up  operation  after  a  successful  remote  restart  of  a  partition  using  a reserved storage device, specify this option to prevent the reserved storage device assigned to the partition from being removed from the reserved storage device pool on the source managed system.

This option is only valid when performing a clean up operation.

## --usecurrdata

Specify this option to allow a partition to be remotely restarted when the partition configuration data saved in the remote restart data for the partition does not match the current configuration of the partition. The partition will be remotely restarted with the saved configuration data.

This option must be used to remotely restart a partition when the remote restart state of the partition is Local Storage Update Failed, Forced Source Side Restart, or Stale Data.

This option is only valid when performing a remote restart operation.

## --noconnection

Specify this option to allow a   partition to be remotely restarted when the source managed system is in the No Connection state.

## auto\_cleanup\_enabled

Automatic clean up of remotely restarted partitions can be performed on the source managed system once the source managed system is in Operating state and all of the VIOS partitions that were hosting client virtual SCSI and virtual fibre channel adapters for the remotely restarted partitions are running with RMC connections to the HMC.

Valid values are:

- 0 - this HMC is not to perform automatic clean up
- 1 - this HMC is to perform automatic clean up (default)

Input data for this command can be specified with this option or the -i option.  The -f and the -i options are mutually exclusive.

Input data can be specified when remotely restarting partitions, validating partition remote restart operations,  or  performing  a  set  operation. This  option  is  not  valid  when  performing  any other operation.

- -i This  option  allows  you  to  enter  input  data  on  the  command  line,  instead  of  using  a  file.  Data entered on the command line must follow the same format as data in a file, and must be enclosed in double quotes.

Input data for this command can be specified with this option or the -f option.  The -i and the -f options are mutually exclusive.

Input data can be specified when remotely restarting partitions, validating partition remote restart operations,  or  performing  a  set  operation. This  option  is  not  valid  when  performing  any other operation.

When performing a simplified remote restart operation for a suspended partition, you must specify this option. A suspended partition will be restarted (resumed) on the destination managed system therefore it will not remain suspended.

- -v Specify this option to enable verbose mode for the partition remote restart operation. When verbose mode is enabled, detail messages and warning messages are displayed for a successful partition remote restart operation. Detail messages and warning messages are displayed for partition remote restart operation that fails, regardless of whether this option is specified.

When the --nodetails option is also specified, no detail messages are displayed.

## --nodetails

Specify this option to suppress the display of all detail messages.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXIT STATUS

This command has the following return codes:

- 0 Success
- 93 This value is returned when remote restart validation was successful, with the exception of virtual fibre channel adapter and storage validation which could not be performed because the partition was active on the source system.

Any other value means the command failed.

- -h The host name or IP address of the remote server.

This option is required when restoring data from a remote FTP site, SFTP site, or NFS file system. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP site.

This  option  is  required  when  restoring  data  from  a  remote  FTP  or  SFTP  site. Otherwise,  this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP site.

If  this  option  is  omitted  and  the  data  is  being  restored  from  a  remote  FTP  site,  you  will  be prompted to enter the password.  If both this option and the -k option are omitted and the data is being  restored  from  a  remote  SFTP  site,  you  will  be  prompted  to  enter  the  password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when restoring data from a remote FTP or SFTP site.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If  both  this  option  and  the --passwd option  are  omitted  and  the  data  is  being  restored  from  a remote SFTP site, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when restoring the data from a remote SFTP site.

- -l The mount location defined on the NFS server that contains the backup data to be restored.

This option is required when restoring data from an NFS file system. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -o Options to be passed to the mount command used to mount the NFS file system that contains the backup data to be restored. The options must be enclosed in double quotes.

The HMC supports NFS versions 3 and 4, and this command uses version 3 by default.  To use version 4, include the option vers=4 .

This option is only valid when restoring data from an NFS file system.

- -d The name of the directory on the remote server that contains the backup data to be restored. If this option is not specified when restoring data from a remote FTP or SFTP site, it will default to the user's home directory. If this option is not specified when restoring data from an NFS file system, it will default to the mount-location on the NFS server.

This option is only valid when restoring data from a remote FTP site, SFTP site, or NFS file system.

- -f The name of the backup data file to restore.

This option is only valid when restoring data from a remote FTP site, SFTP site, or NFS file system.

- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

To restore memory or processing resources: rsthwres -r { mem | proc } -m managed-system [{ -p partition-name | --id partition-ID }] To restore physical I/O slots: rsthwres -r io -m managed-system [{ -p partition-name | --id partition-ID }] [ -l slot-DRC-index ] To restore Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) resources: rsthwres -r sriov -m managed-system [{ -p partition-name | --id partition-ID }] [ -l adapter-ID ] [ --logport logical-port-ID ]

## DESCRIPTION

rsthwres restores the hardware resource configuration of partitions in the managed-system . This operation may need to be performed after a dynamic logical partitioning (DLPAR) operation fails.

## OPTIONS

- -r The type of hardware resources to restore. Valid values are mem for memory, proc for processing resources, io for  physical  I/O  slots,  and sriov for  Single  Root  I/O  Virtualization  (SR-IOV) resources.
- -m The  name  of  the  managed  system  which  has  the  partitions  for  which  to  restore  the  hardware resources.  The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.
- -p The name of the partition for which to restore the hardware resources.

To restore hardware resources for a single partition, you must either use this option to specify the name of the partition, or use the --id option to  specify  the  partition's ID.  Otherwise, hardware resources for all partitions in the managed-system will be restored.

The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the partition for which to restore the hardware resources.

To restore hardware resources for a single partition, you must either use this option to specify the ID  of  the  partition,  or  use  the -p option  to  specify  the  partition's name.  Otherwise, hardware resources for all partitions in the managed-system will be restored.

The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

- -l When restoring physical I/O slots, specify the DRC index of the physical I/O slot to restore. If this option is omitted and a partition is specified with the -p or --id option, then all physical I/O slots assigned to the specified partition will be restored. If this option is omitted and a partition is not specified, then all physical I/O slots in the managed-system will be restored.

When restoring SR-IOV resources, specify the adapter ID of the SR-IOV adapter to restore. If this option is omitted, then all the SR-IOV resources for the specified partitions on the managed system will be included in the restore.

## --logport

The ID of the SR-IOV logical port to restore.

When restoring SR-IOV resources, if this option is omitted, then all the SR-IOV logical ports for the specified SR-IOV adapters and partitions will be included in the restore.

Display the help text for this command and exit.

[ -h host-name -u user-ID [ --passwd password ] [ -k SSH-private-key ]]

[ -d remote-directory ] [ --migrate ] [ -i additional-data ] [ --force ]

[ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

saveupgdata saves the  current  partition  profile  data,  Hardware  Management  Console  (HMC)  user  data, and HMC configuration data in a portion of the HMC hard drive that the HMC upgrade process cannot erase. The HMC automatically recovers the data after the upgrade process completes.

Optionally this command can also save the upgrade data to a USB data storage device or on a remote FTP or  secure  FTP  (SFTP)  server. The rstupgdata command can be used to restore the saved upgrade data manually after upgrading the HMC.

This command should be run immediately prior to performing an HMC upgrade. If the HMC is restarted without performing an upgrade after running this command, this command must be run again.

This command in conjunction with the rstupgdata command can be used to facilitate migration from one HMC to another. Both commands must be run with the --migrate option.

## OPTIONS

- -r If disk is specified, upgrade data will only be saved on the HMC hard drive.

If diskusb is specified, in addition to storing the upgrade data on the HMC hard drive, this command will copy the same upgrade data onto a USB data storage device.  The USB device must be inserted into a USB port on the HMC before running this command.

If diskftp is specified, in addition to storing the upgrade data on the HMC hard drive, this command will copy the same upgrade data to an FTP server.

If disksftp is specified, in addition to storing the upgrade data on the HMC hard drive, this command will copy the same upgrade data to a secure FTP server.

- -h The host name or IP address of the remote server where the upgrade data will be saved.

updhmc - update the Hardware Management Console

## SYNOPSIS

updhmc -t { disk | dvd | ftp | sftp | nfs | usb | ibmwebsite }

[ -h host-name ] [ -u user-ID ] [ --passwd password ] [ -k SSH-private-key ]

[ -l mount-location ] [ -o mount-command-options ]

[ -f file ] [ --ptf PTF-number ] [ -r ] [ -c ] [ -n device-name ] [ --help

## DESCRIPTION

updhmc updates the Hardware Management Console (HMC) by installing a corrective service package.

## OPTIONS

- -t The type of location which contains the corrective service ISO image. Valid values are disk for the HMC hard disk, dvd for a DVD drive, ftp for an FTP site, sftp for a secure FTP (SFTP) site, nfs for an NFS file system, usb for a USB data storage device, or ibmwebsite for the IBM Fix Central website.

To  install a corrective service package located on a USB data storage device, the device must be connected to the HMC and must be mounted with the mount command before this command is issued.  The lsmediadev command can be used to display the mount point for the USB device.

To  install  a  corrective  service  package  located  on  a  virtual  media  device,  specify usb with  this option for the Power HMC CR2, otherwise specify dvd with this option.

- -h The  host  name  or  IP  address  of  the  remote  server  where  the  corrective  service  ISO  image  is located.

This option is required when the ISO image is located on a remote FTP, SFTP, or NFS server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP server.

This option is required when the ISO image is located on a remote FTP or SFTP server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP server.

If this option is omitted and the corrective service ISO image is located on a remote FTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  If both this option and the -k option are omitted and the  corrective  service  ISO  image  is  located  on  a  remote  SFTP  server, you will  be  prompted  to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

This option is only valid when the ISO image is located on a remote FTP or SFTP server.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If  both this option and the --passwd option are omitted and the corrective service ISO image is located  on  a  remote  SFTP  server, you  will  be  prompted  to  enter  the  password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

-p VIOS-name | --id VIOS-ID } --disk disk-names

[ -h host-name ] [ -u user-ID ] [ --passwd password ] [ -k SSH-private-key ]

[ -d directory ] [ -l mount-location ] [ --options " mount-command-options " ]

--device device-name ] [ --save ] [ --help ]

{ [ -n image-name ] [ -f files ] [

## DESCRIPTION

upgvios upgrades a Virtual I/O Server (VIOS).

The VIOS will be restarted during the upgrade.

## OPTIONS

- -r The repository that contains the VIOS installation image. Valid values are disk for the Hardware Management Console (HMC) hard disk, nfs for an NFS file system, sftp for a secure FTP (SFTP) server, and usb for a USB data storage device.
- -m The name of the managed system which has the VIOS to upgrade. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is  the  model, and sssssss is  the  serial  number of the managed system. The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same userdefined name.
- -p The name of the VIOS to upgrade.

You must either use this option to specify the name of the VIOS or use the --id option to specify the ID of the VIOS. The -p and --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the VIOS to upgrade.

You must either use this option to specify the ID of the VIOS or use the -p option to specify the name of the VIOS. The --id and -p options are mutually exclusive.

- --disk The name of one or more free VIOS disks to be used for the upgrade. Multiple disk names must be comma separated. The total of the specified disk sizes must be a minimum of 30 GB.
- -n The name of the VIOS installation image.

When the VIOS installation image is on the HMC hard disk, this option is required to specify the name of the installation image.

When the VIOS installation image is on a remote server or a USB data storage device and the --save option is specified, this option is required to specify the name used to save the image to the HMC hard disk.

- -f When the VIOS installation image is on a remote server, use this option to specify the installation image file names. 1 or 2 ISO file names must be specified. Multiple file names must be comma separated.

This option is required and only valid when the VIOS installation image is on a remote server.

- -h The host name or IP address of the remote server.
- -u The user ID to use to log in to the remote SFTP server.

This option is required when the VIOS installation image is on a remote SFTP server. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --passwd

The password to use to log in to the remote SFTP server.

If both this option and the -k option are omitted when the VIOS installation image is on a remote SFTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The --passwd and -k options are mutually exclusive.

- -k The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. If the file name is not fully qualified, the file must exist in the user's home directory on the HMC.

Use the ssh-keygen command to generate the public and private SSH key pair. The ssh-keygen command is not allowed to write to the .ssh directory in the user's home directory on the HMC, so when you run the command on the HMC, you must specify both the directory and the file name for the private key. If you generate a key with a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase when you run any HMC command that uses the key.

If both this option and the --passwd option are omitted when the VIOS installation image is on a remote SFTP server, you will be prompted to enter the password.  The -k and --passwd options are mutually exclusive.

- -l The mount location defined on the NFS server that contains the VIOS installation image.

This option is required when the VIOS installation image is in an NFS file system. Otherwise, this option is not valid.

## --options

Options to be passed to the mount command used to mount the NFS file system that contains the VIOS installation image. The options must be enclosed in double quotes.

The HMC supports NFS versions 3 and 4, and this command uses version 3 by default.  To use version 4, include the option vers=4 .

This option is only valid when the VIOS installation image is in an NFS file system.

- -d The name of the directory on the remote server that contains the VIOS installation image. If this option is not specified when the VIOS installation image is on a SFTP server, the image will be obtained from the user's home directory. If this option is not specified when the VIOS installation image is in an NFS file system, the image will be obtained from the mount-location on the NFS server.

## --device

When the VIOS installation image is on a USB data storage device, use this option to specify the name of the USB device on the HMC. The USB device must be connected to the HMC and must be mounted with the mount command before this command is run. The lsmediadev command can be used to display the device name of the USB device once it has been connected to the HMC.

- --save Specify this option to save the VIOS installation image on the HMC hard disk.
- --help Display the help text for this command and exit.

## EXAMPLES

Upgrade VIOS vios1 using a VIOS installation image from the HMC hard disk:

upgvios -m sys1 -p vios1 --disk hdisk6 -r disk -n VIOS\_4.1.0.00

Upgrade VIOS vios1 using a VIOS installation image from a remote SFTP server, and use SSH keys for authentication:

upgvios -m sys1 -p vios1 --disk hdisk2,hdisk3 -r sftp -h sftpserver

## -u sftpuser -k /home/hmcuser/keys/id\_rsa -d vios/upgrade/VIOS\_3.1.4.00 -f dvdimage.iso

Upgrade the VIOS with ID 1 using a VIOS installation image from a remote SFTP server (you will be prompted for the password).  Save the image on the HMC hard disk:

## upgvios -m 9080-HEX*1234567 --id 1 --disk hdisk1 -r sftp -n VIOS\_3.1.4.00 --save -h sftpserver -u sftpuser -d vios/upgrade/VIOS\_3.1.4.00 -f dvdimage.v1.iso,dvdimage.v2.iso

Upgrade the VIOS vios1 using a VIOS installation image from an NFS file system, and use NFS version 4:

## updvios -m sys1 -p vios1 --disk hdisk9,hdisk10 -r nfs -h 9.3.145.52 -l /images --options "vers=4" -d vios/upgrade/VIOS\_IMAGE -f dvdimage.iso

Upgrade the VIOS with ID 1 using a VIOS installation image from a USB data storage device (the USB data storage device must already be connected to the HMC):

## lsmediadev

(to obtain mount point/device name)

## mount /dev/sdb1

## NAME

viosvrcmd - run Virtual I/O Server command

## SYNOPSIS

viosvrcmd -m managed-system { -p partition-name | --id partition-ID } -c " command " [ -t timeout ] [ --admin ] [ --help ]

## DESCRIPTION

viosvrcmd runs an I/O server command line interface (ioscli) command on a Virtual I/O Server (VIOS).

The ioscli commands are passed from the Hardware Management Console (HMC) to the VIOS over an RMC session. RMC does not allow interactive execution of ioscli commands.

## OPTIONS

-m The name of the managed system which has the VIOS on which to run the command. The name may either be the user-defined name for the managed system, or be in the form tttt -mmm * sssssss , where tttt is the machine type, mmm is the model, and sssssss is the serial number of the managed system.  The tttt -mmm * sssssss form must be used if there are multiple managed systems with the same user-defined name.

- -p The name of the VIOS partition on which to run the command.

You must either use this option to specify the name of the partition, or use the --id option to specify the partition's ID.  The -p and the --id options are mutually exclusive.

- --id The ID of the VIOS partition on which to run the command.

You must either use this option to specify the ID of the partition, or use the -p option to specify the partition's name.  The --id and the -p options are mutually exclusive.

- -c The I/O server command line interface (ioscli) command to run on the VIOS. command must be enclosed in double quotes.
- -t The maximum time, in minutes, to wait for the VIOS command to complete. The following timeout values are supported: 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 120 minutes. If any other value less than 120 is specified, the value is rounded up to the next supported value.  If a value greater than 120 is specified, the command will fail with an error.

If this option is not specified, the timeout value defaults to 10 minutes.

Specify this option to run the command as root on the VIOS. The HMC will run oem\_setup\_env immediately before running command .

Only  HMC users with  the ViosAdminOp task  in  their  task  roles  are  authorized  to  specify  the --admin option.  Either the mkaccfg or the chaccfg command must be used to add the ViosAdminOp task to a task role. The ViosAdminOp task can only be added to custom task roles that are based on the hmcoperator or hmcsuperadmin task role. None of the pre-defined task roles, including the hmcoperator and hmcsuperadmin task roles, contain the ViosAdminOp task.

Display the help text for this command and exit.

## --admin
