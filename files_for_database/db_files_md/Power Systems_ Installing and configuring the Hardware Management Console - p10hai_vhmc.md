CAUTION: Regarding IBM provided VENDOR LIFT TOOL:

- Operation of LIFT TOOL by authorized personnel only.
- LIFT TOOL intended for use to assist, lift, install, remove units (load) up into rack elevations. It is not to be used loaded transporting over major ramps nor as a replacement for such designated tools like pallet jacks, walkies, fork trucks and such related relocation practices. When this is not practicable, specially trained persons or services must be used (for instance, riggers or movers).
- Read and completely understand the contents of LIFT TOOL operator's manual before using. Failure to read, understand, obey safety rules, and follow instructions may result in property damage and/or personal injury. If there are questions, contact the vendor's service and support. Local paper manual must remain with machine in provided storage sleeve area. Latest revision manual available on vendor's web site.
- Test verify stabilizer brake function before each use. Do not over-force moving or rolling the LIFT TOOL with stabilizer brake engaged.
- Do not raise, lower or slide platform load shelf unless stabilizer (brake pedal jack) is fully engaged. Keep stabilizer brake engaged when not in use or motion.
- Do not move LIFT TOOL while platform is raised, except for minor positioning.
- Do not exceed rated load capacity. See LOAD CAPACITY CHART regarding maximum loads at center versus edge of extended platform.
- Only raise load if properly centered on platform. Do not place more than 200 lb (91 kg) on edge of sliding platform shelf also considering the load's center of mass/gravity (CoG).
- Do not corner load the platforms, tilt riser, angled unit install wedge or other such accessory options. Secure such platforms -- riser tilt, wedge, etc options to main lift shelf or forks in all four (4x or all other provisioned mounting) locations with provided hardware only, prior to use. Load objects are designed to slide on/off smooth platforms without appreciable force, so take care not to push or lean. Keep riser tilt [adjustable angling platform] option flat at all times except for fi nal minor angle adjustment when needed.
- Do not stand under overhanging load.
- Do not use on uneven surface, incline or decline (major ramps).
- Do not stack loads.
- Do not operate while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
- Do not support ladder against LIFT TOOL (unless the speci fi c allowance is provided for one following quali fi ed procedures for working at elevations with this TOOL).
- Tipping hazard. Do not push or lean against load with raised platform.
- Do not use as a personnel lifting platform or step. No riders.
- Do not stand on any part of lift. Not a step.
- Do not climb on mast.
- Do not operate a damaged or malfunctioning LIFT TOOL machine.
- Crush and pinch point hazard below platform. Only lower load in areas clear of personnel and obstructions. Keep hands and feet clear during operation.
- No Forks. Never lift or move bare LIFT TOOL MACHINE with pallet truck, jack or fork lift.
- Mast extends higher than platform. Be aware of ceiling height, cable trays, sprinklers, lights, and other overhead objects.
- Do not leave LIFT TOOL machine unattended with an elevated load.
- Watch and keep hands, fi ngers, and clothing clear when equipment is in motion.

- Turn Winch with hand power only. If winch handle cannot be cranked easily with one hand, it is probably over-loaded. Do not continue to turn winch past top or bottom of platform travel. Excessive unwinding will detach handle and damage cable. Always hold handle when lowering, unwinding. Always assure self that winch is holding load before releasing winch handle.
- A winch accident could cause serious injury. Not for moving humans. Make certain clicking sound is heard as the equipment is being raised. Be sure winch is locked in position before releasing handle. Read instruction page before operating this winch. Never allow winch to unwind freely. Freewheeling will cause uneven cable wrapping around winch drum, damage cable, and may cause serious injury.
- This TOOL must be maintained correctly for IBM Service personnel to use it. IBM shall inspect condition and verify maintenance history before operation. Personnel reserve the right not to use TOOL if inadequate. (C048)

9. From the Multiboot menu, select 1 = Select Install/Boot Device .
10. From the Select Device Type menu, select 5 = List all devices .
11. Select the HMCInstall device based on the device location.
12. Select 3. Service Mode Boot .
13. Select 1. Yes to con fi rm.
14. Select Install Hardware Management Console (PowerVM) .

15. Follow the onscreen instructions from the HMCInstall wizard.

Note: Skip this step if you used an automated HMC installation image.

16. After the installation completes and the system starts, you must select a language from the language selection dialog box.
17. Accept the license agreement.

Note: Ensure that the command controller is ready to accept commands before you run any commands. For example, running the lshmc -V command until it succeeds.

18. Log in as hscroot and use the chhmc command to con fi gure the network.

The following example shows the sequence of chhmc commands that can be used to con fi gure the network and enable Secure Shell (SSH) and remote web access on the HMC.

```
chhmc -c network -s modify -i ethX -a <hmc ip address> -nm <hmc network mask> --lparcomm on chhmc -c network -s modify -h <hmc hostname> -d <hmc domain name> -g <gateway ip> chhmc -c network -s add -ns <name server> -ds <domain search> chhmc -c ssh -s enable chhmc -c ssh.name -s add -a <ip address> chhmc -c SecureRemoteAccess.name -s add -a <ip address> chhmc -c remotewebui -s enable -i ethX hmcshutdown -r -t now
```

- ethX is the network interface name to con fi gure.
- hmc ip address is the IP address of your HMC.
- hmc network mask is the network mask of your HMC.
- hmc hostname is the host name of your HMC.
- hmc domain name is the domain name of your HMC.
- gateway ip is the IP address of the gateway on your network.
- name server is the name server address of your network.
- domain search is the names of the domains that you want the HMC to search on.
- To allow access on all IP addresses, use -a 0.0.0.0 -nm 0 in place of ip address .

Note: When you use multiple virtual Ethernet adapters, run the command cat /etc/sysconfig/ network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX on the HMC virtual appliance on each interface. Compare the media access control (MAC) address against what the HMC shows in the adapter view of the virtual network of the partition. You can click View Virtual Ethernet Adapter Settings for more information on the virtual Ethernet adapters. This step helps you determine the correct interface to use.

19. Restart the system.

## Using the Activation Engine for the HMC virtual appliance

Learn how to use the Activation Engine for the Hardware Management Console (HMC) virtual appliance.

Activation Engine is a framework that allows various components within a virtual machine to be con fi gured during system startup. To use the Activation Engine, you need to set up an XML con fi guration pro fi le to allow the HMC virtual appliance to be in a ready-to-manage state on fi rst start. For more information about con fi guring the XML con fi guration pro fi le, see 'Setting up the con fi guration pro fi le for the Activation Engine' on page 14. The con fi guration fi le can be used to con fi gure the following options:

- Set Default Keyboard (US)
- Default Locale (US)
- Disable Keyboard Setup
- Disable Display Setup
- License Agreement and Machine Code Agreement
- Disable Setup Wizard
- Disable Call Home Wizard

- Con fi gure up to four Network Interface Cards
- Con fi gure Firewall Settings for each Interface
- Con fi gure Network interface as IPv4 DHCP Server
- Con fi gure Private and Open Interface
- Con fi gure Default Gateway Interface Device

Note: The number of Ethernet adapters that is de fi ned in the vHMC-Conf.xml con fi guration fi le must correlate with the de fi ned Network adapters in the domain.xml , vHMC.cfg , or VMWare con fi guration fi le.

The Activation Engine requires a virtual disk that holds an XML con fi guration. You can edit the user\_data fi le with a text editor and use the XML con fi guration guide that is shown in the following example.

To create a virtual ISO disk image with Activation Engine con fi guration in a Linux environment, complete the following steps:

1. Create a directory:

```
mkdir -p config-drive/openstack/latest 2. Copy the edited user_data fi le into the directory: cp user_data config-drive/openstack/latest 3. Create a virtual disk image with the Activation Engine con fi guration: mkisofs -R -V config-2 -o AEdrive.iso config-drive
```

## Setting up the con fi guration pro fi le for the Activation Engine

Learn how to set up the Activation Engine con fi guration fi le by using XML tags.

## Con fi guration fi le

Use the following example of the con fi guration fi le to learn about the XML tags.

## Con fi guring the HMC

Learn how to set up your network connections, con fi gure your HMC, complete postcon fi guration steps, and upgrade and update your HMC.

## Choosing network settings on the HMC

Learn about the network settings that you can use on the Hardware Management Console (HMC).

## HMCnetwork connections

Learn how the Hardware Management Console HMC can be used in a network.

You can use different types of network connections to connect your HMC to managed systems. For more information about using the HMC on a network, see the following information:

## Types of HMC network connections

Learn how to use the HMC remote management and service functions by using your network.

The HMC supports the following types of logical communications:

## HMCto managed system

Used to perform most of the hardware management functions, in which HMC issues control function requests through the service processor of the managed system. The connection between the HMC and the service processor is sometimes referred to as the service network . This connection is required for managed system management.

## HMCto logical partition

Used to collect platform-related information (hardware error events, hardware inventory) from the operating systems that are running on logical partitions, and to coordinate certain platform activities (dynamic LPAR, concurrent repair) with those operating systems. If you want to use service and error noti fi cation features, you must create this connection.

## HMCto BMC

Note: The baseboard management controller (BMC) connection is applicable only to HMC model 7063-CR1.

Used to perform service and maintenance tasks. The BMC connection is used to load and maintain the HMC fi rmware on the system. This connection is required for access to the BMC on the HMC.

## HMCto remote users

Provides remote users with access to HMC functions. Remote users can access the HMC in the following ways:

- By using the web browser to access all the HMC GUI functions remotely.
- By using Secure Socket Shell (SSH) to access the HMC command line functions remotely.
- By using a virtual terminal server for remote access to virtual logical partition consoles.

## HMCto service and support

Used to transmit data, such as hardware error reports, inventory data, and microcode updates, to and from your service provider. You can use this communications path to make automatic service calls.

Your HMC can support up to four separate physical Ethernet interfaces, depending on the model. The stand-alone version of the HMC supports only three HMC interfaces, by using one integrated Ethernet adapter and up to two plug-in adapters. Use each of these interfaces in the following ways:

- One network interface can be used exclusively for HMC-to-managed system communications, which means that only the HMC and service processors of the managed systems would be on that network. One or more network interfaces can be used exclusively for HMC-to-managed system communications,

which means that only the HMC and service processors of the managed systems are on that network. Even though the network interfaces into the service processors are encrypted for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol and password-protected, having a separate dedicated network can provide a higher level of security for these interfaces.

- An open network interface would typically be used for the network connection between the HMC and the logical partitions on the managed systems, for the HMC-to-logical partition communications. You can also use this open network interface to manage the HMC remotely.
- Optionally, you can use a third interface to connect to logical partitions and manage the HMC remotely. This interface can also be used as a separate HMC connection to different groups of logical partitions. For example, you might want to have an administrative LAN that is separate from the LAN on which all the usual business transactions are running. Remote administrators can access the HMC and other managed units by using this method. Sometimes the logical partitions are in different Network security domains, perhaps behind a fi rewall, and you might want to have different HMC network connections into each of those two domains.

## Web browser requirements for HMC

The Hardware Management Console (HMC) version 9.1.0 is supported by Google Chrome version 57, Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 11.0, Mozilla Firefox versions 45 and 52 Extended Support Release (ESR), and Safari version 10.1.

If your browser is con fi gured to use an Internet proxy, a local IP addresses should be included in the exception list. Consult your network administrator for more information on the exception list. If you still need to use the proxy to get to the HMC, enable Use HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections under the Advanced tab in your Internet Options window.

Session cookies need to be enabled in order for ASMI to work when connected to HMC remotely. The asm proxy code saves session information and uses it. Follow the steps to enable the session cookies.

## Private and open networks in the HMC environment

The Hardware Management Console (HMC) can be con fi gured to use open and private networks. Private networks allow the use of a selected range of nonroutable IP addresses. A public , or "open" network describes a network connection between the HMC to any logical partitions and to other systems on your regular network.

## Private networks

The only devices on the HMC private network are the HMC itself and each of the managed systems to which that HMC is connected. The HMC is connected to each managed system's Flexible Service Processor (FSP).

On most systems, the FSP provides two Ethernet ports that are labeled HMC1 and HMC2 . You to connect up to two HMCs.

Some systems have a dual-FSP option. In this situation, the second FSP acts as a redundant backup. The basic setup requirements for a system with two FSPs are essentially the same as a system without a second FSP. The HMC must be connected to each FSP, so more network hardware is required (for example, a LAN switch or hub) when there is more than one FSP or multiple managed systems.

Note: Each FSP port on the managed system must be connected to only one HMC.

## Public networks

The open network can be connected to a fi rewall or router for connecting to the internet. Connecting to the internet allows the HMC to call home when any hardware errors need to be reported.

The HMC itself provides its own fi rewall on each of its network interfaces. A basic fi rewall is automatically con fi gured when you run the HMC Guided Setup wizard, but you customize your fi rewall settings after the initial HMC installation and con fi guration.

## HMC as a DHCP server

You can use the Hardware Management Console (HMC) as a Dynamic Host Con fi guration Protocol (DHCP) server.

If you want to con fi gure the fi rst network interface as a private network, you can select from a range of IP addresses for the DHCP server to assign to its clients. The selectable address ranges include segments from the standard nonroutable IP address ranges.

In addition to these standard ranges, a special range of IP addresses is reserved for IP addresses. This special range can be used to avoid conflicts in cases where the HMC attached open networks are using one of the nonroutable address ranges. Based on the range that is selected, the HMC network interface on the private network is automatically assigned the fi rst IP address of that range. The service processors are then assigned addresses from the rest of the range.

The DHCP server in the HMC uses automatic allocation, which means that each unique service processor Ethernet interface is reassigned the same IP address each time it is started. Each Ethernet interface has a unique identi fi er that is based on a built-in Media Access Control (MAC) address, which allows the DHCP server to reassign the same IP parameters. You can con fi gure both eth0 and eth1 HMC ports to serve DHCP addresses.

Figure 1. Private network with one HMC as a DHCP server

<!-- image -->

Note: If you are using IPv6, the discovery process must be done manually. For IPv6, automatic discovery is not available.

For more information about how to con fi gure the HMC as a DHCP server, see 'Con fi guring the HMC as a DHCP server' on page 45.

<!-- image -->

This fi gure shows a redundant HMC environment with two managed systems. The fi rst HMC is connected to the fi rst port on each FSP, and the redundant HMC is connected to the second port on each HMC. Each HMC is con fi gured as a DHCP server, by using a different range of IP addresses. The connections are on

separate private networks. As such, it is important to ensure that no FSP port is connected to more than one HMC.

Each managed system's FSP port that is connected to an HMC requires a unique IP address. To ensure that each FSP has a unique IP address, use the HMC's built-in DHCP server capability. When the FSP detects the active network link, it issues a broadcast request to locate a DHCP server. When correctly con fi gured, the HMC responds to that request by allocating one of a selected range of addresses.

If you have multiple FSPs, you must have your own LAN switch or hub for the HMC to FSP private network. Alternately, this private segment can exist as several ports in a private virtual LAN (VLAN) on a larger managed switch. If you have multiple private VLANs, you must ensure that they are isolated and without any crossover traf fi c.

If you have more than one HMC, you must also connect each HMC to the logical partitions, and to each other, on the same open network.

<!-- image -->

This fi gure shows two HMCs connected to a single managed server on the private network, and to three logical partitions on the public network. You can have an extra Ethernet adapter for the HMC to have three network interfaces. You can use this third network as a management network or connect it to the CSM (Cluster Systems Manager) Management Server.

## Deciding which connectivity method to use for the call-home server

Learn more about the connectivity options you have when you use the call-home server.

You can con fi gure the Hardware Management Console (HMC) to send hardware service-related information to IBM by using a LAN-based internet connection, or a dial-up connection over a modem.

You have two communication choices when you con fi gure the LAN-based internet connection. The fi rst choice is to use standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The SSL communication can be enabled to connect to the internet through your proxy server. SSL connectivity is more likely to be compliant with corporate security guidelines.

Note: If your open network interface connection uses only Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), you cannot use internet VPN to connect to support. For more information about the protocols that are used, see 'Choosing an Internet Protocol' on page 27.

The advantages to using an internet connection can include:

- Faster transmission speed
- Reduced customer expense (for example, the cost of a dedicated analog telephone line)
- Greater reliability

The following security characteristics are in effect, regardless of the connectivity method chosen:

- Remote Support Facility requests are always initiated from the HMC to IBM. An inbound connection is never initiated from the IBM Service Support System.
- All data that is transferred between the HMC and the IBM Service Support System are encrypted by using a high-grade encryption. Depending upon the connectivity method that is chosen, it is encrypted by using either SSL or IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
- When you initialize the encrypted connection, the HMC authenticates the target destination as the IBM Service Support System.

Data sent to the IBM Service Support System consists solely of information about hardware problems and con fi guration. No application or customer data is transmitted to IBM.

## Using an indirect internet connection with a proxy server

If your installation requires the HMC to be on a private network, you might be able to connect indirectly to the internet by using an SSL proxy, which can forward requests to the internet. One of the other potential advantages of using an SSL proxy is that the proxy can support logging and audit facilities.

To forward SSL sockets, the proxy server must support the basic proxy header functions (as described in RFC 2616) and the CONNECT method. Optionally, basic proxy authentication (RFC 2617) can be con fi gured so that the HMC authenticates before you attempt to forward sockets through the proxy server.

<!-- image -->

For the HMC to communicate successfully, the client's proxy server must allow connections to port 443. You can con fi gure your proxy server to limit the speci fi c IP addresses to which the HMC can connect. See 'Internet SSL address lists' on page 27 for a list of IP addresses.

## Using a direct internet SSL connection

If your HMC can be connected to the internet, and the external fi rewall can be set up to allow established TCP packets to flow outbound to the destinations described in 'Internet SSL address lists' on page 27, you can use a direct internet connection.

<!-- image -->

## Using internet SSL to connect to remote support

All the communications are handled through TCP sockets that are initiated by the Hardware Management Console (HMC) and use a high-grade SSL to encrypt the data that is transmitted. The destination TCP/IP addresses are published (see 'Internet SSL address lists' on page 27) so that external fi rewalls can be con fi gured to allow these connections.

Note: The standard HTTPS port 443 is used for all communications.

The HMC can be enabled to connect directly to the internet or to connect indirectly from a proxy server that is provided by the customer. The decision about which approach is best for your installation depends on the security and networking requirements of your enterprise. The HMC (directly or through the SSL proxy) uses the following addresses when it is con fi gured to use internet SSL connectivity.

## Choosing an Internet Protocol

Determine the IP address version that is used when the Hardware Management Console (HMC) connects to your service provider.

Most users use Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) to connect to a service provider. IPv4 addresses appear in the format that represents the 4 bytes of the IPv4 address, which is separated by periods (for example, 9.60.12.123) to access the internet. You can also use Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) to connect to a service provider. IPv6 is often used by network administrators to ensure unique address space. If you are unsure of the Internet Protocol used by your installation, contact your network administrator. For more information about using each version, see 'Setting the IPv4 address' on page 46 and 'Setting the IPv6 address' on page 47.

## Internet SSL address lists

Learn about the addresses that the Hardware Management Console (HMC) uses when the HMC is using internet SSL connectivity.

The HMC uses the following IPv4 addresses to contact IBM service and support when it is con fi gured to use internet SSL connectivity.

The following IPv4 addresses are for all locations:

- 129.42.26.224
- 129.42.42.224
- 129.42.50.224
- 129.42.56.216
- 129.42.58.216

- 129.42.60.216
- 170.225.15.41

The following IPv4 addresses are for the Americas:

- 129.42.160.48
- 129.42.160.49
- 207.25.252.197
- 207.25.252.200
- 207.25.252.204

The following IPv4 addresses are for all locations other than the Americas:

- 129.42.160.48
- 129.42.160.50
- 207.25.252.197
- 207.25.252.200
- 207.25.252.205

Note: When you con fi gure a fi rewall to allow an HMC to connect to these servers, only the IP addresses speci fi c to the geographic region are required.

The HMC uses the following IPv6 addresses to contact IBM service and support when it is con fi gured to use internet SSL connectivity:

- 2620:0:6C0:1::1000
- 2620:0:6C2:1::1000
- 2620:0:6C4:1::1000

## Using multiple call-home servers

Learn about what you need to know when you decide to use more than one call-home server.

To avoid a single point of failure, con fi gure the Hardware Management Console (HMC) to use multiple call-home servers. The fi rst available call-home server attempts to handle each service event. If the connection or transmission fails with this call-home server, the service request is retried by using the other available call-home servers until one is successful or all servers are tried.

The connected HMC that is identi fi ed by the problem analysis to be the primary analyzing console for a given managed system that reports the problem. This primary console also replicates the problem report to any secondary HMC. This secondary HMC must be recognized on the network by the primary HMC. A secondary HMC is recognized by the primary HMC as an extra call-home server when:

- The primary HMC is con fi gured to use "discovered" call-home servers and the call-home server is either on the same subnet as the primary HMC or it manages the same system.
- The call-home server is manually added to the list of call-home server consoles available for outbound connectivity.

## Preparing for HMC con fi guration

Learn about the required con fi guration settings that you need to know before you begin the con fi guration steps.

To con fi gure the HMC, you must understand the related concepts, make decisions, and prepare information.

Learn about the information that you need to connect your HMC to the following locations:

- Service processors in your managed systems
- Logical partitions on those managed systems

- Remote workstations
- IBM Service to implement 'call-home' functions

To prepare for HMC con fi guration, complete the following steps:

1. Obtain and install the latest level of the HMC code version you want to install.
2. Determine the physical location of the HMC in relation to the servers it manages. If the HMC is more than 25 feet from its managed system, you must provide web browser access to the HMC from the managed system's location so that service personnel can access the HMC.
3. Identify the servers that the HMC manages.
4. Determine whether you use a private or an open network to manage servers. If you decide to use a private network, use DHCP, unless you are using a Cluster Systems Management (CSM) con fi guration. CSM does not support IPv6. To access CSM, you must have two networks. For more information about CSM, see the documentation that was provided with that feature. For more information about private and open networks, see 'Selecting a private or open network' on page 44.
5. If you use an open network to manage an FSP, you must set the FSP's address manually through the Advanced System Management Interface menus. A private, non-routable network is recommended.
6. If you have two HMCs, designate a primary and secondary HMC. The primary HMC needs be physically closer to the system, and must be the HMC that is con fi gured to call home.
7. Determine the network settings that you need to connect the HMC to remote workstations, logical partitions, and network devices.
8. De fi ne how the HMC calls home. Call home options include either over an outbound-only Secure Socket Layer (SSL) internet connection, a modem, or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection.
9. Determine the HMC users that you create and their passwords, as well which roles they are given. You must assign the hscroot and hscpe users a password.
10. Document the following company contact information that is needed when you con fi gure call home:
- Company name
- Administrator contact
- Email address
- Telephone numbers
- Fax numbers
- The street address of the HMC's physical location
11. If you plan to use email to notify operators or systems administrators when information is sent to IBM Service through call-home, identify the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server and the email addresses you use.
12. You must de fi ne the following passwords:
- The access password that is used to authenticate the HMC to the FSP.
- The ASMI password that is used for the admin user.
- The ASMI password that is used for the general user.

Create the passwords when you connect from the HMC to a new server for the fi rst time. If the HMC is a redundant or second HMC, obtain the HMC User password and be prepared to enter it when you connect the fi rst time to the managed server's FSP.

When you complete these preparation steps, complete the 'Preinstallation con fi guration worksheet for the HMC' on page 30.

## Improved password policy for HMC

You must set a new password on the fi rst use for newly manufactured systems with HMC version 9.940.0, or later, and after a factory reset of the system. This policy change helps to enforce that the HMC is not left in a state with a well-known password.

With HMC Version 9.940.0, and later, the hscroot password is expired and must be changed before you can access the functions of the HMC. For more information about how to change the password, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER10/p10eh6/p10eh6\_useridsandpassword.htm. However, if you are upgrading from a previous HMC level or an operational installation, you do not need to change the password.

## Network Settings

LAN Interface: Choose the available adapters (such as eth0, eth1) that is used by the HMC to connect to managed systems, logical partitions, service and support, and remote users. For more information, see 'HMC network connections' on page 21. Connectivity from the HMC can either be on a private or open network.

## Ethernet Adapter Speed and Duplex

Enter the wanted Ethernet adapter speed and duplex mode. The autodetection option determines which option is optimal if you are not sure which speed and duplex would produce optimum results for your hardware. Default = Autodetection Media speed speci fi es the speed in duplex mode of an Ethernet adapter. Select Autodetection unless you need to specify a fi xed media speed. Any device that is connected to the FSP (switches/HMC), must be set to Auto (Speed) / Auto (Duplex) mode, as it is the default FSP setting and cannot be changed.

## TCP/IP information

A unique TCP/IP address is required for each node, both for Support Element (SE) and Hardware Management Console (HMC). The assigned network mask is used to generate a unique address, by default, for the local private LAN. If the nodes are connected into a larger network with an administered TCP/IP address, you can specify the TCP/IP address that you want to use. The default is generated by the system.

## Firewall settings

HMC fi rewall settings create a security barrier that allows or denies access to speci fi c network applications on the HMC. You can specify these control settings individually for each physical network interface, so that you can control over which HMC network applications can be accessed on each network.

If you con fi gure at least one adapter as an Open network adapter, you must note the following additional information to enable your HMC to access the LAN:

## Local Host information

To identify your Hardware Management Console (HMC) to the network, enter the HMC's host name and domain name. Unless you are using only short host names on your network, enter a fully quali fi ed host name. Domain name example: name.yourcompany.com

## Gateway information

To de fi ne a default gateway, complete the TCP/IP address that will be used for routing IP packets. The gateway address informs each computer or network device when to send data if the target station is not on the same subnet as the source.

## DNS Enablement

The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to provide a standard naming convention for locating IPbased computers. By de fi ning DNS servers, you can use host names to identify servers and Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) rather than IP addresses.

## DNS Server Search Order

Enter the IP addresses of DNS servers to be searched for mapping the host names and IP addresses. This search order is available only when DNS is enabled.

## Domain Suf fi x Search Order

Enter the domain suf fi xes you are using. The HMC uses domain suf fi xes to append to unquali fi ed names for DNS searches. Suf fi xes are searched in the order in which they are listed. This search order is available only when DNS is enabled.

## Email noti fi cation

List email contact information if you want to be noti fi ed by email when hardware problem events occur on your system.

## Con fi guring the HMC

Learn how to con fi gure network connections, security, service applications, and some user preferences.

Depending on the level of customization you intend to apply to your HMC con fi guration, you have several options for setting up your HMC to suit your needs. The Guided Setup wizard is a tool on the HMC designed to ease the setup of the HMC. You can choose a fast path through the wizard to quickly create the recommended HMC environment, or you can choose to fully explore the available settings that the wizard guides you through. You can also perform the con fi guration steps without the aid of the wizard by Con fi guring the HMC by using the HMC menus.

Before you start, gather the required con fi guration information that you need to complete the steps successfully. See 'Preparing for HMC con fi guration' on page 28 for a list of the required information. When you are fi nished preparing, ensure that you complete the 'Preinstallation con fi guration worksheet for the HMC' on page 30 and then return to this section.

## Con fi guring the HMC by using the fast path through the Guided Setup wizard

In most cases, the HMC can be set up to operate effectively by using many of the default settings. Use this fast path checklist to prepare the HMC for service. When you complete these steps, your HMC is con fi gured as a Dynamic Host Con fi guration Protocol (DHCP) server in a private (directly connected) network.

## Con fi guring the HMC by using the menus

This section provides a complete list of all HMC con fi guration tasks, guiding you through the process of con fi guring your HMC. Choose this option if you prefer not to use the Guided Setup wizard.

You must restart your HMC for the con fi guration settings to take effect, so you might want to print this checklist and keep it with you as you con fi gure your HMC.

## Identifying the Ethernet port that is de fi ned as eth0

Your Ethernet connection to the managed server must be made by using the Ethernet port that is de fi ned as eth0 on your HMC.

If you did not install any additional Ethernet adapters in the PCI slots on your HMC, then the primaryintegrated Ethernet port is always de fi ned as eth0 or eth1 on your HMC, if you intend to use the HMC as a DHCP server for your managed systems.

If you install extra Ethernet adapters in the PCI slots, then the port that is de fi ned as eth0 depends on the location and type of Ethernet adapters that are installed.

Note: The following general rules might not apply for all con fi gurations.

The following table describes the rules for Ethernet placement by HMC type.

## Con fi guring the Events Manager for Call Home

Learn how to con fi gure the Events Manager for Call Home task. You can monitor and approve any data that is being transmitted from an HMC to IBM through this task.

The Events Manager for Call Home mode (enabled or disabled) is set by using the HMC command line interface. Enabling the Events Manager for Call Home task blocks the HMC from automatically calling home events as they occur. To prevent events that are called home without approval, all HMCs running in this environment must have the Events Manager for Call Home enabled.

To enable or disable the Events Manager for Call Home task, run the following command:

chhmc -c emch

- -s {enable | disable}

[--callhome {enable | disable}]

## [--help]

Note: Enabling the Events Manager for Call Home task holds call home events until they are approved for the call home task. If you disable the Events Manager for Call Home task, it does not automatically enable the call home feature. This setup prevents any unintended call home of data back to IBM. Choose from the following command options to set up the required con fi guration:

- To enable the Events Manager for Call Home task: chhmc -c emch -s enable
- To disable the Events Manager for Call Home task and to re-enable automatic call home: chhmc -c emch -s disable --callhome enable
- To disable the Events Manager for Call Home task and not re-enable automatic call home: chhmc -c emch -s disable --callhome disable

Ensure that the HMC can communicate with other HMCs deployed in this environment. The Events Manager for Call Home has a test connection function when an HMC is registered.

You can register the HMC with the Events Manager for Call Home. After you register the HMC, the events manager queries the registered HMC for any events that are waiting to be called home to IBM. The Events Manager shows what data is being sent back to IBM and approves these events. After approval, the Event Manager noti fi es the registered HMC that it can proceed with the call home operation.

The Events Manager for Call Home task can be run from any HMC or from multiple HMCs.

## Upgrading HMC from remote location by using network upgrade images

Learn how to upgrade the software on an HMC from a remote location by using network upgrade images.

## About this task

Learn how to upgrade the software on an HMC from a remote location by using network upgrade images.

## Procedure

1. From a computer or server with an internet connection, go to the Hardware Management Console Support and downloads website (http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/hmcl/ home.html).
2. Download the appropriate HMC V9 network images and save them on an FTP server. You cannot download these fi les directly to the HMC. You must download the image fi les to a server that accepts FTP requests.
3. Ensure that you download the following fi les:
- img2a
- img3a
- base.img
- disk1.img
- hmcnetwork fi les.sum
4. Save the upgrade data on the HMC. Run the following commands to save the upgrade data:
- To save data on both DVD and HDD, run the following commands:

mount /media/cdrom saveupgdata -r diskdvd

- To save data on the HDD, run the following command:

## saveupgdata -r disk

5. Copy the upgrade fi les to the bootable disk partition on the HMC. Run the getupgfiles command to copy the fi les.

## Example: getupgfiles -h &lt;ftp server&gt; -u &lt;user id&gt; -d &lt;remote directory&gt; Where,

- ftp server is the host name or IP address of the FTP server where you download the HMC network images.
- user id is a valid user ID on the FTP server. If you do not specify the password with the --passwd argument, you are prompted for a password.
- remote directory is the directory on your FTP server where the HMC network images are saved.
6. Restart the HMC to upgrade the code that is copied to the bootable disk partition. Run the chhmc -c altdiskboot -s enable --mode upgrade to restart the HMC.
7. Restart the HMC and start the upgrade. Run the hmcshutdown -r -t now command to start the upgrade.

## Securing the HMC

Learn how to enhance the security of your Hardware Management Console (HMC) that is based on your corporate security standards.

The default con fi guration of the HMC provides ample security for most enterprise users. With the Hardware Management Console (HMC) Version 8.4.0, or later, you can further enhance the security of the HMC that is based on your corporate security standards. To enhance the security for the HMC, you must set the HMC to a minimum of Level 1 security. You may choose Level 2 and Level 3 security depending on your environment and the corporate security requirements.

Note: Before changing the security level, check with your corporate security compliance team.

## Level 1 security

To secure the HMC (level 1 security), complete the following steps:

1. Change the prede fi ned password for the default hscroot user. For more information about password policy, see 'Enhanced password policy' on page 79.
2. If the HMC does not belong to a physically secure environment, set the grub password by running the following command: chhmc -c grubpasswd -s enable --passwd &lt;new grub password&gt;
3. If you have con fi gured the Integrated Management Module (IMM) on the HMC, set a strong IMM password.
4. Set a strong password for the admin user and general users on all servers.
5. Update the HMC with the latest released security fi xes. For more information about the security fi xes, see IBM Fix Central.

## Level 2 security

If you have multiple users, complete the following steps to enhance the security for the HMC:

1. Create an account for each user on the HMC and assign the required roles and resources to users. For more information about the various roles in the HMC, see HMC tasks, user roles, IDs, and associated commands.

Note: Ensure that you assign only the required resources and roles for users that are created on HMC. If necessary, you can also create custom roles.

2. Enable user data replication between different Hardware Management Consoles. The user data replication can be performed in Primary HMC-Secondary HMC mode or Peer-Peer mode. For more information about user data replication, see Manage Data Replication.
3. Import a certi fi cate that is signed by the Certi fi cate Authority.

## Level 3 security

If you have multiple Hardware Management Consoles and system administrators, complete the following steps to enhance the security for the HMC:

1. Use centralized authentication such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Kerberos. For more information about con fi guring LDAP, see How to Con fi gure LDAP on HMC.
2. Enable user data replication between different Hardware Management Consoles.
3. Ensure that the HMC is in NIST SP 800-131A mode so that the HMC uses only strong ciphers.
4. Block ports that are not required in the fi rewall. For information about the HMC ports that can be used, see the following table:

- Ports that are listed in the netstat command are used for internal processes only.

## Enhanced password policy

You can enforce password requirements for locally authenticated users by using the Hardware Management Console (HMC). The enhanced password policy function allows the system administrator to set password restrictions. The enhanced password policy applies to the systems in which an HMC is installed.

System administrators can use the enhanced password policy to de fi ne a single password policy for all users. The HMC provides a medium security password policy, which can be activated by the system administrators to set password restrictions. The system administrator can also choose to activate the medium security policy or a new user-de fi ned policy. The HMC medium security password policy cannot be removed from the system. The following table lists the attributes of the medium security policy and the default values.

Table 25. Password attributes for the HMC medium security password policy

| Attribute              | Description                                                                                                                  | Default value   |

Consider the following items about the HMC medium security password policy:

- The policy features for password age, login disablement and inactivity expiration are not applicable to the hscroot , hscpe , and root user IDs. The password character validation is applicable for these user IDs.
- The policy affects only the locally authenticated users that are managed by the HMC and the policy cannot be enforced on LDAP or Kerberos users.
- The HMC medium security password policy or the user-de fi ned policy allows the system administrators to set password reuse restrictions.
- The HMC medium security password is read-only and the attributes of HMC medium security password cannot be changed. You can create a new user-de fi ned password to set password restriction.

You can use the following commands to con fi gure the HMC medium security password policy:

## mkpwdpolicy

Imports the password policy from a fi le, which contains all the parameters, or creates a password policy.

## lspwdpolicy

Lists all the available password policy pro fi les and searches for speci fi c parameters. You can also view the password policy that is currently active.

## rmpwdpolicy

Removes an existing inactive password policy.

Note: You cannot remove an active medium security policy and the default read-only password policy.

## chpwdpolicy

Changes parameters of an inactive password policy.

## Enabling PowerSC pro fi le for the HMC

Learn how to enable PowerSC agent on the Hardware Management Console (HMC). You can apply and monitor the PowerSC pro fi le from the HMC. The PowerSC Standard Edition product is delivered with HMC pro fi les along with the basic security hardening features.

## Installing the PowerSC server

## About this task

If you do not have the PowerSC server setup or the latest version of the PowerSC server, install the PowerSC server. For more information, see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/powersc-standard

## Enabling the PowerSC Agent

To enable the PowerSC agent, complete the following steps:

## Procedure

1. Ensure that the incoming of IP addresses is allowed in Firewall Settings for the port 11125. In the HMC, open the fi rewall port 11125 .
2. Get the endpointTrustore.jks fi le from the powersc-uiServer . You can fi nd the fi le in the PowerSC server in the following location:

/etc/security/powersc/uiServer/endpointTrustore.jks

Use the getfile command to deploy it in the correct location in the HMC:

- getfile -t powersctrust -l s -f /etc/security/powersc/uiServer/ endpointTruststore.jks -h &lt;powerSc\_server&gt; -u &lt;user&gt;
3. Start the powersc-uiAgent service with the chhmc command. chhmc -s enable -c powerscuiagent
4. Log in to PowerSC server either from the GUI or ssh to complete the Generate Keystore operation. Click the Keystore Requests tab.
- a) From the UI Endpoint Admin page, click Settings &gt; Endpoint &gt; Keystore &gt; Generate Keystore .
- b) Alternatively, you can use the following command to generate keystore: /opt/powersc/ uiServer/bin/generate\_endpoint\_keystore\_uiServer.sh &lt;endpoint FQDN&gt;
5. Check whether the agent is enabled by running the following command:
- lshmc -r ssh=enable,sshprotocol=2,sshusedns=enable,remotewebui=enable,xntp=disable,xn tpstatus=,xntpserver=,syslogserver=,syslogtcpserver=,syslogtlsserver=,altdis kboot=disable,ldap=disable,kerberos=disable,kerberos\_default\_realm=,kerberos \_realm\_kdc=,kerberos\_clockskew=,kerberos\_ticket\_lifetime=,kpasswd\_admin=,tra ce=,kerberos\_keyfile\_present=,security=legacy,sol=disabled,powerscuiagent=en abled
6. Go to the powersc-uiServer system and select Endpoint admin under the settings icon. The HMC will show up under the Endpoints tab of the Endpoint admin page .

## Solving common problems while securing the HMC

Learn how to solve some problems that you might encounter when you secure the HMC.

## How to secure the connection between the Hardware Management Console (HMC) and the system?

The HMC connects to the system through the Flexible Service Processor (FSP). A proprietary binary protocol called Network Client protocol (NETC) is used for managing both FSP and Power hypervisor. The following table lists ports that are used by the HMC:

Table 26. Ports on FSP that are used to interact with the HMC

|   Port on FSP | Description                          | Protocol version (Default mode)                                     | Protocol Version (NIST mode)   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|           443 | Advanced System Management Interface | HTTPS (TLS 1.2)                                                     | HTTPS (TLS 1.2)                |
|         30000 | NETC                                 | NETC (TLS 1.2). Falls back to SSLv3 for support of older fi rmware. | NETC (TLS 1.2)                 |
|         30001 | VTerm                                | NETC (TLS 1.2). Falls back to SSLv3 for support of older fi rmware. | NETC (TLS 1.2)                 |

## How to lock the HMC?

If you want to enhance the security for your infrastructure, you can use an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) device or add all Hardware Management Consoles and IBM Power systems servers behind a fi rewall. Also, you can disable network services on the HMC if you do not use it remotely or if you want to lock the HMC down. To disable network services on the HMC, complete the following steps:

1. Disable remote command execution by using the SSH port.
2. Disable remote virtual terminal (VTerm).
3. Disable remote web access (HMC graphical user interface and REST API).
4. Block ports in fi rewall by using HMC network settings for each con fi gured Ethernet port.

## How to set the HMC in NIST SP 800-131A compliance mode?

With HMC Version 8.1.0, or later, when you set the HMC in the compliance mode, only strong ciphers listed by NIST SP 800-131A are supported. You might not be able to connect to older Power systems servers such as, POWER5 servers that do not support Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2). For more information about changing the security mode, see HMC V8R8 NIST mode.

## How to view and change ciphers that are used by the HMC?

With HMC Version 8.1.0, or later, the HMC supports more secure cipher sets that are de fi ned in NIST 800-131A. Ciphers that are used in the default mode are strong. For more information about encryption ciphers that are used by the HMC, run the lshmcencr command. If your corporate standards requires the use of a different set of ciphers, run the chhmcencr command to modify the encryption ciphers.

To list the encryption ciphers that are used by the HMC to encrypt user password, run the following command:

```
lshmcencr -c passwd -t c
```

```
To list the encryption ciphers that can currently be used by the HMC web user interface and REST API, run the following command: lshmcencr -c webui -t c To list the encryption ciphers and MAC algorithm that can currently be used by the HMC SSH interface, run the following command:
```

```
lshmcencr -c ssh -t c lshmcencr -c sshmac -t c
```

## How to check the strength of the certi fi cate on the HMC?

The self-signed certi fi cates on the HMC use SHA256 with 2048-bit RSA encryption, which is strong. If you are using CA signed certi fi cates, ensure that you are not using the 1024-bit encryption, which is weak. The following certi fi cates can be used for the HMC:

- The CA signed certi fi cate can be used for the HMC graphical user interface and REST API (port 443).
- The port 9920 is used for HMC to HMC communication. You cannot replace this certi fi cate with your own certi fi cate.

## How to choose between a self-signed certi fi cate (default) or a CA signed certi fi cate?

The HMC auto-generates a certi fi cate during installation. However, you can generate a Certi fi cate Signing Request (CSR) from the HMC and get a new certi fi cate that is issued by a Certi fi cate Authority. You can import this certi fi cate into HMC. Ensure that you also obtain a domain name for the HMC. For more details about managing the certi fi cates in HMC, see Manage Certi fi cates .

## How to audit the HMC?

The audit on the Hardware Management Consoles focuses on con fi gured ciphers and the usage activity of the various HMC users. Use the following commands to view the usage activity of various HMC users:

Table 27. Ciphers that are used by the HMC

| Purpose                                                                | Command                             |

## Managing the HTTPS ciphers of the HMC web interface by using the HMC

You can manage the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) ciphers by using the Hardware Management Console (HMC) for secure communication.

By default, HMC supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) and HTTPS communication with secure cipher sets that are bundled with the HMC. Ciphers that are used in the default mode have strong encryption. These ciphers are used for secure communication on ports 443, 17443, 2301, 5250 proxy, and for internal communication within the HMC. For more information about encryption ciphers that are used by the HMC, you can run the lshmcencr command in the HMC command-line interface (CLI). If the corporate standards of your organization require the use of an alternative set of ciphers, you must run the chhmcencr command to modify the encryption ciphers.

HMC supports both self-signed and CA-signed certi fi cates for encryption. With the HMC Version 10.2.1040.0, or later, you can select the key size of the certi fi cate when you are generating the certi fi cate signing request (CSR). The following values are allowed for the key size of the certi fi cate: 2048, 3072, and 4096. If you are using CA-signed certi fi cates, make sure that you are using a minimum of 2048-bit RSA encryption. By default, HMC uses a self-signed certi fi cate, which has SHA256 algorithm with 2048-bit RSA encryption.

Note: By default, 2048-bit RSA encryption is used if you do not specify any value for the key size of the certi fi cate.

## Generating a certi fi cate for the HMC

This certi fi cate is used for the HMC graphical user interface and REST API through the port 443.

- You can run the following commands to generate a self-signed certi fi cate in the HMC:

```
chhmccert -o apply -t self -i org=IBM,org_unit=HMC,country=US,state=Texas,locality=Austin,days_to_expire=30,email=<email_id> ,key_size=2048 mkhmccert -t self -i "org=TEST,org_unit=HMC,country=<country>,state=<state>,locality=<locality>,email=<email_id>,da
```

## Con fi guring the HMC to retain the HMC in a functional state

Based on a security scan report or due to an organization requirement, you might want to modify the list of the supported ciphers for secure communication. These ciphers are common for legacy and NIST modes. Security scanners might report issues with weak ciphers that are detected. You can work with your security team or the scanner vendor to identify the list of speci fi c ciphers that do not align with their requirements. After the list of weak ciphers is identi fi ed, remove the identi fi ed ciphers from the active cipher list in the HMC.

When you remove weak ciphers from the active ciphers list, some necessary ciphers might also be removed. If the necessary list of ciphers is not present in the HMC, you cannot run any HMC management tasks or commands in the CLI. Also, you cannot initialize the GUI. To retain the HMC in a functional state, you must complete the con fi guration of ciphers.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) ciphers are used in various external and internal communications through different ports. The following ports are used as standard ports for external usage: 443, 2301, and 5250 proxy ports.

- You can run the following command to list all TLS and SSL ciphers that are con fi gurable:

lshmcencr -c &lt;the encryption configuration to list e.g:webui [Web user interface encryption ciphers]&gt; -t &lt;the type of encryptions to list a [ available encryptions] or c [current supported encryption(s)] &gt;

- You can run the following command with an administrator privilege to view the list of available ciphers:

```
lshmcencr -c webui -t a
```

The following example shows a sample output of available cipher sets on the HMC Version 10.1.1022.0:

Note: The list of supported ciphers sets might be a subset of or equal to the list of the available cipher sets. Only the list of the supported cipher sets is con fi gurable. The list of the available cipher sets is not con fi gurable.

## Modifying the ciphers that are used in secure communication

You can modify the ciphers that are used in secure communication. You can remove the ciphers that you are aware of, or you can add a cipher in case you accidentally removed a necessary cipher. To modify any ciphers, complete the following steps:

1. Run the following command to view the list of cipher sets that are supported which can be used in the secure communication:
2. Run the following command to remove the weak ciphers that you are aware of, or that are mentioned in the scan reports, or that your organization policy does not recommend:

```
lshmcencr -c webui -t c
```

chhmcencr -c webui -o r -e &lt;single/multiple comma separated current supported encryption/ ciphers which need to be removed&gt; -r &lt;reboot&gt;

Note: You might also want to remove a cipher in cases where the scan tool does not specify the algorithm but shows a generic message about a weak cipher. The following examples list a few samples of messages from the scan tool:

- TLS/SSL Server Is Using Commonly Used Prime Numbers (tls-dh-primes) TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256 TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384 ---&gt; (Found in HMC) SSL\_DH\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA

In this case, the server is using a common or default prime number as a parameter during the Dif fi e-Hellman key exchange. The use of common prime numbers does not impact all cipher suites that are used by TLS or SSL protocols since not every cipher suite incorporates the Dif fi e-Hellman algorithm.

- TLS/SSL Server Supports the Use of Static Key Ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers) Ports 443 and 2301: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256 TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256

TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA256 TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384

In this case, you must work with your security team or scanner vendor to identify the speci fi c list of ciphers that do not align with their requirements. After the cipher list is identi fi ed, you can run the following command to remove ciphers from the active cipher list in the HMC:

chhmcencr -c webui -o r -e &lt;Single or multiple comma separated Values&gt; -r chhmcencr -c webui -o r -e TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384

3. Run the following command to add a cipher to the active cipher list if you accidentally removed any cipher:

chhmcencr -c webui -o a -e &lt;Single or multiple comma separated Values&gt; -r

Note: If you do not specify the -r option in the command, you will receive a prompt to con fi rm to restart the system. If you specify 1 , the operation completes by modifying the ciphers and restarting the HMC. If you specify 0 , modi fi cations are not initiated.

4. Verify that the following ciphers are present in the active list of ciphers to properly start the HMC:
- TLS\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
- TLS\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
- TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256
- TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA
- TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA
- TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
- TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
- TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA
- TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA
- TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
- TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
5. Restart the HMC to apply changes.

Note: The enterprise baseboard management controller (eBMC) system with fi rmware level FW1050 requires TLS version 1.3 for managing the event noti fi cation mechanisms. Consequently, HMC version 10.3.1050.0 must support TLS version 1.3 ciphers to manage eBMC systems with fi rmware level FW1050.
