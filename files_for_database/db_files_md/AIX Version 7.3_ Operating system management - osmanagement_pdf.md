## About this document

This document provides users and system administrators with complete information that can affect your selection of options when performing such tasks as backing up and restoring the system, managing physical and logical storage, sizing appropriate paging space, and so on. It provides complete information about how to perform such tasks as managing logical volumes, storage, and resources. System users can learn how to perform such tasks as running commands, handling processes, handling fi les and directories, and basic printing.

Other topics useful to users and system administrators include creating and resizing paging space, managing virtual memory, backing up and restoring the system, managing hardware and pseudodevices, using the System Resource Controller (SRC), securing fi les, using storage media, customizing environment fi les, and writing shell scripts. This document is also available on the documentation CD that is shipped with the operating system.

## Highlighting

The following highlighting conventions are used in this document:

Bold

Identi fi es commands, subroutines, keywords, fi les, structures, directories, and other items whose names are prede fi ned by the system. Also identi fi es graphical objects such as buttons, labels, and icons that the user selects.

Italics

Identi fi es parameters whose actual names or values are to be supplied by the user.

Monospace

Identi fi es examples of speci fi c data values, examples of text similar to what you might see displayed, examples of portions of program code similar to what you might write as a programmer, messages from the system, or information you should actually type.

## Case-sensitivity in AIX

Everything in the AIX operating system is case-sensitive, which means that it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, you can use the ls command to list fi les. If you type LS , the system responds that the command is not found . Likewise, FILEA , FiLea , and filea are three distinct fi le names, even if they reside in the same directory. To avoid causing undesirable actions to be performed, always ensure that you use the correct case.

## ISO 9000

ISO 9000 registered quality systems were used in the development and manufacturing of this product.

## Operating system management

System administrators and users can learn how to perform such tasks as running commands, handling processes, handling fi les and directories, backing up and restoring the system, managing physical and logical storage, and basic printing.

Other topics useful to users and system administrators include creating and re-sizing paging space, managing virtual memory, backing up and restoring the system, managing hardware and pseudo devices, using the System Resource Controller (SRC), securing fi les, using storage media, customizing environment fi les, and writing shell scripts. This topic is also available on the documentation CD that is shipped with the operating system.

Operating system management is the task of an individual who is usually referred to, in UNIX literature, as the system administrator. Unfortunately, only a few system administrator activities are straightforward enough to be correctly called administration. This and related guides are intended to help system administrators with their numerous duties.

This operating system provides its own particular version of system-management support in order to promote ease of use and to improve security and integrity.

## Operating system administration

You can use commands to manage system startup and backup, shutting down the system, system shells and environments, system resources, and other different parts of AIX.

Operating system management is the task of an individual who is usually referred to, in UNIX literature, as the system administrator. Unfortunately, only a few system administrator activities are straightforward enough to be correctly called administration. This and related guides are intended to help system administrators with their numerous duties.

This operating system provides its own particular version of system-management support in order to promote ease of use and to improve security and integrity.

## Available system management interfaces

In addition to conventional command line system administration, this operating system provides the SMIT interfaces.

The following are the SMIT interfaces:

- System Management Interface Tool (SMIT), a menu-based user interface that constructs commands from the options you choose and executes them.

With SMIT, you can:

- Install, update, and maintain software
- -Con fi gure devices
- -Con fi gure disk storage units into volume groups and logical volumes
- Make and extend fi le systems and paging space
- Manage users and groups
- -Con fi gure networks and communication applications
- Print
- Perform problem determination
- Schedule jobs
- Manage system resources and workload
- Manage system environments

- Manage cluster system data
- An object-oriented graphical user interface that supports the same system management tasks as SMIT, but eases system management tasks by:
- Reducing user errors through error checking and dialog design
- Offering step-by-step procedures for new or complex tasks
- Offering advanced options for more experienced administrators
- Making it easier to visualize complex data or relationships among system objects
- Monitoring system activity and alerting the administrator when prede fi ned events occur
- Providing context-sensitive helps, overviews, tips, and links to online documentation

## Software vital product data

Certain information about software products and their installable options is maintained in the Software Vital Product Data (SWVPD) database.

The SWVPD consists of a set of commands and Object Data Manager (ODM) object classes for the maintenance of software product information. The SWVPD commands are provided for the user to query ( lslpp ) and verify ( lppchk ) installed software products. The ODM object classes de fi ne the scope and format of the software product information that is maintained.

The installp command uses the ODM to maintain the following information in the SWVPD database:

- Name of the installed software product
- Version of the software product
- Release level of the software product, which indicates changes to the external programming interface of the software product
- Modi fi cation level of the software product, which indicates changes that do not affect the external programming interface of the software product
- Fix level of the software product, which indicates small updates that are to be built into a regular modi fi cation level at a later time
- Fix identi fi cation fi eld
- Names, checksums, and sizes of the fi les that make up the software product or option
- Installation state of the software product: applying, applied, committing, committed, rejecting, or broken.

## Operating system updates

The operating system package is divided into fi lesets, where each fi leset contains a group of logically related customer deliverable fi les. Each fi leset can be individually installed and updated.

Revisions to fi lesets are tracked using the version, release, maintenance, and fi x (VRMF) levels. By convention, each time an AIX fi leset update is applied, the fi x level is adjusted. Each time an AIX maintenance package or technology level is applied, the modi fi cation level is adjusted, and the fi x level is reset to zero. The initial installation of an AIX version, for example, AIX Â® 6.1, is called a base installation. The operating system provides updates to its features and functionality, which might be packaged as a maintenance package, a technology level, a program temporary fi x (PTF), or a service pack (a group of PTFs).

## Maintenance Packages and Technology Levels

Maintenance packages and technology levels provide new functionality that is intended to upgrade the release. The maintenance part of the VRMF is updated in a maintenance package. For example, the fi rst maintenance package for AIX 6.1 is 6.1.1.0; the second is 6.1.2.0, and so on. To list the maintenance package, use the oslevel -r command.

To determine the maintenance package or technology level installed on a particular system, type:

oslevel

To determine which fi lesets need an update for the system to reach a speci fi c maintenance package or technology level (in this example, 6.1.1.0), use the following command:

```
oslevel -l 6.1.1.0
```

To determine if a recommended maintenance package or technology level is installed (in this example, 6100-02), use the following command:

```
oslevel -r 6100-02
```

To determine which fi lesets need an update for the system to reach the 6100-02 maintenance package or technology level, use the following command:

```
oslevel -rl 6100-02
```

To determine the maintenance package or technology level of a particular fi leset (in this example, bos.mp ), use the following command:

```
lslpp -L bos.mp
```

## PTFs

Between releases, you might receive PTFs to correct or prevent a particular problem. A particular installation might need some, all, or even none of the available PTFs.

## Recommended Maintenance Packages

A recommended maintenance package is a set of PTFs between technology levels that have been extensively tested together and are recommended for preventive maintenance.

## Interim Fixes

An interim fi x is similar to a PTF, but it is usually offered when a PTF is not available. Interim fi xes are also released when the PTF would upgrade a system to the next maintenance level and users might want their systems to remain at the current level.

To determine the version and release level, maintenance package, technology level, and service pack level, as well as which fi lesets need to be updated to reach a particular level, see the oslevel and the lslpp commands .

## System startup

When the base operating system starts, the system initiates a complex set of tasks. Under normal conditions, these tasks are performed automatically.

There are some situations when you want to instruct the system to reboot; for example, to cause the system to recognize newly installed software, to reset peripheral devices, to perform routine maintenance tasks like checking fi le systems, or to recover from a system hang or crash. For information on these procedures, see:

## Related tasks

Recreating a corrupted boot image

The following procedure describes how to identify a corrupted boot image and re-create it.

## Administering system startup

There are multiple scenarios that you might encounter when you want to boot or reboot your system. To shut down or reboot your system you can use either the shutdown or reboot command. You should use the shutdown command when multiple users are logged on to the system.

## Rebooting a running system

Because processes might be running that should be terminated more gracefully than a reboot permits, shutdown is the preferred method for all systems.

There are two methods for shutting down and rebooting your system, shutdown and reboot . Always use the shutdown method when multiple users are logged on to the system.

| Task                           | SMIT Fast Path   | Command or File       |
|--------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Rebooting a Multiuser System   | smit shutdown    | shutdown -r           |
| Rebooting a Single-User System | smit shutdown    | shutdown -r or reboot |

## Rebooting a unresponsive system remotely

The remote reboot facility allows the system to be rebooted through a native (integrated) system port.

The POWER5 integrated system ports are similar to serial ports except that system ports are available only for speci fi cally supported functions.

The system is rebooted when the reboot\_string is received at the port. This facility is useful when the system does not otherwise respond but is capable of servicing system port interrupts. Remote reboot can be enabled on only one native system port at a time. Users are expected to provide their own external security for the port. This facility runs at the highest device interrupt class and a failure of the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receive/Transmit) to clear the transmit buffer quickly may have the effect of causing other devices to lose data if their buffers overflow during this time. It is suggested that this facility only be used to reboot a machine that is otherwise hung and cannot be remotely logged into. File systems will not be synchronized, and a potential for some loss of data which has not been flushed exists. It is strongly suggested that when remote reboot is enabled that the port not be used for any other purpose, especially fi le transfer, to prevent an inadvertent reboot.

Two native system port attributes control the operation of remote reboot.

## reboot\_enable

Indicates whether this port is enabled to reboot the machine on receipt of the remote reboot\_string , and if so, whether to take a system dump prior to rebooting.

```
reboot -Indicates remote reboot is enabled dump -Indicates remote reboot is enabled, and prior to rebooting a system dump
```

```
no -Indicates remote reboot is disabled will be taken on the primary dump device
```

## reboot\_string

Speci fi es the remote reboot\_string that the serial port will scan for when the remote reboot feature is enabled. When the remote reboot feature is enabled and the reboot\_string is received on the port, a &gt; character is transmitted and the system is ready to reboot. If a 1 character is received, the system is rebooted; any character other than 1 aborts the reboot process. The reboot\_string has a maximum length of 16 characters and must not contain a space, colon, equal sign, null, new line, or Ctrl-\ character.

Remote reboot can be enabled through SMIT or the command line. For SMIT the path System Environments -&gt; Manage Remote Reboot Facility may be used for a con fi gured TTY. Alternatively, when con fi guring a new TTY, remote reboot may be enabled from the Add a TTY or Change/Show Characteristics of a TTY menus. These menus are accessed through the path Devices -&gt; TTY .

From the command line, the mkdev or chdev commands are used to enable remote reboot. For example, the following command enables remote reboot (with the dump option) and sets the reboot string to ReBoOtMe on tty1 .

```
chdev -l tty1 -a remreboot=dump -a reboot_string=ReBoOtMe
```

```
This example enables remote reboot on tty0 with the current reboot_string in the database only (will take effect on the next reboot). chdev -P -l tty0 -a remreboot=reboot
```

If the tty is being used as a normal port, then you will have to use the pdisable command before enabling remote reboot. You may use penable to reenable the port afterwards.

## Booting from hard disk for maintenance

You can boot a machine in maintenance mode from a hard disk.

## Prerequisites

A bootable removable media (tape or CD-ROM) must not be in the drive. Also, refer to the hardware documentation for the speci fi c instructions to enable maintenance mode boot on your particular model.

## Procedure

To boot a machine in maintenance mode from a hard disk:

1. To reboot, either turn the machine off and then power it back on, or press the reset button.
2. Press the key sequence for rebooting in maintenance mode that is speci fi ed in your hardware documentation.
3. The machine will boot to a point where it has a console device con fi gured.
4. If there is a system dump that needs to be retrieved, the system dump menu will be displayed on the console.

## Note:

- a. If the console fails to con fi gure when there is a dump to be retrieved, the system will hang. The system must be booted from a removable medium to retrieve the dump.
- b. The system automatically dumps to the speci fi ed dump device when the reset button is pressed. To change the primary or secondary dump device designation in a running system, see the sysdumpdev command.
4. If there is no system dump, or if it has been copied, the diagnostic operating instructions will be displayed. Press Enter to continue to the Function Selection menu.
5. From the Function Selection menu, you can select diagnostic or single-user mode:

Single-User Mode: To perform maintenance in a single-user environment, choose this option (option 5). The system continues to boot and enters single-user mode. Maintenance that requires the system to be in a standalone mode can be performed in this mode, and the bosboot command can be run, if required.

## Booting a system that has crashed

In some instances, you might have to boot a system that has stopped (crashed) without being properly shut down.

The prerequisites for this procedure are:

- Your system crashed and was not properly shut down due to unusual conditions.

- Your system is turned off.

This procedure covers the basics of how to boot if your system was unable to recover from a crash. Perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that all hardware and peripheral devices are correctly connected.
2. Turn on all of the peripheral devices.
3. Watch the screen for information about automatic hardware diagnostics.
- a) If any hardware diagnostics tests are unsuccessful, refer to the hardware documentation.
- b) If all hardware diagnostics tests are successful, turn the system unit on.

## Resetting an unknown root password

The following procedure describes how to recover access to root privileges when the system's root password is unavailable or unknown.

The following procedure requires some system downtime. If possible, schedule your downtime when it least impacts your workload to protect yourself from a possible loss of data or functionality.

The information in this how-to scenario was tested using speci fi c versions of AIX. The results you obtain might vary signi fi cantly depending on your version and level of AIX.

1. Insert the product media for the same version and level as the current installation into the appropriate drive.
2. Power on the machine.
3. When the screen of icons appears, or when you hear a double beep, press the F1 key repeatedly until the System Management Services menu appears.
4. Select Multiboot .
5. Select Install From .
6. Select the device that holds the product media and then select Install .
7. Select the AIX version icon.
8. De fi ne your current system as the system console by pressing the F1 key and then press Enter.
9. Select the number of your preferred language and press Enter.
10. Choose Start Maintenance Mode for System Recovery by typing 3 and press Enter.
11. Select Access a Root Volume Group .
12. A message displays explaining that you will not be able to return to the Installation menus without rebooting if you change the root volume group at this point.
12. Type 0 and press Enter.
13. Type the number of the appropriate volume group from the list and press Enter.
14. Select Access this Volume Group and start a shell by typing 1 and press Enter.
15. At the # (number sign) prompt, type the passwd command at the command line prompt to reset the root password.
17. For example:

```
# passwd Changing password for "root" root's New password: Enter the new password again:
```

```
16. To write everything from the buffer to the hard disk and reboot the system, type the following: sync;sync;sync;reboot
```

When the login screen appears, the password you set in step 15 should now permit access to root privileges.

## Booting systems with planar graphics

If the machine has been installed with the planar graphics susbsystem only, and later an additional graphics adapter is added to the system, the following occurs:

1. A new graphics adapter is added to the system, and its associated device driver software is installed.
2. The system is rebooted, and one of the following occurs:
- a. If the system console is de fi ned to be /dev/lft0 ( lscons displays this information), the user is asked to select which display is the system console at reboot time. If the user selects a graphics adapter (non-TTY device), it also becomes the new default display. If the user selects a TTY device instead of an LFT device, no system login appears. Reboot again, and the TTY login screen is displayed. It is assumed that if the user adds an additional graphics adapter into the system and the system console is an LFT device, the user will not select the TTY device as the system console.
- b. If the system console is de fi ned to be a TTY, then at reboot time the newly added display adapter becomes the default display.
5. Note: Since the TTY is the system console, it remains the system console.
3. If the system console is /def/lft0 , then after reboot, DPMS is disabled in order to show the system console selection text on the screen for an inde fi nite period of time. To re-enable DPMS, reboot the system again.

## Deploying run level script execution

Run level scripts allow users to start and stop selected applications while changing the run level.

Put run level scripts in the subdirectory of /etc/rc.d that is speci fi c to the run level:

- /etc/rc.d/rc2.d
- /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
- /etc/rc.d/rc4.d
- /etc/rc.d/rc5.d
- /etc/rc.d/rc6.d
- /etc/rc.d/rc7.d
- /etc/rc.d/rc8.d
- /etc/rc.d/rc9.d

The /etc/rc.d/rc will run the scripts it fi nds in the speci fi ed directory when the run level changes fi rst running the stop application scripts then running the start application scripts.

Note: Scripts beginning with K are stop scripts, while scripts beginning with S are start scripts.

## Modifying the /etc/inittab fi le

Four commands are available to modify the records in the etc/inittab fi le.

## Adding records mkitab command

To add a record to the /etc/inittab fi le, type the following at a command prompt:

```
mkitab Identifier:Run Level:Action:Command For example, to add a record for tty2, type the following at a command prompt: mkitab tty002:2:respawn:/usr/sbin/getty /dev/tty2
```

In the above example:

## Item

tty002

## Description

Identi fi es the object whose run level you are de fi ning.

## Item

2

respawn

/usr/sbin/getty /dev/tty2

## Description

Speci fi es the run level at which this process runs.

Speci fi es the action that the init command should take for this process.

Speci fi es the shell command to be executed.

## Changing records chitab command

To change a record to the /etc/inittab fi le, type the following at a command prompt:

```
chitab Identifier:Run Level:Action:Command
```

For example, to change a record for tty2 so that this process runs at run levels 2 and 3, type:

```
chitab tty002:23:respawn:/usr/sbin/getty /dev/tty2
```

In the above example:

## Item

## Description

tty002

Identi fi es the object whose run level you are de fi ning.

23

Speci fi es the run levels at which this process runs.

respawn

Speci fi es the action that the init command should take for this process.

/usr/sbin/getty /dev/tty2

Speci fi es the shell command to be executed.

## Listing records lsitab command

To list all records in the /etc/inittab fi le, type the following at a command prompt:

lsitab -a

To list a speci fi c record in the /etc/inittab fi le, type:

lsitab Identifier

For example, to list the record for tty2, type: lsitab tty2 .

## Removing records rmitab command

To remove a record from the /etc/inittab fi le, type the following at a command prompt:

rmitab Identifier

For example, to remove the record for tty2, type: rmitab tty2 .

## Related concepts

System run level

The system run level speci fi es the system state and de fi nes which processes are started.

## Reactivation of an inactive system

Your system can become inactive because of a hardware problem, a software problem, or a combination of both.

This procedure guides you through steps to correct the problem and restart your system. If your system is still inactive after completing the procedure, refer to the problem-determination information in your hardware documentation.

Use the following procedures to reactivate an inactive system:

## Hardware check

There are several procedures you can use to check your hardware.

Check your hardware by:

## Checking the power:

If the Power-On light on your system is active, go to Checking the operator panel display , below.

If the Power-On light on your system is not active, check that the power is on and the system is plugged in.

## Checking the operator panel display:

If your system has an operator panel display, check it for any messages.

If the operator panel display on your system is blank, go to Activating your display or terminal , below.

If the operator panel display on your system is not blank, go to the service guide for your unit to fi nd information concerning digits in the Operator Panel Display.

## Activating your display or terminal:

Check several parts of your display or terminal, as follows:

- Make sure the display cable is securely attached to the display and to the system unit.
- Make sure the keyboard cable is securely attached.
- Make sure the mouse cable is securely attached.
- Make sure the display is turned on and that its Power-On light is lit.
- Adjust the brightness control on the display.
- Make sure the terminal's communication settings are correct.

If your system is now active, your hardware checks have corrected the problem.

## Related tasks

## Restarting the system

In addition to checking the hardware and checking the processes, you can restart you system to reactivate an inactive system.

## Checking the processes

A stopped or stalled process might make your system inactive.

Checking the processes

A stopped or stalled process might make your system inactive.

Check your system processes by:

1. Restarting line scrolling
2. Using the Ctrl+D key sequence
3. Using the Ctrl+C key sequence
4. Logging in from a remote terminal or host
5. Ending stalled processes remotely

## Restarting line scrolling:

Restart line scrolling halted by the Ctrl-S key sequence by doing the following:

1. Activate the window or shell with the problem process.
2. Press the Ctrl-Q key sequence to restart scrolling.

The Ctrl-S key sequence stops line scrolling, and the Ctrl-Q key sequence restarts line scrolling.

If your scroll check did not correct the problem with your inactive system, go to the next section, Using the Ctrl-D key sequence .

Using the Ctrl-D key sequence:

1. Activate the window or shell with the problem process.
2. Press the Ctrl-D key sequence. The Ctrl-D key sequence sends an end of fi le (EOF) signal to the process. The Ctrl-D key sequence may close the window or shell and log you out.

If the Ctrl-D key sequence did not correct the problem with your inactive system, go to the next section, Using the Ctrl-C key sequence .

## Using the Ctrl-C key sequence:

End a stopped process by doing the following:

1. Activate the window or shell with the problem process.
2. Press the Ctrl-C key sequence. The Ctrl-C key sequence stops the current search or fi lter.

If the Ctrl-C key sequence did not correct the problem with your inactive system, go to the next section, Logging in from a remote terminal or host: .

## Logging in from a remote terminal or host:

Log in remotely in either of two ways:

- Log in to the system from another terminal if more than one terminal is attached to your system.
- Log in from another host on the network (if your system is connected to a network) by typing the tn command as follows:

```
tn YourSystemName
```

The system asks for your regular login name and password when you use the tn command.

If you were able to log in to the system from a remote terminal or host, go to the next section, Ending stalled processes remotely .

If you were not able to log in to the system from a remote terminal or host you need to restart the system.

You can also start a system dump to determine why your system became inactive.

## Ending stalled processes remotely:

End a stalled process from a remote terminal by doing the following:

1. List active processes by typing the following ps command:

```
ps -ef
```

The -e and -f flags identify all active and inactive processes.

2. Identify the process ID of the stalled process.

For help in identifying processes, use the grep command with a search string. For example, to end the xlock process, type the following to fi nd the process ID:

```
ps -ef | grep xlock
```

The grep command allows you to search on the output from the ps command to identify the process ID of a speci fi c process.

3. End the process by typing the following kill command:

Note: You must have root user authority to use the kill command on processes you did not initiate.

```
kill -9 ProcessID
```

If you cannot identify the problem process, the most recently activated process might be the cause of your inactive system. End the most recent process if you think that is the problem.

If your process checks have not corrected the problem with your inactive system you need to restart the system.

## Restarting the system

In addition to checking the hardware and checking the processes, you can restart you system to reactivate an inactive system.

If the procedures for 'Hardware check' on page 9 and 'Checking the processes' on page 9 fail to correct the problem that makes your system inactive, you need to restart your system.

Note: Before restarting your system, complete a system dump.

1. Check the state of the boot device.

Your system boots with either a removable medium, an external device, a small computer system interface (SCSI) device, an integrated device electronics (IDE) device, or a local area network (LAN). Decide which method applies to your system, and use the following instructions to check the boot device:

- For a removable medium, such as tape, make sure the medium is inserted correctly.
- For IDE devices, verify that the IDE device ID settings are unique per adapter. If only one device is attached to the adapter, the IDE device ID must be set to the master device.
- For an externally attached device, such as a tape drive, make sure:
- The power to the device is turned on.
- The device cables are correctly attached to the device and to the system unit.
- The ready indicator is on (if the device has one).
- For external SCSI devices, verify that the SCSI address settings are unique.
- For a LAN, verify that the network is up and operable.

If the boot device is working correctly, continue to the next step.

2. Load your operating system by doing the following:
- a) Turn off your system's power.
- b) Wait one minute.
- c) Turn on your system's power.
- d) Wait for the system to boot.

If the operating system failed to load, boot the hard disk from maintenance mode or hardware diagnostics.

If you are still unable to restart the system, use an SRN to report the problem with your inactive system to your service representative.

## Creating boot images

To install the base operating system or to access a system that will not boot from the system hard drive, you need a boot image. This procedure describes how to create boot images. The boot image varies for each type of device.

When the system is fi rst installed, the bosboot command creates a boot image from a RAM (random access memory) disk fi le system image and the operating system kernel. The boot image is transferred to a particular media such as the hard disk. When the machine is rebooted, the boot image is loaded from the media into memory. For more information about the bosboot command, see bosboot .

The associated RAM disk fi le system contains device con fi guration routines for the following devices:

- Disk
- Tape
- CD-ROM
- Network Token-Ring, Ethernet, or FDDI device
- You must have root user authority to use the bosboot command.
- The /tmp fi le system must have at least 20 MB of free space.
- The physical disk must contain the boot logical volume. To determine which disk device to specify, type the following at a command prompt:

```
lsvg -l rootvg
```

The lsvg -l command lists the logical volumes on the root volume group (rootvg). From this list you can fi nd the name of the boot logical volume.

Then type the following at a command prompt:

```
lsvg -M rootvg
```

The lsvg -M command lists the physical disks that contain the various logical volumes.

## Creating a boot image on a boot logical volume

If the base operating system is being installed (either a new installation or an update), the bosboot command is called to place the boot image on the boot logical volume. The boot logical volume is a physically contiguous area on the disk created through the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) during installation.

For a list of prerequisites for this procedure, see 'Creating boot images' on page 12.

The bosboot command does the following:

1. Checks the fi le system to see if there is enough room to create the boot image.
2. Creates a RAM fi le system using the mkfs command and a prototype fi le.
3. Calls the mkboot command, which merges the kernel and the RAM fi le system into a boot image.
4. Writes the boot image to the boot logical volume.

To create a boot image on the default boot logical volume on the fi xed disk, type the following at a command prompt:

```
bosboot -a OR: bosboot -ad /dev/ipldevice
```

Note: Do not reboot the machine if the bosboot command fails while creating a boot image. Resolve the problem and run the bosboot command to successful completion.

You must reboot the system for the new boot image to be available for use.

## Creating boot images for network devices

You can create boot images for an Ethernet boot or Token-Ring boot.

For a list of prerequisites for this procedure, see 'Creating boot images' on page 12.

To create a boot image for an Ethernet boot, type the following at a command prompt:

| bosboot -ad /dev/ent   |
|------------------------|
| For a Token-Ring boot: |
| bosboot -ad /dev/tok   |

## System run level

The system run level speci fi es the system state and de fi nes which processes are started.

For example, when the system run level is 3, all processes de fi ned to operate at that run level are started. Near the end of the system boot phase of the boot process, the run level is read from the initdefault entry of the /etc/inittab fi le. The system operates at that run level until it receives a signal to change it. The system run level can be changed with the init command. The /etc/inittab fi le contains a record for each process that de fi nes run levels for that process. When the system boots, the init command reads the /etc/inittab fi le to determine which processes to start.

The following are the currently-de fi ned run levels:

| Item    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-9     | When the init command changes to run levels 0-9, it kills all processes at the current run levels then restarts any processes associated with the new run levels.                           |
| 0-1     | Reserved for the future use of the operating system.                                                                                                                                        |
| 2       | Default run level.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3-9     | Can be de fi ned according to the user's preferences.                                                                                                                                       |
| a, b, c | When the init command requests a change to run levels a , b , or c , it does not kill processes at the current run levels; it simply starts any processes assigned with the new run levels. |

- Q, q Tells the init command to reexamine the /etc/inittab fi le.

## Related tasks

Modifying the /etc/inittab fi le

Four commands are available to modify the records in the etc/inittab fi le.

## Identifying the system run level

Before performing maintenance on the operating system or changing the system run level, you might need to examine the various run levels.

This procedure describes how to identify the run level at which the system is operating and how to display a history of previous run levels. The init command determines the system run level.

## Identi fi cation of the current run level

At the command line, type cat /etc/.init.state . The system displays one digit; that is the current run level. See the init command or the /etc/inittab fi le for more information about run levels.

Displaying a history of previous run levels You can display a history of previous run levels using the fwtmp command.

Note: The bosext2.acct.obj code must be installed on your system to use this command.

1. Log in as root user.
2. Type the following at a command prompt:

```
/usr/lib/acct/fwtmp </var/adm/wtmp |grep run-level The system displays information similar to the following:
```

```
run-level 2 0 1 0062 0123 697081013 Sun Feb 2 19:36:53 CST 1992 run-level 2 0 1 0062 0123 697092441 Sun Feb 2 22:47:21 CST 1992 run-level 4 0 1 0062 0123 698180044 Sat Feb 15 12:54:04 CST 1992 run-level 2 0 1 0062 0123 698959131 Sun Feb 16 10:52:11 CST 1992 run-level 5 0 1 0062 0123 698967773 Mon Feb 24 15:42:53 CST 1992
```

## Con fi guring run levels on multiuser systems

You can change run levels on multiuser systems.

1. Check the /etc/inittab fi le to con fi rm that the run level to which you are changing supports the processes that you are running.
2. The getty process is particularly important, since it controls the terminal line access for the system console and other logins. Ensure that the getty process is enabled at all run levels.
2. Use the wall command to inform all users that you intend to change the run level and request that users log off.
4. For more information about the wall command, see wall .
3. Use the smit telinit fast path to access the Set System Run Level menu.
4. Type the new run level in the System RUN LEVEL fi eld.
5. Press Enter to implement all of the settings in this procedure.

The system responds by telling you which processes are terminating or starting as a result of the change in run level and by displaying the message:

```
INIT: New run level: n
```

where n is the new run-level number.

## Con fi guring run levels on single-user systems

You can change run levels on single-user systems.

1. Check the /etc/inittab fi le to con fi rm that the run level to which you are changing supports the processes that you are running.

The getty process is particularly important, since it controls the terminal line access for the system console and other logins. Ensure that the getty process is enabled at all run levels. For more information about the inittab fi le, see inittab .

2. Use the smit telinit fast path to access the Set System Run Level menu.

For more information about the telinit command, see telinit .

3. Type the new system run level in the System RUN LEVEL fi eld.
4. Press Enter to implement all of the settings in this procedure.

The system responds by telling you which processes are terminating or starting as a result of the change in run level and by displaying the message:

```
INIT: New run level: n
```

where n is the new run-level number.

## Boot process

There are three types of system boots and two resources that are required in order to boot the operating system.

During the boot process, the system tests the hardware, loads and runs the operating system, and con fi gures devices. To boot the operating system, the following resources are required:

- A boot image that can be loaded after the machine is turned on or reset.
- Access to the root ( / ) and /usr fi le systems.

There are three types of system boots:

## Item

## Description

Hard Disk Boot

A machine is started for normal operations.

Diskless Network Boot

A diskless or dataless workstation is started remotely over a network. A machine is started for normal operations. One or more remote fi le servers provide the fi les and programs that diskless or dataless workstations need to boot.

## Maintenance Boot

A machine is started from a hard disk, network, tape, or CD-ROM in maintenance mode. A system administrator can perform tasks such as installing new or updated software and running diagnostic checks.

During a hard disk boot, the boot image is found on a local disk created when the operating system was installed. During the boot process, the system con fi gures all devices found in the machine and initializes other basic software required for the system to operate (such as the Logical Volume Manager). At the end of this process, the fi le systems are mounted and ready for use.

The same general requirements apply to diskless network clients. They also require a boot image and access to the operating system fi le tree. Diskless network clients have no local fi le systems and get all their information by way of remote access.

## Related concepts

## Processing the system boot

Most users perform a hard disk boot when starting the system for general operations. The system fi nds all information necessary to the boot process on its disk drive.

## Maintenance boot process

Occasions might arise when a boot is needed to perform special tasks such as installing new or updated software, performing diagnostic checks, or for maintenance. In this case, the system starts from a bootable medium such as a CD-ROM, DVD, tape drive, network, or disk drive.

## RAM fi le system

The RAM fi le system, part of the boot image, is totally memory-resident and contains all programs that allow the boot process to continue. The fi les in the RAM fi le system are speci fi c to the type of boot.

## Processing the system boot

Most users perform a hard disk boot when starting the system for general operations. The system fi nds all information necessary to the boot process on its disk drive.

When the system is started by turning on the power switch (a cold boot) or restarted with the reboot or shutdown commands (a warm boot), a number of events must occur before the system is ready for use. These events can be divided into the following phases:

## Related concepts

Boot process

There are three types of system boots and two resources that are required in order to boot the operating system.

## Firmware phase

The fi rmware prepares the system to load and run the operating system.

Its initialization phase involves the following steps:

1. The fi rmware performs basic testing on the system resources that are required for starting the operating system.
2. The fi rmware checks the user boot list, a list of available boot devices. This boot list can be changed to suit your requirements by using the bootlist command. If the user boot list in non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) is not valid or if a valid boot device is not found, the default boot list is then checked. In either case, the fi rst valid boot device found in the boot list is used for system startup. If a valid user boot list exists in NVRAM, the devices in the list are checked in order. If no user boot list exists, all adapters and devices on the bus are checked. In either case, devices are checked in a continuous loop until a valid boot device is found for system startup.
3. Note: The system maintains a default boot list that is stored in NVRAM for normal mode boot. A separate service mode boot list is also stored in NVRAM, and you must refer to the speci fi c hardware instructions for your model to learn how to access the service-mode boot list.
3. When a valid boot device is found, the fi rst record or program sector number (PSN) is checked. If it is a valid boot record, it is read into memory and is added to the IPL control block in memory. Included in the key boot record data are the starting location of the boot image on the boot device, the length of the boot image, and instructions on where to load the boot image in memory.
4. The boot image is read sequentially from the boot device into memory starting at the location speci fi ed in NVRAM. The disk boot image consists of the kernel, a RAM fi le system, and base customized device information.
5. Control is passed to the kernel, which begins system initialization.
6. The kernel runs init , which runs phase 1 of the rc.boot script.

When the kernel initialization phase is completed, base device con fi guration begins.

## Base device con fi guration phase

The init process starts the rc.boot script. Phase 1 of the rc.boot script performs the base device con fi guration.

Phase 1 of the rc.boot script includes the following steps:

1. The boot script calls the restbase program to build the customized Object Data Manager (ODM) database in the RAM fi le system from the compressed customized data.
2. The boot script starts the con fi guration manager, which accesses phase 1 ODM con fi guration rules to con fi gure the base devices.
3. The con fi guration manager starts the sys , bus , disk , SCSI, and the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and rootvg volume group con fi guration methods.
4. The con fi guration methods load the device drivers, create special fi les, and update the customized data in the ODM database.

## Booting the system

This procedure completes the system boot phase.

1. The init process starts phase 2 running of the rc.boot script. Phase 2 of rc.boot includes the following steps:
- a) Call the ipl\_varyon program to vary on the rootvg volume group.
- b) Mount the hard disk fi le systems onto their normal mount points.
- c) Run the swapon program to start paging.

- d) Copy the customized data from the ODM database in the RAM fi le system to the ODM database in the hard disk fi le system.
- e) Exit the rc.boot script.
2. After phase 2 of the rc.boot script is complete, the boot process switches from the RAM fi le system to the fi le systems that are stored on the hard disk.
3. Then the init process runs the processes de fi ned by records in the /etc/inittab fi le. One of the instructions in the /etc/inittab fi le runs phase 3 of the rc.boot script, which includes the following steps:
- a) Mount the /tmp hard disk fi le system.
- b) Start the con fi guration manager phase 2 to con fi gure all remaining devices.
- c) Use the savebase command to save the customized data to the boot logical volume.
- d) Exit the rc.boot script.

At the end of this process, the system is up and ready for use.

## Maintenance boot process

Occasions might arise when a boot is needed to perform special tasks such as installing new or updated software, performing diagnostic checks, or for maintenance. In this case, the system starts from a bootable medium such as a CD-ROM, DVD, tape drive, network, or disk drive.

The maintenance boot sequence of events is similar to the sequence of a normal boot.

1. The fi rmware performs basic testing on the system resources that are required for starting the operating system.
2. The fi rmware checks the user boot list. You can use the bootlist command to change the user boot list to suit your requirements. If the user boot list in non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) is not valid or if no valid boot device is found, the default boot list is checked. In either case, the fi rst valid boot device found in the boot list is used for starting the system.
3. Note: For a normal boot, the operating system also maintains a default boot list and a user boot list, which are stored in NVRAM. Separate default boot list and user boot list are also maintained for starting the system in maintenance mode.
3. When a valid boot device is found, the fi rst record or program sector number (PSN) is checked. If it is a valid boot record, it is read into memory and is added to the initial program load (IPL) control block in memory. Included in the key boot record data are the starting location of the boot image on the boot device, the length of the boot image, and the offset to the entry point to start running when the boot image is in memory.
4. The boot image is read sequentially from the boot device into memory, starting at the location speci fi ed in NVRAM.
5. Control is passed to the kernel, which begins running programs in the RAM fi le system.
6. The ODM database contents determine which devices are present, and the cfgmgr command dynamically con fi gures all devices found, including all disks which are to contain the root fi le system.
7. If a CD-ROM, DVD, tape, or the network is used to boot the system, the rootvg volume group (or rootvg) is not varied on, because the rootvg might not exist (as is the case when installing the operating system on a new system). Network con fi guration can occur at this time. No paging occurs when a maintenance boot is performed.

At the end of this process, the system is ready for installation, maintenance, or diagnostics.

Note: If the system is started from the hard disk, the rootvg is varied on, the hard disk root fi le system and the hard disk /usr fi le system are mounted in the RAM fi le system, a menu is displayed that allows you to enter various diagnostics modes or single-user mode. If you select single-user mode, you can continue the boot process and enter single-user mode, where the init run level is set to the letter S. The system is then ready for maintenance, software updates, or for running the bosboot command.

## Related concepts

Boot process

There are three types of system boots and two resources that are required in order to boot the operating system.

## RAM fi le system

The RAM fi le system, part of the boot image, is totally memory-resident and contains all programs that allow the boot process to continue. The fi les in the RAM fi le system are speci fi c to the type of boot.

A maintenance boot RAM fi le system might not have the logical volume routines, because the rootvg might not need to be varied on. During a hard disk boot, however, it is desirable that the rootvg be varied on and paging activated as soon as possible. Although there are differences in these two boot scenarios, the structure of the RAM fi le system does not vary to a great extent.

The init command, which is located on the RAM fi le system, is a basic boot command interpreter program that is designed for use during the boot process. This boot command interpreter program controls the boot process by calling the rc.boot script. The rc.boot script determines from which device the machine was started. The boot device determines which devices must be con fi gured on the RAM fi le system. If the machine is started over the network, the network devices need to be con fi gured so that the client fi le systems can be remotely mounted. In the case of a tape, CD-ROM, or DVD boot, the console is con fi gured to display the base operating system (BOS) installation menus. After the rc.boot script identi fi es the boot device, the appropriate con fi guration routines are called from the RAM fi le system. The rc.boot script is called twice by the boot command interpreter program to match the two con fi guration phases during the boot process. A third call to rc.boot occurs during a disk or a network boot when the real init command is called. The inittab fi le contains an rc.boot stanza that completes the fi nal con fi guration of the machine.

The RAM fi le system for each boot device is also unique because of the various types of devices to be con fi gured. A prototype fi le is associated with each type of boot device. The prototype fi le is a template of fi les making up the RAM fi le system. The bosboot command uses the mkfs command to create the RAM fi le system using the various prototype fi les. See the bosboot command for more details.

## System backup

Once your system is in use, your next consideration should be to back up the fi le systems, directories, and fi les. If you back up your fi le systems, you can restore fi les or fi le systems in the event of a hard disk crash. There are different methods for backing up information.

Backing up fi le systems, directories, and fi les represents a signi fi cant investment of time and effort. At the same time, all computer fi les are potentially easy to change or erase, either intentionally or by accident.

<!-- image -->

Attention: When a hard disk crashes, the information contained on that disk is destroyed. The only way to recover the destroyed data is to retrieve the information from your backup copy.

If you use a careful and methodical approach to backing up your fi le systems, you should always be able to restore recent versions of fi les or fi le systems with little dif fi culty.

Several methods exist for backing up information. One of the most frequently used methods is called backup by name , fi le name archive , or regular backup . This is a copy of a fi le system, directory, or fi le that is kept for fi le transfer or in case the original data is unintentionally changed or destroyed. This method of backup is done when the i flag is speci fi ed and is used to make a backup copy of individual fi les and directories. It is a method commonly used by individual users to back up their accounts.

Another frequently used method is called backup by i-node , fi le system archive , or archive backup . This method of backup is done when the i flag is not speci fi ed. This is used for future reference, historical purposes, or for recovery if the original data is damaged or lost. It is used to make a backup copy of an entire fi le system and is the method commonly used by system administrators to back up large groups of fi les, such as all of the user accounts in /home . A fi le system backup allows incremental backups to be performed easily. An incremental backup backs up all fi les that have been modi fi ed since a speci fi ed previous backup.

The compress and pack commands enable you to compress fi les for storage, and the uncompress and unpack commands unpack the fi les once they have been restored. The process of packing and unpacking fi les takes time, but once packed, the data uses less space on the backup medium. For more information about these commands, see compress , pack , uncompress , and unpack .

Several commands create backups and archives. Because of this, data that has been backed up needs to be labeled as to which command was used to initiate the backup, and how the backup was made (by name or by fi le system).

Backing up user fi les or fi le systems

Two procedures can be used to back up fi les and fi le systems: the SMIT fast paths smit backfile or smit backfilesys , and the backup command.

## Backup concepts

Before you start backing up your data, you need to understand the types of data, policies, and media that you can use.

## Backup policies

No single backup policy can meet the needs of all users. A policy that works well for a system with one user, for example, could be inadequate for a system that serves one hundred users. Likewise, a policy developed for a system on which many fi les are changed daily would be inef fi cient for a system on which data changes infrequently.

Whatever the appropriate backup strategy for your site, it is very important that one exist and that backups be done frequently and regularly. It is dif fi cult to recover from data loss if a good backup strategy has not been implemented.

Only you can determine the best backup policy for your system, but the following general guidelines might be helpful:

## Â· Make sure you can recover from major losses.

Can your system continue to run after any single fi xed disk failure? Can you recover your system if all the fi xed disks should fail? Could you recover your system if you lost your backup diskettes or tape to fi re or theft? If data were lost, how dif fi cult would it be to re-create it? Think through possible, even unlikely, major losses, and design a backup policy that enables you to recover your system after any of them.

## Â· Check your backups periodically.

Backup media and their hardware can be unreliable. A large library of backup tapes or diskettes is useless if data cannot be read back onto a fi xed disk. To make certain that your backups are usable, display the table of contents from the backup tape periodically (using restore -T or tar -t for archive tapes). If you use diskettes for your backups and have more than one diskette drive, read diskettes from a drive other than the one on which they were created. You might want the security of repeating each level 0 backup with a second set of media. If you use a streaming tape device for backups, you can use the tapechk command to perform rudimentary consistency checks on the tape. For more information about these commands, see restore -T , tar -t , and tapechk .

- Keep old backups.

Develop a regular cycle for reusing your backup media; however, do not reuse all of your backup media. Sometimes it is months before you or some other user of your system notices that an important fi le is damaged or missing. Save old backups for such possibilities. For example, you could have the following three cycles of backup tapes or diskettes:

- Once per week, recycle all daily diskettes except the Friday diskette.
- Once per month, recycle all Friday diskettes except for the one from the last Friday of the month. This makes the last four Friday backups always available.
- Once per quarter, recycle all monthly diskettes except for the last one. Keep the last monthly diskette from each quarter inde fi nitely, preferably in a different building.

## Â· Check fi le systems before backing up.

A backup made from a damaged fi le system might be useless. Before making your backups, it is good policy to check the integrity of the fi le system with the fsck command. For more information, see fsck .

## Â· Ensure fi les are not in use during a backup.

Do not use the system when you make your backups. If the system is in use, fi les can change while they are being backed up, and the backup copy will not be accurate.

## Â· Back up your system before major changes are made to the system.

It is always good policy to back up your entire system before any hardware testing or repair work is performed or before you install any new devices, programs, or other system features.

## Â· Other factors.

When planning and implementing a backup strategy, consider the following factors:

- How often does the data change? The operating system data does not change very often, so you do not need to back it up frequently. User data, on the other hand, usually changes frequently, so you should back it up frequently.
- How many users are on the system? The number of users affects the amount of storage media and frequency required for backups.
- How dif fi cult would it be to re-create the data? It is important to consider that some data cannot be re-created if there is no backup available.

Having a backup strategy in place to preserve your data is very important. Evaluating the needs of your site will help you to determine the backup policy that is best for you. Perform user information backups frequently and regularly. Recovering from data loss is very dif fi cult if a good backup strategy has not been implemented.

Note: For the backup of named pipes (FIFO special fi les) the pipes can be either closed or open. However, the restoration fails when the backup is done on open named pipes. When restoring a FIFO special fi le, its i-node is all that is required to recreate it because it contains all its characteristic information. The content of the named pipe is not relevant for restoration. Therefore, the fi le size during backup is zero (all the FIFOs closed) before the backup is made.

<!-- image -->

Attention: System backup and restoration procedures require that the system be restored on the same type of platform from which the backup was made. In particular, the CPU and I/O planar boards must be of the same type.

## Backup media

Several different types of backup media are available. The different types of backup media available to your speci fi c system con fi guration depend upon both your software and hardware.

Several types of backup media are available. The types of backup media available to your speci fi c system con fi guration depend upon your software and hardware. The types most frequently used are tapes (8-mm tape and 9-track tape), diskettes (5.25-inch diskette and 3.5-inch diskette), remote archives, and alternate local hard disks. Unless you specify a different device using the backup -f command, the backup command automatically writes its output to /dev/rfd0 , which is the diskette drive.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Running the backup command results in the loss of all material previously stored on the selected backup medium.

## Diskettes

Diskettes are the standard backup medium. Unless you specify a different device using the backup -f command, the backup command automatically writes its output to the /dev/rfd0 device, which is the diskette drive. To back up data to the default tape device, type /dev/rmt0 and press Enter.

Be careful when you handle diskettes. Because each piece of information occupies such a small area on the diskette, small scratches, dust, food, or tobacco particles can make the information unusable. Be sure to remember the following:

- Do not touch the recording surfaces.
- Keep diskettes away from magnets and magnetic fi eld sources, such as telephones, dictation equipment, and electronic calculators.
- Keep diskettes away from extreme heat and cold. The recommended temperature range is 10 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Proper care helps prevent loss of information.
- Make backup copies of your diskettes regularly.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Diskette drives and diskettes must be the correct type to store data successfully. If you use the wrong diskette in your 3.5-inch diskette drive, the data on the diskette could be destroyed.

The diskette drive uses the following 3.5-inch diskettes:

- 1 MB capacity (stores approximately 720 KB of data)
- 2 MB capacity (stores approximately 1.44 MB of data)

## Tapes

Because of their high capacity and durability, tapes are often chosen for storing large fi les or many fi les, such as archive copies of fi le systems. They are also used for transferring many fi les from one system to another. Tapes are not widely used for storing frequently accessed fi les because other media provide much faster access times.

Tape fi les are created using commands such as backup , cpio , and tar , which open a tape drive, write to it, and close it.

## Backup strategy

There are two methods of backing up large amounts of data.

- Complete system backup
- Incremental backup

To understand these two types of backups and which one is right for a site or system, it is important to have an understanding of fi le system structure and data placement. After you have decided on a strategy for data placement, you can develop a backup strategy for that data.

## Related tasks

## Implementing scheduled backups

This procedure describes how to develop and use a script to perform a weekly full backup and daily incremental backups of user fi les.

System data versus user data

Data is de fi ned as programs or text and for this discussion is broken down into two classes:

- System data, which makes up the operating system and its extensions. This data is always to be kept in the system fi le systems, namely / (root), /usr , /tmp , /var , and so on.
- User data is typically local data that individuals need to complete their speci fi c tasks. This data is to be kept in the /home fi le system or in fi le systems that are created speci fi cally for user data.

User programs and text are not to be placed in fi le systems designed to contain system data. For example, a system manager might create a new fi le system and mount it over /local . An exception is /tmp , which is used for temporary storage of system and user data.

## Backups

In general, backups of user and system data are kept in case the data is accidentally removed or if there is a disk failure. It is easier to manage backups when user data is kept separate from system data.

The following are reasons for keeping system data separate from user data:

- User data tends to change much more often than operating system data. Backup images are much smaller if the system data is not backed up into the same image as the user data. The number of users affects the storage media and frequency that is required for backup.
- It is quicker and easier to restore user data when it is kept separate. Restoring the operating system along with the user data requires extra time and effort. The reason is that the method that is used to recover the operating system data involves starting the system from removable media (tape or CD) and installing the system backup.

To back up the system data, unmount all user fi le systems, including /home with the umount command. If these fi le systems are in use, you cannot unmount them. Schedule the backups at low usage times so they can be unmounted; if the user data fi le systems remain mounted, they are backed up along with the operating system data. Use the mount command to ensure that only the operating system fi le systems are mounted.

The only mounted fi le systems are / , /usr , /var , and /tmp , and the result of the mount command can be similar to the following output:

| node   | mounted     | mounted over   | vfs   | date         | options         |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
|        | /dev/hd4    | /              | jfs   | Jun 11 10:36 | rw,log=/dev/hd8 |
|        | /dev/hd2    | /usr           | jfs   | Jun 11 10:36 | rw,log=/dev/hd8 |
|        | /dev/hd9var | /var           | jfs   | Jun 11 10:36 | rw,log=/dev/hd8 |
|        | /dev/hd     | /tmp           | jfs   | Jun 11 10:36 | rw,log=/dev/hd8 |

After you are certain that all user fi le systems are unmounted, you are now ready to back up the operating system data.

When you fi nish backing up the operating system, mount the user fi le system by using the smit mount command. Next, you can back up fi les, fi le systems, or other volume groups, depending on your needs.

## Related concepts

## System image and user-de fi ned volume groups backup

The rootvg is stored on a hard disk, or group of disks, and contains start up fi les, the BOS, con fi guration information, and any optional software products. A user-de fi ned volume group (also called nonrootvg volume group ) typically contains data fi les and application software.

## System replication (cloning)

Cloning saves con fi guration data along with user or system data. For example, you might want to replicate a system or volume group; it is sometimes called cloning.

You can then install this image onto another system and can use it just like the fi rst system. The mksysb command is used to clone the rootvg volume group, which contains the operating system, while the savevg command is used to clone a volume group.

## Administering system backups

There are multiple ways to backup your system and restore a system backup.

## Backing up user fi les or fi le systems

Two procedures can be used to back up fi les and fi le systems: the SMIT fast paths smit backfile or smit backfilesys , and the backup command.

- If you are backing up by i-node fi le systems that may be in use, unmount them fi rst to prevent inconsistencies.

<!-- image -->

Attention: If you attempt to back up a mounted fi le system, a warning message is displayed. The backup command continues, but inconsistencies in the fi le system may occur. This warning does not apply to the root ( / ) fi le system.

- To prevent errors, make sure the backup device has been cleaned recently.

To back up user fi les and fi le systems, you can use the SMIT fast paths smit backfile or smit backfilesys .

You can use the SMIT interface for backing up single and small fi le systems by name, such as /home on your local system. Note that SMIT cannot make archives in any other format than that provided by the backup command. Also, not every flag of the backup command is available through SMIT. SMIT might hang if multiple tapes or disks are needed during the backup.

Use the backup command when you want to back up large and multiple fi le systems. You can specify a level number to control how much data is backed up (full, 0; incremental, 1-9). Using the backup command is the only way you can specify the level number on backups.

The backup command creates copies in one of the two following backup formats:

- Speci fi c fi les backed up by name using the -i flag.
- Entire fi le systems backed up by i-node using the -Level and FileSystem parameters. The fi le system is defragmented when it is restored from backup.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Backing up by i-node does not work correctly for fi les that have a user ID (UID) or a group ID (GID) greater than 65535. These fi les are backed up with UID or GID truncated and will, therefore, have the wrong UID or GID attributes when restored. For these cases, you must back up by name.

Note: If this command generates an error message, you must repeat the entire backup.

## Related concepts

## System backup

Once your system is in use, your next consideration should be to back up the fi le systems, directories, and fi les. If you back up your fi le systems, you can restore fi les or fi le systems in the event of a hard disk crash. There are different methods for backing up information.

## Restoring backed-up fi les

After the data has been correctly backed up, there are several different methods of restoring the data based upon the type of backup command you used.

You need to know how your backup or archive was created to restore it correctly. Each backup procedure gives information about restoring data. For example, if you use the backup command, you can specify a backup either by fi le system or by name. That backup must be restored the way it was done, by fi le system or by name.

Several commands restore backed up data, such as:

| Item     | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| restore  | Copies fi les created by the backup command. For more information about using this command, see the "Restoring fi les using the restore command' section below. |
| rrestore | Copies fi le systems backed up on a remote machine to the local machine.                                                                                        |
| cpio     | Copies fi les into and out of archive storage.                                                                                                                  |
| tar      | Creates or manipulates tar archives.                                                                                                                            |
| pax      | (POSIX-conformant archive utility) Reads and writes tar and cpio archives.                                                                                      |

The following sections discuss the restore and smit commands.

## Note:

- Files must be restored using the same method by which they were backed up. For example, if a fi le system was backed up by name, it must be restored by name.

- When more than one diskette is required, the restore command reads the diskette that is mounted, prompts you for a new one, and waits for your response. After inserting the new diskette, press the Enter key to continue restoring fi les.

## Restoring fi les using the restore command

Use the restore command to read fi les written by the backup command and restore them on your local system.

See the following examples:

- To list the names of fi les previously backed up, type the following:

```
restore -T
```

Information is read from the /dev/rfd0 default backup device. If individual fi les are backed up, only the fi le names are displayed. If an entire fi le system is backed up, the i-node number is also shown.

- To restore fi les to the main fi le system, type the following:

```
restore -x -v
```

The -x flag extracts all the fi les from the backup media and restores them to their proper places in the fi le system. The -v flag displays a progress report as each fi le is restored. If a fi le system backup is being restored, the fi les are named with their i-node numbers. Otherwise, only the names are displayed.

- To copy the /home/mike/manual/chap1 fi le, type the following:

```
restore -xv /home/mike/manual/chap1
```

This command extracts the /home/mike/manual/chap1 fi le from the backup medium and restores it. The /home/mike/manual/chap1 fi le must be a name that the restore -T command can display.

- To copy all the fi les in a directory named manual , type the following:

```
restore -xdv manual
```

This command restores the manual directory and the fi les in it. If the directory does not exist, a directory named manual is created in the current directory to hold the fi les being restored.

## Restoring fi les using the smit command

Use the smit command to run the restore command, which reads fi les written by the backup command and restores them on your local system.

1. At the prompt, type the following:
2. Make your entry in the Target DIRECTORY fi eld. This is the directory where you want the restored fi les to reside.
3. Proceed to the BACKUP device or FILE fi eld and enter the output device name, as in the following example for a raw magnetic tape device:

```
smit restore
```

```
/dev/rmt0 If the device is not available, a message similar to the following is displayed: Cannot open /dev/rmtX, no such file or directory.
```

This message indicates that the system cannot reach the device driver because there is no fi le for rmtX in the /dev directory. Only items in the available state are in the /dev directory.

4. For the NUMBER of blocks to read in a single input fi eld, the default is recommended.

5. Press Enter to restore the speci fi ed fi le system or directory.

## Creating a remote archive

Use this procedure to archive fi les to a remote tape device.

Running AIX systems cannot mount a remote tape device as if it were local to the system; however, data can be sent to a remote machine tape device using the rsh command. The following procedure writes to a single tape only. Multiple-tape archives require specialized application software.

In the following procedure, assume the following:

## blocksize

Represents the target tape device blocksize.

## remotehost

Is the name of the target system (the system that has the tape drive).

## sourcehost

Is the name of the source system (the system being archived).

## /dev/rmt0

Is the name of the remote tape device

## pathname

Represents the full pathname of a required directory or fi le.

When using the following instructions, assume that both the local and remote user is root.

1. Ensure you have access to the remote machine.
2. The source machine must have access to the system with the tape drive. (The target system can be accessed using any of the de fi ned users on that system, but the user name must have root authority to do many of the following steps.)
2. Using your favorite editor, create a fi le in the / (root) directory of the target system called .rhosts that allows the source system access to the target system.
4. You need to add the authorized host name and user ID to this fi le. To determine the name of the source machine for the .rhosts fi le, you can use the following command:

host SourceIPaddress

For the purposes of this example, assume you add the following line to the .rhosts fi le:

```
sourcehost.mynet.com root
```

3. Save the fi le and then change its permissions using the following command:
4. Use the rsh command to test your access from the source machine. For example:

```
chmod 600 .rhosts
```

rsh remotehost

If everything is set up correctly, you should be granted shell access to the remote machine. You should not see a login prompt asking for a user name. Type exit to log out of this test shell.

5. Decide on the appropriate tape device blocksize.

The following are the recommended values:

## Item

Description

9-track or 0.25-in. media blocksize:

512

8-mm or 4-mm media blocksize:

1024

If you are unsure and want to check the current block size of the tape device, use the tctl command. For example:

```
tctl -f /dev/rmt0 status If you want to change the tape blocksize, use the chdev command. For example: chdev -l rmt0 -a block_size=1024
```

6. Create your archive using one of the following methods:

## Backup by Name

To remotely create a backup archive by name, use the following command:

```
find pathname -print | backup -ivqf-| rsh remotehost \ "dd of=/dev/rmt0 bs= blocksize conv=sync"
```

## Backup by inode

To remotely create a backup archive by inode, fi rst unmount your fi le system then use the backup command. For example:

```
umount /myfs backup -0 -uf/myfs | rsh remotehost \ "dd of=/dev/rmt0 bs= blocksize conv=sync"
```

## Create and Copy an Archive to Remote Tape

To create and copy an archive to the remote tape device, use the following command:

```
find pathname -print | cpio -ovcB | rsh remotehost \ "dd ibs=5120 obs= blocksize of=/dev/rmt0"
```

## Create a tar Archive

To remotely create a tar archive, use the following command:

```
tar -cvdfpathname | rsh remotehost \ "dd of=/dev/rmt0 bs= blocksize conv=sync"
```

## Create a Remote Dump

To remotely create a remote dump of the /myfs fi le system, use the rdump command:

```
rdump -u -0 -f remotehost :/dev/rmt0 /myfs
```

The -u flag tells the system to update the current backup level records in the /etc/dumpdates fi le. The -0 is the setting of the Level flag. Backup level 0 speci fi es that all the fi les in the /myfs directory are to be backed up.

7. Restore your remote archive using one of the following methods:

## Restore a Backup by Name

To restore a remote backup archive by name, use the following command:

```
rsh remotehost "dd if=/dev/rmt0 bs= blocksize " | restore \ -xvqdfpathname
```

## Restore a Backup by inode

To restore a remote backup archive by inode, use the following command:

```
rsh remotehost "dd if=/dev/rmt0 bs= blocksize " | restore \ -xvqfpathname
```

## Restore a Remote cpio Archive

To restore a remote archive created with the cpio command, use the following command:

```
rsh remotehost "dd if=/dev/rmt0 ibs= blocksize obs=5120" | \ cpio -icvdumB
```

## Restore a tar Archive

To restore a remote tar archive, use the following command:

```
rsh remotehost "dd if=/dev/rmt0 bs= blocksize " | tar -xvpfpathname
```

## Restore a Remote Dump

To restore a remote dump of the /myfs fi le system, use the following command:

```
cd /myfs rrestore -rvf remotehost :/dev/rmt0
```

## Restoring user fi les from a backup image

If you need to restore a backup image destroyed by accident, your most dif fi cult problem is determining which of the backup tapes contains this fi le. The restore -T command can be used to list the contents of an archive. It is a good idea to restore the fi le in the /tmp directory so that you do not accidentally overwrite the user's other fi les.

Make sure the device is connected and available. To check availability, type:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

If the backup strategy included incremental backups, then it is helpful to fi nd out from the user when the fi le was most recently modi fi ed. This helps to determine which incremental backup contains the fi le. If this information cannot be obtained or is found to be incorrect, then start searching the incremental backups in reverse order (7, 6, 5, ...). For incremental fi le system backups, the -i flag (interactive mode) of the restore command is very useful in both locating and restoring the lost fi le. (Interactive mode is also useful for restoring an individual user's account from a backup of the /home fi le system.)

The procedures in the following table describe how to implement a level 0 (full) restoration of a directory or fi le system.

## Restoring access to an unlinked or deleted system library

When the existing libc.a library is not available, most operating system commands are not recognized.

The most likely causes for this type of problem are the following:

- The link in /usr/lib no longer exists.
- The fi le in /usr/ccs/lib has been deleted.

The following procedure describes how to restore access to the libc.a library. This procedure requires system downtime. If possible, schedule your downtime when it least impacts your workload to protect yourself from a possible loss of data or functionality.

The information in this how-to scenario was tested using speci fi c versions of AIX. The results you obtain might vary signi fi cantly depending on your version and level of AIX.

## Restoring a deleted symbolic link

Use the following procedure to restore a symbolic link from the /usr/lib/libc.a library to the /usr/ccs/lib/libc.a path.

The information in this how-to scenario was tested using speci fi c versions of AIX. The results you obtain might vary signi fi cantly depending on your version and level of AIX.

1. With root authority, set the LIBPATH environment variable to point to the /usr/ccs/lib directory by typing the following commands:

```
# LIBPATH=/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/lib # export LIBPATH
```

At this point, you should be able to execute system commands.

2. To restore the links from the /usr/lib/libc.a library and the /lib directory to the /usr/lib directory, type the following commands:

```
ln -s /usr/ccs/lib/libc.a /usr/lib/libc.a
```

```
ln -s /usr/lib /lib
```

At this point, commands should run as before. If you still do not have access to a shell, skip the rest of this procedure and continue with the next section, 'Restoring a deleted system library fi le' on page 30.

3. Type the following command to unset the LIBPATH environment variable.

```
unset LIBPATH
```

## Restoring a deleted system library fi le

This procedure to restore a deleted system library fi le requires system downtime. The system is booted and then the library is restored from a recent mksysb tape.

1. Before your reboot, ensure the PROMPT fi eld in the bosinst.data fi le is set to yes .
2. Insert a recent mksysb tape into the tape drive.
3. The mksysb must contain the same OS and maintenance package or technology level as the installed system. If you restore a libc.a library from a mksysb that conflicts with the level on the installed system, you will not be able to issue commands.
3. Reboot the machine.
4. When the screen of icons appears, or when you hear a double beep, press the F1 key repeatedly until the System Management Services menu is displayed.
5. Select Multiboot .
6. Select Install From .
7. Select the tape device that holds the mksysb and then select Install .
9. It can take several minutes before the next prompt appears.
8. De fi ne your current system as the system console by pressing the F1 key and press Enter.
9. Select the number of your preferred language and press Enter.
10. Select Start Maintenance Mode for System Recovery by typing 3 and press Enter.
11. Select Access a Root Volume Group . A message displays explaining that you will not be able to return to the Installation menus without rebooting if you change the root volume group at this point.
12. Type 0 and press Enter.
13. Type the number of the appropriate volume group from the list and press Enter.
14. Select Access this Volume Group by typing 2 and press Enter.
15. Mount the / (root) and /usr fi le systems by typing the following commands:

```
mount /dev/hd4 /mnt mount /dev/hd2 /mnt/usr cd /mnt
```

16. To restore the symbolic link for the libc.a library, if needed, type the following command:

```
ln -s /usr/ccs/lib/libc.a /mnt/usr/lib/libc.a
```

After the command runs, do one of the following:

- If the command is successful, skip to step 20.
- If a message displays that the link already exists, continue with step 17.
17. Set the block size of the tape drive by issuing the following commands, where X is the number of the appropriate tape drive.

```
tctl -f /dev/rmt X rewind tctl -f /dev/rmt X .1 fsf 1 restbyname -xvqf /dev/rmt X .1 ./tapeblksz cat tapeblksz
```

If the value from the cat tapeblksz command is not equal to 512, type the following commands, replacing Y with the value from the cat tapeblksz command:

```
ln -sf /mnt/usr/lib/methods /etc/methods /etc/methods/chgdevn -l rmt X -a block_size= Y
```

You should receive a message that rmt X has been changed.

18. Ensure the tape is at the correct location for restoring the library by typing the following commands (where X is the number of the appropriate tape drive):
19. Restore the missing library using one of the following commands (where X is the number of the appropriate tape drive):
- To restore the libc.a library only, type the following command:
- To restore the /usr/ccs/lib directory, type the following command:
- To restore the /usr/ccs/bin directory, type the following command:
20. Flush the data to disk by typing the following commands:
21. Unmount the /usr and / (root) fi le systems by typing the following commands:

```
tctl -f /dev/rmt X rewind tctl -f /dev/rmt X .1 fsf 3
```

```
restbyname -xvqf /dev/rmt X .1 ./usr/ccs/lib/libc.a
```

```
restbyname -xvqf /dev/rmt X .1 ./usr/ccs/lib
```

```
restbyname -xvqf /dev/rmt X .1 ./usr/ccs/bin
```

```
cd /mnt/usr/sbin ./sync;./sync;./sync
```

```
cd / umount /dev/hd2 umount /dev/hd4
```

If either umount command fails, cycle power on this machine and begin this procedure again.

22. Reboot the system by typing the following command:

reboot

After the system is rebooted, operating system commands should be available.

## Recreating a corrupted boot image

The following procedure describes how to identify a corrupted boot image and re-create it.

If your machine is currently running and you know the boot image has been corrupted or deleted, recreate the boot image by running the bosboot command with root authority.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Never reboot the system when you suspect the boot image is corrupted.

The following procedure assumes your system is not rebooting correctly because of a corrupted boot image. If possible, protect your system from a possible loss of data or functionality by scheduling your downtime when it least impacts your workload.

The information in this how-to scenario was tested using speci fi c versions of AIX. The results you obtain might vary signi fi cantly depending on your version and level of AIX.

1. Insert the product media into the appropriate drive.
2. Power on the machine following the instructions provided with your system.
3. From the System Management Services menu, select Multiboot .
4. From the next screen, select Install From .
5. Select the device that holds the product media and then select Install .
6. Select the AIX version icon.
7. Follow the online instructions until you can select which mode you use for installation. At that point, select Start Maintenance Mode for System Recovery .
8. Select Access a Root Volume Group .
9. Follow the online instructions until you can select Access this Volume Group and start a shell .
10. Use the bosboot command to re-create the boot image. For example:

```
bosboot -a -d /dev/hdisk0 If the command fails and you receive the following message: 0301-165 bosboot: WARNING! bosboot failed -do not attempt to boot device.
```

Try to resolve the problem using one of the following options, and then run the bosboot command again until you have successfully created a boot image:

- Delete the default boot logical volume (hd5) and then create a new hd5.

Or

- Run diagnostics on the hard disk. Repair or replace, as necessary.

If the bosboot command continues to fail, contact your customer support representative.

<!-- image -->

Attention: If the bosboot command fails while creating a boot image, do not reboot your machine.

11. When the bosboot command is successful, use the reboot command to reboot your system.

## Making an online backup of a JFS

Making an online backup of a mounted journaled fi le system (JFS) or enhanced journaled fi le system (JFS2) creates a static image of the logical volume that contains the fi le system.

To make an online backup of a mounted JFS, the logical volume that the fi le system resides on and the logical volume that its log resides on must be mirrored.

Note: Because the fi le writes are asynchronous, the split-off copy might not contain all data that was written immediately before the split. Any modi fi cations that begin after the split begins might not be present in the backup copy. Therefore, it is recommended that fi le system activity be minimal while the split is taking place.

The information in this how-to scenario was tested using speci fi c versions of AIX. The results you obtain might vary signi fi cantly depending on your version and level of AIX.

To split off a mirrored copy of the /home/xyz fi le system to a new mount point named / jfsstaticcopy , type the following:

```
chfs -a splitcopy=/jfsstaticcopy /home/xyz
```

You can control which mirrored copy is used as the backup by using the copy attribute. The second mirrored copy is the default if a copy is not speci fi ed by the user. For example:

```
chfs -a splitcopy=/jfsstaticcopy -a copy=1 /home/xyz
```

At this point, a read-only copy of the fi le system is available in /jfsstaticcopy . Any changes made to the original fi le system after the copy is split off are not reflected in the backup copy.

To reintegrate the JFS split image as a mirrored copy at the /testcopy mount point, use the following command:

```
rmfs /testcopy
```

The rmfs command removes the fi le system copy from its split-off state and allows it to be reintegrated as a mirrored copy.

## Making and backing up a snapshot of a JFS2

You can make a snapshot of a mounted JFS2 that establishes a consistent block-level image of the fi le system at a point in time.

The information in this how-to scenario was tested using speci fi c versions of AIX. The results you obtain might vary signi fi cantly depending on your version and level of AIX.

The snapshot image remains stable even as the fi le system that was used to create the snapshot, called the snappedFS , continues to change. The snapshot retains the same security permissions as the snappedFS had when the snapshot was made.

In the following scenario, you create a snapshot and back up the snapshot to removable media without unmounting or quiescing the fi le system, all with one command: backsnap . You can also use the snapshot for other purposes, such as accessing the fi les or directories as they existed when the snapshot was taken. You can do the various snapshot procedures by using SMIT or the backsnap and snapshot commands.

To create a snapshot of the /home/abc/test fi le system and back it up (by name) to the tape device /dev/rmt0 , use the following command:

```
backsnap -m /tmp/snapshot -s size=16M -i f/dev/rmt0 /home/abc/test
```

This command creates a logical volume of 16 megabytes for the snapshot of the JFS2 fi le system ( / home/abc/test ). The snapshot is mounted on /tmp/snapshot and then a backup by name of the snapshot is made to the tape device. After the backup completes, the snapshot remains mounted. Use the -R flag with the backsnap command if you want the snapshot removed when the backup completes.

## Making and backing up an external snapshot of a JFS2

You can make a snapshot of a mounted JFS2 that establishes a consistent block-level image of the fi le system at a point in time.

The snapshot image remains stable even as the fi le system that was used to create the snapshot, called the snappedFS , continues to change. The snapshot retains the same security permissions as the snappedFS had when the snapshot was made.

In the following scenario, you use the backsnap command to create an external snapshot and back up the snapshot to removable media without un mounting or quiescing the fi le system. You can also use the snapshot for other purposes, such as accessing the fi les or directories as they existed when the snapshot was taken. You can do the various snapshot procedures using SMIT, or the backsnap and snapshot commands.

To create an external snapshot of the /home/abc/test fi le system and back it up, by name, to the /dev/rmt0 tape device, run the following command:

```
backsnap -m /tmp/snapshot -s size=16M -if/dev/rmt0 /home/abc/test
```

The previous command creates a logical volume of 16 MB for the snapshot of the /home/abc/test JFS2 fi le system. The snapshot is mounted on the /tmp/snapshot directory and then a backup of the snapshot, by name, is made to the tape device. After the backup is complete, the snapshot is unmounted but remains available. Use the -R flag with the backsnap command if you want the snapshot removed when the backup is completed.

## Making and backing up an internal snapshot of a JFS2

You can make a snapshot of a mounted JFS2 that establishes a consistent block-level image of the fi le system at a point in time.

The snapshot image remains stable even as the fi le system that was used to create the snapshot, called the snappedFS , continues to change. The snapshot retains the same security permissions as the snappedFS had when the snapshot was made.

In the following scenario, you use the backsnap command to create an internal snapshot and back up the snapshot to removable media without un mounting or quiescing the fi le system. You can also use the snapshot for other purposes, such as accessing the fi les or directories as they existed when the snapshot was taken. You can do the various snapshot procedures using SMIT, or the backsnap and snapshot commands.

To create an internal snapshot of the /home/abc/test fi le system and back it up, by name, to the /dev/ rmt0 tape device , run the following command:

```
backsnap -n mysnapshot -if/dev/rmt0 /home/abc/test
```

The previous command creates an internal snapshot, named mysnapshot , of the /home/abc/test fi le system. The snapshot is accessed from the /home/abc/test/.snapshot/mysnapshot directory and then a backup is made to the tape device. Use the -R flag with the backsnap command if you want the snapshot removed after the backup is completed.

## Compressing fi les (compress and pack commands)

Use the compress command and the pack command to compress fi les for storage.

Use the uncompress command and the unpack command to expand the restored fi les.

The process of compressing and expanding fi les takes time; however, after the fi les are packed, the data uses less space on the backup medium.

To compress a fi le system, use one of the following methods:

- Use the -p flag with the backup command.
- Use the compress or pack commands.

Advantages for compressing fi les include:

- Saving money and time by compressing fi les before sending them over a network.
- Saving storage and archiving system resources:
- Compress fi le systems before making backups to preserve tape space.
- Compress log fi les created by shell scripts that run at night; it is easy to have the script compress the fi le before it exits.
- Compress fi les that are not currently being accessed. For example, the fi les belonging to a user who is away for extended leave can be compressed and placed into a tar archive on disk or to a tape and later be restored.

## Note:

- The compress command might run out of working space in the fi le system while compressing. The command creates the compressed fi les before it deletes any of the uncompressed fi les, so it needs a space about 50% larger than the total size of the fi les.
- A fi le might fail to compress because it is already compressed. If the compress command cannot reduce fi le sizes, the command fails.

See the compress command for details about the return values but, in general, the problems encountered when compressing fi les can be summarized as follows:

- The command might run out of working space in the fi le system while compressing. Because the compress command creates the compressed fi les before it deletes any of the uncompressed fi les, it needs extra space-from 50% to 100% of the size of any given fi le.
- A fi le might fail to compress because it is already compressed. If the compress command cannot reduce the fi le size, it fails.

Compressing fi les using the compress command Use the compress command to reduce the size of fi les using adaptive Lempel-Zev coding.

Each original fi le speci fi ed by the File parameter is replaced by a compressed fi le with a .Z appended to its name. The compressed fi le retains the same ownership, modes, and access and modi fi cation times of the original fi le. If no fi les are speci fi ed, the standard input is compressed to the standard output. If compression does not reduce the size of a fi le, a message is written to standard error and the original fi le is not replaced.

Use the uncompress command to restore compressed fi les to their original form.

The amount of compression depends on the size of the input, the number of bits per code speci fi ed by the Bits variable, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, source code or English text is reduced by 50 to 60 percent. The compression of the compress command is generally more compact and takes less time to compute than the compression achieved by the pack command, which uses adaptive Huffman coding.

For example, to compress the foo fi le and write the percentage compression to standard error, type the following:

compress -v foo

Compressing fi les using the pack command

Use the pack command to store the fi le or fi les speci fi ed by the File parameter in a compressed form using Huffman coding.

The input fi le is replaced by a packed fi le with a name derived from the original fi le name ( File .z ), with the same access modes, access and modi fi cation dates, and owner as the original fi le. The input fi le name can contain no more than 253 bytes to allow space for the added .z suf fi x. If the pack command is successful, the original fi le is removed.

Use the unpack command to restore packed fi les to their original form.

If the pack command cannot create a smaller fi le, it stops processing and reports that it is unable to save space. (A failure to save space generally happens with small fi les or fi les with uniform character distribution.) The amount of space saved depends on the size of the input fi le and the character frequency distribution. Because a decoding tree forms the fi rst part of each . z fi le, you do not save space with fi les smaller than three blocks. Typically, text fi les are reduced 25 to 40 percent.

The exit value of the pack command is the number of fi les that it could not pack. Packing is not done under any of the following conditions:

- The fi le is already packed.
- The input fi le name has more than 253 bytes.
- The fi le has links.
- The fi le is a directory.
- The fi le cannot be opened.
- No storage blocks are saved by packing.
- A fi le named File .z already exists.
- The .z fi le cannot be created.
- An I/O error occurred during processing.

For example, to compress the fi les chap1 and chap2 , type the following:

```
pack chap1 chap2
```

This compresses chap1 and chap2 and replaces them with fi les named chap1.z and chap2.z . The pack command displays the percent decrease in size for each fi le.

Expanding compressed fi les (uncompress and unpack commands) Use the uncompress and unpack commands to expand compressed fi les.

## Expanding fi les using the uncompress command

Use the uncompress command to restore original fi les that were compressed by the compress command. Each compressed fi le speci fi ed by the File variable is removed and replaced by an expanded copy. The expanded fi le has the same name as the compressed version but without the .Z extension. The expanded fi le retains the same ownership, modes, and access and modi fi cation times as the original fi le. If no fi les are speci fi ed, standard input is expanded to standard output.

Although similar to the uncompress command, the zcat command always writes the expanded output to standard output.

For example, to uncompress the foo fi le, type the following:

```
uncompress foo
```

## Expanding fi les using the unpack command

Use the unpack command to expand fi les created by the pack command. For each fi le speci fi ed, the unpack command searches for a fi le called File .z . If this fi le is a packed fi le, the unpack command replaces it with its expanded version. The unpack command renames the new fi le by removing the .z

suf fi x from File . The new fi le has the same access modes, access and modi fi cation dates, and owner as the original packed fi le.

The unpack command operates only on fi les ending in .z . As a result, when you specify a fi le name that does not end in .z , the unpack command adds the suf fi x and searches the directory for a fi le name with that suf fi x.

The exit value is the number of fi les that the unpack command was unable to unpack. A fi le cannot be unpacked if any of the following situations exists:

- The fi le name (exclusive of .z ) has more than 253 bytes.
- The fi le cannot be opened.
- The fi le is not a packed fi le.
- A fi le with the unpacked fi le name already exists.
- The unpacked fi le cannot be created.

Note: The unpack command writes a warning to standard error if the fi le it is unpacking has links. The new unpacked fi le has a different i-node (index node) number than the packed fi le from which it was created. However, any other fi les linked to the original i-node number of the packed fi le still exist and are still packed.

For example, to unpack the packed fi les chap1.z and chap2.z , type the following:

```
unpack chap1.z chap2
```

This expands the packed fi les chap1.z and chap2.z , and replaces them with fi les named chap1 and chap2 .

Note: You can provide the unpack command with fi le names with or without the .z suf fi x.

## System image and user-de fi ned volume groups backup

The rootvg is stored on a hard disk, or group of disks, and contains start up fi les, the BOS, con fi guration information, and any optional software products. A user-de fi ned volume group (also called nonrootvg volume group ) typically contains data fi les and application software.

You can backup an image of the system and volume groups using, SMIT, or command procedures. A backup image serves two purposes. One is to restore a corrupted system using the system backup image. The other is to transfer installed and con fi gured software from one system to others.

The SMIT procedures use the mksysb command to create a backup image that can be stored either on tape or in a fi le. If you choose tape, the backup program writes a boot image to the tape, which makes it suitable for installing.

## Note:

- Startup tapes cannot be made on or used to start a PowerPC-based personal computer.
- If you choose the SMIT method for backup, you must fi rst install the sysbr fi leset in the bos.sysmgt software package.

## Related concepts

## Backups

In general, backups of user and system data are kept in case the data is accidentally removed or if there is a disk failure. It is easier to manage backups when user data is kept separate from system data.

## Backing up the system image and user-de fi ned volume groups

You can make backups of the system image and the user-de fi ned volume groups.

Before backing up the rootvg volume group:

- All hardware must already be installed, including external devices, such as tape and CD-ROM drives.

- This backup procedure requires the sysbr fi leset, which is in the BOS System Management Tools and Applications software package. Type the following command to determine whether the sysbr fi leset is installed on your system:

```
lslpp -l bos.sysmgt.sysbr
```

If your system has the sysbr fi leset installed, continue the backup procedures.

If the lslpp command does not list the sysbr fi leset, install it before continuing with the backup procedure.

installp -agqXd device bos.sysmgt.sysbr where device is the location of the software; for example, /dev/rmt0 for a tape drive.

Before backing up a user-de fi ned volume group:

- Before being saved, a volume group must be varied on and the fi le systems must be mounted.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Executing the savevg command results in the loss of all material previously stored on the selected output medium.

- Make sure the backup device has been cleaned recently to prevent errors.

The following procedures describe how to make an installable image of your system.

## Note:

1. The mksysb command does not back up fi le systems mounted across an NFS network.

2. The mksysb command requires this working space for the duration of the backup. Use the df command, which reports in units of 512-byte blocks, to determine the free space in the /tmp directory. Use the chfs command to change the size of the fi le system, if necessary.
3. This procedure lists the contents of a mksysb backup tape. The contents list veri fi es most of the information on the tape but does not verify that the tape can be booted for installations. The only way to verify that the boot image on a mksysb tape functions correctly is by booting from the tape.
4. If you want to exclude fi les in a user-de fi ned volume group from the backup image, create a fi le named /etc/exclude. volume\_group\_name , where volume\_group\_name is the name of the volume group that you want to back up. Then edit /etc/exclude. volume\_group\_name and enter the patterns of fi le names that you do not want included in your backup image. The patterns in this fi le are input to the pattern matching conventions of the grep command to determine which fi les are excluded from the backup.
5. If you choose to modify the VGName .data fi le to alter the size of a fi le system, you must not specify the -i flag or the -m flag with the savevg command, because the VGName .data fi le is overwritten.

## Pre-backup con fi guration

Con fi gure the source system before creating a backup image of it. If, however, you plan to use a backup image for installing other, differently con fi gured target systems, create the image before con fi guring the source system.

The source system is the system from which you created the backup copy. The target system is the system on which you are installing the backup copy.

The installation program automatically installs only the device support required for the hardware con fi guration of the installed machine. Therefore, if you are using a system backup to install other machines, you might need to install additional devices on the source system before making the backup image and using it to install one or more target systems.

Use the SMIT fast path, smit devinst , to install additional device support on the source system.

- If there is suf fi cient disk space on the source and target systems, install all device support.
- If there is limited disk space on the source and target systems, selectively install device support.

A backup transfers the following con fi gurations from the source system to the target system:

- Paging space information
- Logical volume information
- rootvg information
- Placement of logical partitions (if you have selected the map option).

## Related information

Installing optional software and service updates Customizing your installation

## File system mounts and unmounts

Before performing a backup, you must mount all fi le systems you want to back up and unmount all fi le systems you do not want to back up.

The Backup Methods procedure backs up only mounted fi le systems in the rootvg. You must, therefore, mount all fi le systems you want to back up before starting. Similarly, you must unmount fi le systems you do not want backed up.

This backup procedure backs up fi les twice if a local directory is mounted over another local directory in the same fi le system. For example, if you mount /tmp over /usr/tmp , the fi les in the /tmp directory

are backed up twice. This duplication might exceed the number of fi les a fi le system can hold, which can cause a future installation of the backup image to fail.

## Security considerations for backups

If you install the backup image on other systems, you might not, for security reasons, want passwords and network addresses copied to the target systems.

Also, copying network addresses to a target system creates duplicate addresses that can disrupt network communications.

## Backup image restoration

When installing the backup image, the system checks whether the target system has enough disk space to create all the logical volumes stored on the backup. If there is enough space, the entire backup is recovered. Otherwise, the installation halts and the system prompts you to choose more destination hard disks.

File systems created on the target system are the same size as they were on the source system, unless the SHRINK variable was set to yes in the image.data fi le before the backup image was made. An exception is the /tmp directory, which can be increased to allocate enough space for the bosboot command. For information about setting variables, see the image.data fi le.

When the system fi nishes installing the backup image, the installation program recon fi gures the ODM on the target system. If the target system does not have exactly the same hardware con fi guration as the source system, the program might modify device attributes in the following target system fi les:

- All fi les in /etc/objrepos beginning with Cu
- All fi les in the /dev directory.

## Implementing scheduled backups

This procedure describes how to develop and use a script to perform a weekly full backup and daily incremental backups of user fi les.

- The amount of data scheduled for backup cannot exceed one tape when using this script.
- Make sure the tape is loaded in the backup device before the cron command runs the script.
- Make sure the device is connected and available, especially when using scripts that run at night. Use the lsdev -C | pg command to check availability.
- Make sure the backup device has been cleaned recently to prevent errors.
- If you are backing up fi le systems that might be in use, unmount them fi rst to prevent fi le system corruption.
- Check the fi le system before making the backup. Use the procedure described in File system veri fi cation or run the fsck command.

The script included in this procedure is intended only as a model and needs to be carefully tailored to the needs of the speci fi c site.

## Related concepts

## Backup strategy

There are two methods of backing up large amounts of data.

## Backing up fi le systems using the cron command

This procedure describes how to write a crontab script that you can pass to the cron command for execution.

The script backs up two user fi le systems, /home/plan and /home/run , on Monday through Saturday nights. Both fi le systems are backed up on one tape, and each morning a new tape is inserted for the next night. The Monday night backups are full archives (level 0). The backups on Tuesday through Saturday are incremental backups.

1. The fi rst step in making the crontab script is to issue the crontab -e command. This opens an empty fi le where you can make the entries that are submitted to the cron script for execution each night (the default editor is vi ). Type:

crontab

-e

2. The following example shows the six crontab fi elds. Field 1 is for the minute, fi eld 2 is for the hour on a 24-hour clock, fi eld 3 is for the day of the month, and fi eld 4 is for the month of the year. Fields 3 and 4 contain an * (asterisk) to show that the script runs every month on the day speci fi ed in the day/wk fi eld. Field 5 is for the day of the week, and can also be speci fi ed with a range of days, for example, 1-6. Field 6 is for the shell command being run.

```
min hr day/mo mo/yr day/wk shell command
```

```
0 2 * * 1 backup -0 -uf /dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan
```

The command line shown assumes that personnel at the site are available to respond to prompts when appropriate. The -0 (zero) flag for the backup command stands for level zero, or full backup. The -u flag updates the backup record in the /etc/dumpdates fi le and the f flag speci fi es the device name, a raw magnetic tape device 0.1 as in the example above.

3. Type a line similar to that in step 2 for each fi le system backed up on a speci fi c day. The following example shows a full script that performs six days of backups on two fi le systems:
4. Save the fi le you created and exit the editor. The operating system passes the crontab fi le to the cron script.

```
0 2 * * 1 backup -0 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan 0 3 * * 1 backup -0 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/run 0 2 * * 2 backup -1 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan 0 3 * * 2 backup -1 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/run 0 2 * * 3 backup -2 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan 0 3 * * 3 backup -2 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/run 0 2 * * 4 backup -3 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan 0 3 * * 4 backup -3 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/run 0 2 * * 5 backup -4 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan 0 3 * * 5 backup -4 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/run 0 2 * * 6 backup -5 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan 0 3 * * 6 backup -5 -uf/dev/rmt0.1 /home/run
```

## Backup of fi les on a DMAPI-managed JFS2 fi le system

There are options in the tar and backbyinode commands that allow you to back up the extended attributes (EAs).

With the backbyinode command on a DMAPI fi le system, only the data resident in the fi le system at the time the command is issued is backed up. The backbyinode command examines the current state of metadata to do its work. This can be advantageous with DMAPI, because it backs up the state of the managed fi le system. However, any offline data will not be backed up.

To back up all of the data in a DMAPI fi le system, use a command that reads entire fi les, such as the tar command. This can cause a DMAPI-enabled application to restore data for every fi le accessed by the tar command, moving data back and forth between secondary and tertiary storage, so there can be performance implications.

## Formatting diskettes (format or fdformat command)

You can format diskettes in the diskette drive speci fi ed by the Device parameter (the /dev/rfd0 device by default) with the format and fdformat commands.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Formatting a diskette destroys any existing data on that diskette.

The format command determines the device type, which is one of the following:

- 5.25-inch low-density diskette (360 KB) containing 40x2 tracks, each with 9 sectors

- 5.25-inch high-capacity diskette (1.2 MB) containing 80x2 tracks, each with 15 sectors
- 3.5-inch low-density diskette (720 KB) containing 80x2 tracks, each with 9 sectors
- 3.5-inch high-capacity diskette (2.88 MB) containing 80x2 tracks, each with 36 sectors

The sector size is 512 bytes for all diskette types.

Use the format command to format a diskette for high density unless the Device parameter speci fi es a different density.

Use the fdformat command to format a diskette for low density unless the -h flag is speci fi ed. The Device parameter speci fi es the device containing the diskette to be formatted (such as the /dev/rfd0 device for drive 0).

Before formatting a diskette, the format and fdformat commands prompt for veri fi cation. This allows you to end the operation cleanly if necessary.

See the following examples:

- To format a diskette in the /dev/rfd0 device, type the following:
- To format a diskette without checking for bad tracks, type the following:
- To format a 360 KB diskette in a 5.25-inch, 1.2 MB diskette drive in the /dev/rfd1 device, type the following:
- To force high-density formatting of a diskette when using the fdformat command, type the following:

```
format -d /dev/rfd0
```

```
format -f
```

```
format -l -d /dev/rfd1
```

```
fdformat -h
```

## Checking the integrity of a fi le system (fsck command)

Use the fsck command to check and interactively repair inconsistent fi le systems.

It is important to run this command on every fi le system as part of system initialization. You must be able to read the device fi le on which the fi le system resides (for example, the /dev/hd0 device). Normally, the fi le system is consistent, and the fsck command merely reports on the number of fi les, used blocks, and free blocks in the fi le system. If the fi le system is inconsistent, the fsck command displays information about the inconsistencies found and prompts you for permission to repair them. The fsck command is conservative in its repair efforts and tries to avoid actions that might result in the loss of valid data. In certain cases, however, the fsck command recommends the destruction of a damaged fi le.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Always run the fsck command on fi le systems after a system malfunction. Corrective actions can result in some loss of data. The default action for each consistency correction is to wait for the operator to type yes or no . If you do not have write permission for an affected fi le, the fsck command will default to a no response.

See the following examples:

- To check all the default fi le systems, type the following:

fsck

This form of the fsck command asks you for permission before making any changes to a fi le system.

- To fi x minor problems automatically with the default fi le systems, type the following:

```
fsck -p
```

- To check the /dev/hd1 fi le system , type the following:

```
fsck /dev/hd1
```

This checks the unmounted fi le system located on the /dev/hd1 device.

Note: The fsck command does not make corrections to a mounted fi le system.

## Copying to or from diskettes (flcopy command)

Use the flcopy command to copy a diskette (opened as /dev/rfd0 ) to a fi le named floppy created in the current directory.

The message Change floppy, hit return when done displays as needed. The flcopy command then copies the floppy fi le to the diskette.

See the following examples:

- To copy /dev/rfd1 to the floppy fi le in the current directory, type the following:
- To copy the fi rst 100 tracks of the diskette, type the following:

```
flcopy -f /dev/rfd1 -r
```

```
flcopy -f /dev/rfd1 -t 100
```

## Copying fi les to tape or disk (cpio -o command)

Use the cpio -o command to read fi le path names from standard input and copy these fi les to standard output, along with path names and status information.

Path names cannot exceed 128 characters. Avoid giving the cpio command path names made up of many uniquely linked fi les because it might not have enough memory to keep track of the path names and would lose linking information.

See the following examples:

- To copy fi les in the current directory whose names end with .c onto diskette, type the following:

```
ls *.c | cpio -ov >/dev/rfd0
```

The -v flag displays the names of each fi le.

- To copy the current directory and all subdirectories onto diskette, type the following:

```
find . -print | cpio -ov >/dev/rfd0
```

This saves the directory tree that starts with the current directory ( . ) and includes all of its subdirectories and fi les.

- To use a shorter command string, type the following:

```
find . -cpio /dev/rfd0 -print
```

The -print entry displays the name of each fi le as it is copied.

## Copying fi les from tape or disk (cpio -i command)

Use the cpio -i command to read from standard input an archive fi le created by the cpio -o command and copy from it the fi les with names that match the Pattern parameter.

These fi les are copied into the current directory tree. You can list more than one Pattern parameter by using the fi le name notation described in the ksh command. The default for the Pattern parameter is an asterisk ( * ), which selects all fi les in the current directory. In an expression such as [a-z] , the hyphen ( -) means through , according to the current collating sequence.

Note: The patterns "*.c" and "*.o" must be enclosed in quotation marks to prevent the shell from treating the asterisk ( * ) as a pattern-matching character. This is a special case in which the cpio command itself decodes the pattern-matching characters.

See the following examples:

- To list the fi les that have been saved onto a diskette with the cpio command, type the following:

```
cpio -itv </dev/rfd0
```

This displays the table of contents of the data previously saved onto the /dev/rfd0 fi le in the cpio command format. The listing is similar to the long directory listing produced by the ls -l command.

- To list only the fi le path names, use only the -it flags.
- To copy the fi les previously saved with the cpio command from a diskette, type the following:

```
cpio -idmv </dev/rfd0
```

This copies the fi les previously saved onto the /dev/rfd0 fi le by the cpio command back into the fi le system (specify the -i flag). The -d flag allows the cpio command to create the appropriate directories if a directory tree is saved. The -m flag maintains the last modi fi cation time in effect when the fi les are saved. The -v flag causes the cpio command to display the name of each fi le as it is copied.

- To copy selected fi les from diskette, type the following:

```
cpio -i "*.c" "*.o" </dev/rfd0
```

This copies the fi les that end with .c or .o from diskette.

## Copying to or from tapes (tcopy command)

Use the tcopy command to copy magnetic tapes.

For example, to copy from one streaming tape to a 9-track tape, type the following:

```
tcopy /dev/rmt0 /dev/rmt8
```

## Checking the integrity of a tape (tapechk command)

Use the tapechk command to perform rudimentary consistency checking on an attached streaming tape device.

Some hardware malfunctions of a streaming tape drive can be detected by simply reading a tape. The tapechk command provides a way to perform tape reads at the fi le level.

For example, to check the fi rst three fi les on a streaming tape device, type the following:

```
tapechk 3
```

## Archiving fi les (tar command)

The archive backup method is used for a copy of one or more fi les, or an entire database that is saved for future reference, historical purposes, or for recovery if the original data is damaged or lost.

Usually, an archive is used when that speci fi c data is removed from the system.

Use the tar command to write fi les to or retrieve fi les from an archive storage. The tar command looks for archives on the default device (usually tape), unless you specify another device.

When writing to an archive, the tar command uses a temporary fi le (the /tmp/tar* fi le) and maintains in memory a table of fi les with several links. You receive an error message if the tar command cannot create the temporary fi le or if there is not enough memory available to hold the link tables.

See the following examples:

- To write the file1 and file2 fi les to a new archive on the default tape drive, type the following:

```
tar -c file1 file2
```

- To extract all fi les in the /tmp directory from the archive fi le on the /dev/rmt2 tape device and use the time of extraction as the modi fi cation time, type the following:
- To display the names of the fi les in the out.tar disk archive fi le from the current directory, type the following:

```
tar -xm -f/dev/rmt2 /tmp
```

```
tar -vtf out.tar
```

## File backup

Use either the backup command or the smit command to create copies of your fi les on backup media, such as a magnetic tape or diskette.

<!-- image -->

Attention: If you attempt to back up a mounted fi le system, a message displays. The backup command continues, but inconsistencies in the fi le system can occur. This situation does not apply to the root ( / ) fi le system.

The copies you created with the backup command or the smit command are in one of the following backup formats:

- Speci fi c fi les backed up by name, using the -i flag.
- Entire fi le system backed up by i-node number, using the -Level and FileSystem parameters.

## Note:

- The possibility of data corruption always exists when a fi le is modi fi ed during system backup. Therefore, make sure that system activity is at a minimum during the system backup procedure.
- If a backup is made to 8-mm tape with the device block size set to 0 (zero), it is not possible to directly restore data from the tape. If you have done backups with the 0 setting, you can restore data from them by using special procedures described under the restore command.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Be sure the flags you specify match the backup media.

## Backing up fi les using the backup command

Use the backup command to create copies of your fi les on backup media.

For example, to back up selected fi les in your $HOME directory by name, type the following:

```
find $HOME -print | backup -i -v
```

The -i flag prompts the system to read from standard input the names of fi les to be backed up. The find command generates a list of fi les in the user's directory. This list is piped to the backup command as standard input. The -v flag displays a progress report as each fi le is copied. The fi les are backed up on the default backup device for the local system.

See the following examples:

- To back up the root fi le system, type the following:

```
backup -0 -u /
```

The 0 level and the / tell the system to back up the / (root) fi le system. The fi le system is backed up to the /dev/rfd0 fi le. The -u flag tells the system to update the current backup level record in the /etc/dumpdates fi le.

- To back up all fi les in the / (root) fi le system that were modi fi ed since the last 0 level backup, type the following:

```
backup -1 -u /
```

## Backing up fi les using the smit command

Use the smit command to run the backup command, which creates copies of your fi les on backup media.

1. At the prompt, type the following:
2. Type the path name of the directory on which the fi le system is normally mounted in the DIRECTORY full pathname fi eld:

```
smit backup
```

/home/bill

3. In the BACKUP device or FILE fi elds, enter the output device name, as in the following example for a raw magnetic tape device:

/dev/rmt0

4. Use the Tab key to toggle the optional REPORT each phase of the backup fi eld if you want error messages printed to the screen.
5. In a system management environment, use the default for the MAXnumber of blocks to write on backup medium fi eld because this fi eld does not apply to tape backups.
6. Press Enter to back up the named directory or fi le system.
7. Run the restore -t command.

If this command generates an error message, you must repeat the entire backup.

## Shutting down the system

The shutdown command is the safest and most thorough way to halt the operating system.

You might want to shut down your system:

- After installing new software or changing the con fi guration for existing software
- When a hardware problem exists
- When the system is irrevocably hung
- When system performance is degraded
- When the fi le system is possibly corrupt.

When you designate the appropriate flags, this command noti fi es users that the system is about to go down, kills all existing processes, unmounts fi le systems, and halts the system. See shutdown for more information.

Review the following information for details on speci fi c shutdown situations:

## Shutting down the system without rebooting

There are two ways of shutting down the system with no reboot.

You can use two methods to shut down the system without rebooting: the SMIT fastpath, or the shutdown command.

Prerequisites

You must have root user authority to shut down the system.

To shut down the system using SMIT:

1. Log in as root.
2. At the command prompt, type:

```
smit shutdown
```

To shut down the system using the shutdown command:

1. Log in as root.
2. At the command prompt, type:

shutdown

## Shutting down the system to single-user mode

In some cases, you might need to shut down the system and enter single-user mode to perform software maintenance and diagnostics.

1. Type cd / to change to the root directory.

You must be in the root directory to shut down the system to single-user mode to ensure that fi le systems are unmounted cleanly.

2. Type shutdown -m .
2. The system shuts down to single-user mode.

A system prompt displays and you can perform maintenance activities.

## Shutting down the system in an emergency

Use the shutdown command to stop the system quickly without notifying other users.

You can use the shutdown command to shut down the system under emergency conditions.

Type shutdown -F . The -F flag instructs the shutdown command to bypass sending messages to other users and shut down the system as quickly as possible.

## System environment

The system environment is primarily the set of variables that de fi ne or control certain aspects of process execution.

They are set or reset each time a shell is started. From the system-management point of view, it is important to ensure the user is set up with the correct values at log in. Most of these variables are set during system initialization. Their de fi nitions are read from the /etc/profile fi le or set by default.

## Pro fi les

The shell uses two types of pro fi le fi les when you log in to the operating system.

The shell evaluates the commands contained in the fi les and then runs the commands to set up your system environment. The fi les have similar functions except that the /etc/profile fi le controls pro fi le variables for all users on a system whereas the .profile fi le allows you to customize your own environment.

The following pro fi le and system environment information is provided:

- /etc/profile fi le
- .profile fi le
- System environment variable setup
- Changing the Message of the Day
- 'Time data manipulation services' on page 48.

## /etc/pro fi le fi le

The fi rst fi le that the operating system uses at login time is the /etc/profile fi le. This fi le controls system-wide default variables such as:

- Export variables
- File creation mask (umask)
- Terminal types

- Mail messages to indicate when new mail has arrived.

The system administrator con fi gures the profile fi le for all users on the system. Only the system administrator can change this fi le.

## .pro fi le File

The second fi le that the operating system uses at login time is the .profile fi le. The .profile fi le is present in your home ( $HOME ) directory and enables you to customize your individual working environment. The .profile fi le also overrides commands and variables set in the /etc/profile fi le. Because the .profile fi le is hidden, use the ls -a command to list it. Use the .profile fi le to control the following defaults:

- Shells to open
- Prompt appearance
- Environment variables (for example, search path variables)
- Keyboard sound

The following example shows a typical .profile fi le:

```
PATH=/usr/bin:/etc:/home/bin1:/usr/lpp/tps4.0/user:/home/gsc/bin:: epath=/home/gsc/e3: export PATH epath csh
```

This example has de fi ned two paths ( PATH and epath ), exported them, and opened a C shell ( csh ).

You can also use the .profile fi le (or if it is not present, the .profile fi le) to determine login shell variables. You can also customize other shell environments. For example, use the .chsrc and .kshrc fi les to tailor a C shell and a Korn shell, respectively, when each type shell is started.

## Time data manipulation services

The time functions access and reformat the current system date and time.

You do not need to specify any special flag to the compiler to use the time functions. Include the header fi le for these functions in the program. To include a header fi le, use the following statement:

#include &lt;time.h&gt;

The time services are the following:

## Filesets and hardware needed for 64-bit mode

The kernel runs in 64-bit mode, allowing fast access to large amounts of data and ef fi cient handling of 64-bit data types.

The base operating system 64-bit runtime fi leset is bos.64bit . Installing bos.64bit also installs the /etc/methods/cfg64 fi le. The /etc/methods/cfg64 fi le is a command that enables the 64-bit runtime environment. This command is invoked by the rc.boot script during phase 3 of the boot process.

Beginning with AIX 6.1, the 32-bit kernel has been deprecated. Installing the AIX 6.1 base operating system enables the 64-bit mode.

Note: Hardware must be 64-bit capable to run AIX 6.1. The following RS/6000 models use 604e processors and are not 64-bit capable:

- 7025 F50 Series
- 7026 H50 Series
- 9076 H50 Series
- 7043 150 Series
- 7046 B50 Series

To verify the capability of your processor, run the following command:

/usr/sbin/prtconf -c

The prtconf command returns either 32 or 64 , depending on the capability of your processor. If your system does not have the prtconf command, you can use the bootinfo command with the -y flag.

## Hardware required for 64-bit mode

You must have 64-bit hardware to run 64-bit applications.

To determine whether your system has 32-bit or 64-bit hardware architecture:

1. Log in as a root user.
2. At the command line, enter bootinfo -y .

This produces the output of either 32 or 64 , depending on whether the hardware architecture is 32-bit or 64-bit. In addition, if you enter lsattr -El proc0 at any version of AIX, the type of processor for your server displays.

## 32-bit and 64-bit performance comparisons

In most cases, running 32-bit applications on 64-bit hardware is not a problem, because 64-bit hardware can run both 64-bit and 32-bit software. However, 32-bit hardware cannot run 64-bit software.

To fi nd out if any performance issues exist for applications that are running on the system, refer to those application's user guides for their recommended running environment.

## Dynamic Processor Deallocation

AIX can detect and automatically stop using a faulty processor.

Starting with machine type 7044 model 270, the hardware of all systems with two or more processors is able to detect correctable errors, which are gathered by the fi rmware. These errors are not fatal and, as long as they remain rare occurrences, can be safely ignored. However, when a pattern of failures seems to be developing on a speci fi c processor, this pattern might indicate that this component is likely to exhibit a fatal failure in the near future. This prediction is made by the fi rmware based on the failure rates and threshold analysis.

On these systems, AIX implements continuous hardware surveillance and regularly polls the fi rmware for hardware errors. When the number of processor errors hits a threshold and the fi rmware recognizes that

there is a distinct probability that this system component will fail, the fi rmware returns an error report. In all cases, the error is logged in the system error log. In addition, on multiprocessor systems, depending on the type of failure, AIX attempts to stop using the untrustworthy processor and deallocate it. This feature is called Dynamic Processor Deallocation .

At this point, the processor is also flagged by the fi rmware for persistent deallocation for subsequent reboots, until maintenance personnel replaces the processor.

## Processor deallocation impacts to applications

Processor deallocation is transparent for the vast majority of applications, including drivers and kernel extensions. However, you can use the published interfaces to determine whether an application or kernel extension is running on a multiprocessor machine, fi nd out how many processors there are, and bind threads to speci fi c processors.

The bindprocessor interface for binding processes or threads to processors uses bind CPU numbers. The bind CPU numbers are in the range [0.. N -1] where N is the total number of CPUs. To avoid breaking applications or kernel extensions that assume no "holes" in the CPU numbering, AIX always makes it appear for applications as if it is the "last" (highest numbered) bind CPU to be deallocated. For instance, on an 8-way SMP, the bind CPU numbers are [0..7]. If one processor is deallocated, the total number of available CPUs becomes 7, and they are numbered [0..6]. Externally, it looks like CPU 7 has disappeared, regardless of which physical processor failed.

Note: In the rest of this description, the term CPU is used for the logical entity and the term processor for the physical entity.

Potentially, applications or kernel extensions that are binding processes or threads could be broken if AIX silently terminated their bound threads or forcefully moved them to another CPU when one of the processors needs to be deallocated. Dynamic Processor Deallocation provides programming interfaces so that such applications and kernel extensions can be noti fi ed that a processor deallocation is about to happen. When these applications and kernel extensions receive noti fi cation, they are responsible for moving their bound threads and associated resources (such as timer request blocks) away from the last bind CPU ID and for adapting themselves to the new CPU con fi guration.

After noti fi cation, if some threads remain bound to the last bind CPU ID, the deallocation is aborted, the aborted deallocation is logged in the error log, and AIX continues using the ailing processor. When the processor ultimately fails, it causes a total system failure. Therefore, it is important that applications or kernel extensions receive noti fi cation of an impending processor deallocation and act on this notice.

Even in the rare cases that the deallocation cannot go through, Dynamic Processor Deallocation still gives advanced warning to system administrators. By recording the error in the error log, it gives them a chance to schedule a maintenance operation on the system to replace the ailing component before a global system failure occurs.

## Processor deallocation process

AIX can stop a failing processor by deallocating it.

The typical flow of events for processor deallocation is as follows:

1. The fi rmware detects that a recoverable error threshold has been reached by one of the processors.
2. The fi rmware error report is logged in the system error log, and, when AIX is executing on a machine that supports processor deallocation, AIX starts the deallocation process.
3. AIX noti fi es non-kernel processes and threads bound to the last bind CPU.
4. AIX waits up to ten minutes for all the bound threads to move away from the last bind CPU. If threads remain bound, AIX aborts the deallocation.
5. If all processes or threads are unbound from the ailing processor, the previously registered High Availability Event Handlers (HAEHs) are invoked. An HAEH might return an error that aborts the deallocation.
6. Unless aborted, the deallocation process ultimately stops the failing processor.

If there is a failure at any point of the deallocation, the failure and its cause are logged. The system administrator can look at the error log, take corrective action (when possible) and restart the deallocation. For instance, if the deallocation was aborted because an application did not unbind its bound threads, the system administrator can stop the application, restart the deallocation, and then restart the application.

## Enabling Dynamic Processor Deallocation

If your machine supports Dynamic Processor Deallocation, you can use SMIT or system commands to turn the feature on or off .

Dynamic Processor Deallocation is enabled by default during installation, provided the machine has the correct hardware and fi rmware to support it.

## SMIT fastpath procedure

1. With root authority, type smit system at the system prompt, then press Enter.
2. In the Systems Environment window, select Change / Show Characteristics of Operating System .
3. Use the SMIT dialogs to complete the task.

To obtain additional information for completing the task, you can select the F1 Help key in the SMIT dialogs.

## Commands procedure

With root authority, you can use the following commands to work with the Dynamic Processor Deallocation:

- Use the chdev command to change the characteristics of the device speci fi ed.
- If the processor deallocation fails for any reason, you can use the ha\_star command to restart it after it has been fi xed.
- Use the errpt command to generate a report of logged errors.

## Methods of turning processor deallocation on and off

Dynamic Processor Deallocation can be enabled or disabled by changing the value of the cpuguard attribute of the ODM object sys0 .

The possible values for the attribute are enable and disable .

The default is enabled (the attribute cpuguard has a value of enable ). System administrators who want to disable this feature must use either the system menus, the SMIT System Environments menu, or the chdev command. (In previous AIX versions, the default was disabled .)

Note: If processor deallocation is turned off (disabled), the errors are still logged. The error log will contain an error such as CPU\_FAILURE\_PREDICTED , indicating that AIX was noti fi ed of a problem with a CPU.

## Restarting an aborted processor deallocation

Sometimes the processor deallocation fails because an application did not move its bound threads away from the last logical CPU.

Once this problem has been fi xed, either by unbinding (when it is safe to do so) or by stopping the application, the system administrator can restart the processor deallocation process using the ha\_star command.

The syntax for this command is:

```
ha_star -C
```

where -C is for a CPU predictive failure event.

## Processor state considerations

There are several things you should consider about processor states.

Physical processors are represented in the ODM database by objects named proc n where n is a decimal number that represents the physical processor number. Like any other device represented in the ODM database, processor objects have a state, such as De fi ned/Available, and attributes.

The state of a proc object is always Available as long as the corresponding processor is present, regardless of whether it is usable. The state attribute of a proc object indicates if the processor is used and, if not, the reason. This attribute can have three values:

| Item    | Description                                                            |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| enable  | The processor is used.                                                 |
| disable | The processor has been dynamically deallocated.                        |
| faulty  | The processor was declared defective by the fi rmware at startup time. |

If an ailing processor is successfully deallocated, its state goes from enable to disable . Independently of AIX, this processor is also flagged in the fi rmware as defective. Upon reboot, the deallocated processor will not be available and will have its state set to faulty . The ODM proc object, however, is still marked Available. You must physically remove the defective CPU from the system board or remove the CPU board (if possible) for the proc object to change to De fi ned.

In the following example, processor proc4 is working correctly and is being used by the operating system, as shown in the following output:

| # lsattr -EH -l proc4   | # lsattr -EH -l proc4   | # lsattr -EH -l proc4   | # lsattr -EH -l proc4   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| attribute               | value                   | description             | user_settable           |
| state                   | enable                  | Processor state         | False                   |
| type #                  | PowerPC_RS64-III        | Processor type          | False                   |

When processor proc4 gets a predictive failure, it gets deallocated by the operating system, as shown in the following:

| # lsattr -EH -l proc4   | # lsattr -EH -l proc4   | # lsattr -EH -l proc4   | # lsattr -EH -l proc4   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| attribute               | value                   | description             | user_settable           |
| state                   | disable                 | Processor state         | False                   |
| type #                  | PowerPC_RS64-III        | Processor type          | False                   |

At the next system restart, processor proc4 is reported by fi rmware as defective, as shown in the following:

| # lsattr -EH -l proc4 attribute   | value            | description     | user_settable   |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| state                             | faulty           | Processor state | False           |
| type #                            | PowerPC_RS64-III | Processor type  | False           |

But the status of processor proc4 remains Available, as shown in the following:

| # lsdev name   | -CH -l proc4 status   | location   | description   |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------|
| proc4 #        | Available             | 00-04      | Processor     |

## Deallocation error log entries

Three different error log messages are associated with CPU deallocation.

The following are examples.

## errpt short format - summary

The following is an example of entries displayed by the errpt command (without options):

| # errpt IDENTIFIER   |   TIMESTAMP | T   | C   | RESOURCE_NAME   | DESCRIPTION              |
|----------------------|-------------|-----|-----|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 804E987A             |  1008161399 | I   | O   | proc4           | CPU DEALLOCATED          |
| 8470267F             |  1008161299 | T   | S   | proc4           | CPU DEALLOCATION ABORTED |
| 1B963892 #           |  1008160299 | P   | H   | proc4           | CPU FAILURE PREDICTED    |

- If processor deallocation is enabled, a CPU FAILURE PREDICTED message is always followed by either a CPU DEALLOCATED message or a CPU DEALLOCATION ABORTED message.
- If processor deallocation is not enabled, only the CPU FAILURE PREDICTED message is logged. Enabling processor deallocation any time after one or more CPU FAILURE PREDICTED messages have been logged initiates the deallocation process and results in a success or failure error log entry, as described above, for each processor reported failing.

## errpt long format - detailed description

The following is the form of output obtained with errpt -a :

- CPU\_FAIL\_PREDICTED

## System environment variable setup

The system environment is primarily the set of variables that de fi ne or control certain aspects of process execution.

They are set or reset each time a shell is started. From the system-management point of view, it is important to ensure the user is set up with the correct values at login. Most of these variables are set during system initialization. Their de fi nitions are read from the /etc/profile fi le or set by default.

## Testing the system battery

If your system is losing track of time, the cause might be a depleted or disconnected battery.

1. To determine the status of your system battery, type the following diag command:
2. When the Diagnostics main menu appears, select the Problem Determination option.

```
diag -B -c
```

If the battery is disconnected or depleted, a problem menu will be displayed with a service request number (SRN). Record the SRN on Item 4 of the Problem Summary Form and report the problem to your hardware service organization.

If your system battery is operational, your system time might have been reset incorrectly because either the date or setclock command was run incorrectly or unsuccessfully.

HH Speci fi es the hour in the day (using a 24-hour clock).

MM Speci fi es the minute number.

YY Speci fi es the fi rst two digits of a four-digit year.

- yy Speci fi es the last two numbers of the year.

With root authority, you can use the date command to set the current date and time. For example:

date 021714252002

Sets the date to Feb. 17, 2002, and time to 14:25.

setclock command

The setclock command displays or sets the time and date by requesting the current time from a time server on a network.

To display your system's date and time, enter:

/usr/sbin/setclock

The setclock command takes the fi rst response from the time server, converts the calendar clock reading found there, and shows the local date and time. If no time server responds, or if the network is not operational, the setclock command displays a message to that effect and leaves the date and time settings unchanged.

Note: Any host running the inetd daemon can act as a time server.

With root authority, you can use the setclock command to send an Internet TIME service request to a time server host and sets the local date and time accordingly. For example:

setclock TimeHost

Where TimeHost is the host name or IP address of the time server.

## Olson time zone support and setup

Beginning with AIX 6.1, support for time zone values consistent with the Olson database are provided.

The POSIX time zone speci fi cation supported in previous AIX releases, does not adequately handle changes to time zone rules such as daylight saving time. The Olson database maintains a historical record of time zone rules, so that if the rules change in a speci fi c location, AIX interprets dates and time correctly both in the present and in the past.

Time zone de fi nitions conforming to the POSIX speci fi cation are still supported and recognized by AIX. AIX checks the TZ environment variable to determine if the environment variable matches an Olson time zone value. If the TZ environment variable does not match an Olson time zone value, AIX then follows the POSIX speci fi cation rules.

For more details about the TZ environment variable, refer to Environment fi le .

To set the time zone using Olson de fi ned values, use the following SMIT path: System Environments &gt; Change / Show Date, Time and Time Zone &gt; Change Time Zone Using System De fi ned Values .

## Message of the day setup

The message of the day is displayed every time a user logs in to the system.

It is a convenient way to communicate information to all users, such as installed software version numbers or current system news. To change the message of the day, use your favorite editor to edit the /etc/motd fi le.

## AIX usage metric data (SLM tags) for IBM License Metric Tool

The Software License Metric (SLM) tags generated by the AIX operating system serve as a usage metric data that is used by the IBM Â® License Metric Tool. The usage metric data records the virtual CPU (vCPU) information that represents the number of virtual CPUs that are online in the system.

To use the IBM License Metric Tool, you must install the slm.rte fi leset that is available in the AIX operating system expansion pack and the fi leset can also be downloaded from the website.

The IBM License Metric Tool generates a vcpu.slmtag Software License Metric Tag (SLMTAG) fi le that expands dynamically. The vcpu.slmtag fi le is located in the /var/opt/slm directory. This fi le is used by the BigFix Agent (BESClient) to incorporate the IBM License Metric Tool Agent software and to send the fi le to the IBM License Metric Tool server.

The IBM License Metric Tool can be used with the BigFix Agent (BESClient) that is installed and con fi gured in the system. The BigFix Agent must be separately obtained from IBM License Metric Tool server and installed in the client. If the BigFix agent is not installed in the system, the SLMTAG fi le is created, but data is not sent to the IBM License Metric Tool server.

You can con fi gure the IBM License Metric Tool with the environment variables that are de fi ned in the /etc/environment fi le. At the time of installation, these variables are set to default values. The following con fi gurable variables can be con fi gured.

| Variable              | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SLM_VCPU_PERIOD_HOURS | Time period that is speci fi ed in hours, for adding a new metric entry. The default value is 720 hours (30 days). This value must be a multiple of 4. If you specify a value that is not a multiple of 4, the next multiple of 4 is considered by the IBM License Metric Tool. The minimum value is 4 hours. |
| SLM_VCPU_MAX_FSIZE    | Maximum fi le size that is speci fi ed in bytes is the maximum size (in bytes) for the record fi le. If the fi le size exceeds this limit, the fi le is archived. The default value is 2097152 bytes (2 MB). The minimum value is 10 KB. If you specify a lower                                               |

| Variable            | Details                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     | value, the IBM License Metric Tool considers it as 10 KB.                                                                                                             |
| SLM_VCPU_COUNT_ARCH | Number of archives retained by the tool. The default value is 4. The minimum value is 1. If you specify a lower value, the IBM License Metric Tool considers it as 1. |

The usage metric data is displayed in the Resource Utilization page of the IBM License Metric Tool Server GUI. The usage metric data is displayed next to the host name as the VCPU metric type and the COUNT subtype.

## AIX Runtime Expert

AIX Runtime Expert provides a simpli fi ed set of actions that can be used against a single consolidation for collecting, applying, and verifying the runtime environment for one or more AIX instances.

There are tools provided by AIX components, such as Reliability Availability Serviceability (RAS), Security, or Kernel, which allow you to change settings within each component layer in order to tune the operating system to a particular need or requirement. AIX Runtime Expert enables system-wide con fi guration by using an extendable framework to handle the many different con fi guration methods that currently exist in AIX.

AIX Runtime Expert executes multiple-component con fi guration commands as a single action using a con fi guration pro fi le. You can use this pro fi le to apply identical system settings across multiple systems. AIX Runtime Expert provides a simpli fi ed alternative for managing the runtime con fi guration of one or more systems, but it does not prevent the use of other methods to change system settings.

## AIX Runtime Expert concepts

You must have basic knowledge of AIX Runtime Expert before you start using it.

AIX Runtime Expert base capabilities support con fi guration pro fi le management and application for a single AIX system. To enable multiple system scalable consumption for a single pro fi le, an LDAP based pro fi le description can be discovered and consumed by AIX systems as they start or as the system is directed by administrative operations at the target AIX endpoints. Remote management for AIX Runtime Expert can only be done with the Network Install Manager (NIM) component. Using existing NIM functions, you can run AIX Runtime Expert remotely on several stand-alone NIM clients from a NIM master machine.

## AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les are used to set values on a running system, extract values for a running system, and compare values against a running system or against another pro fi le.

A pro fi le describes one or more runtime con fi guration controls and their settings for the targeted functional area. A pro fi le can represent a full set of controls or a subset of controls and their values. Con fi guration pro fi les are standard XML fi les. Using AIX Runtime Expert you can manage pro fi les and apply them on the de fi ned system.

A pro fi le can contain con fi guration parameters and tuning parameters without any values, like sample pro fi les. The purpose of a pro fi le without any parameters is to extract the current systems values from the speci fi ed pro fi le. Pro fi les containing at least one parameter without any values have the following limitations:

- Using the artexset command fails with an error.
- Using the artexdiff command returns a warning message for each parameter that has no value.

The value of a parameter in a pro fi le can contain the following:

- No value
- A blob value, which is a base64 encoded binary data as an in-line text fi le. The blob value is used to replace existing fi les, like /etc/motd or /etc/hosts .
- A non-blob value, which is a value assigned to system con fi guration parameters, like an integer or string.

In the /etc/security/artex/samples directory you can view existing sample pro fi les. The sample pro fi les only contain parameter names that are supported by the default settings installed with AIX Runtime Expert. The parameters in the sample pro fi les do not have any values. Sample pro fi les are read only fi les. Use the sample pro fi les as a template to create new con fi guration pro fi les. You cannot apply existing samples to a running system.

The following examples are some of the base con fi guration commands that can be controlled through con fi guration pro fi les:

- Network con fi guration
- no
- mktcpip
- Kernel con fi guration
- ioo
- schedo
- RAS con fi guration
- alog
- Security con fi guration
- setsecattr

## Example

The following example displays a con fi guration pro fi le for different catalogs and sub-catalogs with assigned values for different parameters. You could edit this pro fi le with any XML editor or use the vi command and change the existing values for the de fi ned parameters.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <Profile origin="get" version="1.0" date="2009-04-25T15:33:37Z"> <Catalog id="vmoParam"> <Parameter name="kernel_heap_psize" value="0" applyType="nextboot" reboot="true" <Parameter name="maxfree" value="1088" /> </Catalog> <Catalog id="noParam"> <SubCat id="tcp_network"> <Parameter name="tcp_recvspace" value="16384" /> <Parameter name="tcp_sendspace" value="16384" /> </SubCat> <SubCat id="general_network"> <Parameter name="use_sndbufpool" value="1" applyType="nextboot" reboot="true" /> </SubCat> </Catalog> <Catalog id="lvmoParam"> <Parameter name="max_vg_pbuf_count" value="0"> <Target class="vg" instance="rootvg" /> </Parameter> <Parameter name="pv_pbuf_count" value="512"> <Target class="vg" instance="rootvg" /> </Parameter> </Catalog>
```

```

Modifying AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les are XML fi les and can be modi fi ed with any XML editor or any text editor.

Creating AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

Use existing samples in the /etc/security/artex/samples directory to create a new pro fi le with the artexget command. The sample pro fi les are a template for you to create a pro fi le that you can modify and save into a custom fi le.

## Getting AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le values

Use the artexget command to fi nd information about a pro fi le.

## Applying AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

To set a system with the con fi guration and tunable parameters from a pro fi le, apply a pro fi le using the artexset command.

## AIX Runtime Expert catalogs

Catalogs are the mechanism that de fi nes and speci fi es con fi guration controls that can be operated on by AIX Runtime Expert.

Catalogs are provided for the controls that are currently supported by the AIX Runtime Expert. Catalogs are de fi nition fi les that map con fi guration pro fi le values to parameters that run commands and con fi guration actions.

AIX Runtime Expert provides you with existing read-only catalogs, located in the /etc/security/ artex/catalogs directory, that identify values that can be modi fi ed. Do not modify these catalogs.

Each catalog contains parameters for one component. However, some catalogs can contain parameters from more than one closely related components. The names of the catalogs describe the components that are contained in the catalog. The &lt;description&gt; XML element in each catalog provides a description of the catalog.

## AIX Runtime Expert and LDAP

AIX Runtime Expert can retrieve pro fi les from the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server.

The AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les must be stored as ibm-artexPro fi le objects and have the following mandatory attributes:

- Ibm-artexPro fi leName. The AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le name.
- Ibm-artexPro fi leXMLData. The XML content of the AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le that is stored as an octetString.

The AIX Runtime Expert schema must be installed on the LDAP server before storing any AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les. Setting up an LDAP server for AIX Runtime Expert is similar to setting up an LDAP server for user authentication. For more information about setting up LDAP, see Setting up an ITDS security information server.

Setting up an LDAP client for AIX Runtime Expert is similar to setting up an LDAP client for user authentication. For more information, view the Setting up an LDAP client topic. To set up an LDAP client, use the mksecldap -c command to correctly con fi gure the secldapclntd daemon. AIX Runtime Expert relies on the secldapclntd daemon to access the LDAP server. By default, AIX Runtime Expert looks for pro fi le entries under the identi fi er DN: ou=artex,cn=AIXDATA . You can customize this DN by updating the artexbasedn key in the /etc/security/ldap/ldap.cfg secldapclntd con fi guration fi le.

## Uploading an AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le

To upload an AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le, you can either create an LDAP data interchange formatted (LDIF) fi le and use the ldapadd command or use an LDAP administration tool such as Tivoli Â® Directory Server Web Administration Tool.

The following is an example of a pro fi le that is saved in LDIF:

```
dn: ou=artex,cn=AIXDATA
```

```
objectClass: organizationalUnit objectClass: top ou: artex dn: ibm-artexProfileName=alogProfile.xml,ou=artex,cn=AIXDATA objectClass: ibm-artexProfile objectClass: top
```

```
ibm-artexProfileName: alogProfile.xml ibm-artexProfileXMLData:< file:///etc/security/artex/samples/alogProfile.xml
```

The following is an example of uploading a pro fi le using the ldapadd command and a sample LDIF fi le named sample.ldif:

```
ldapadd -c -h <ldaphost> -D cn=admin -w <password> -f sample.ldif
```

## AIX Runtime Expert and RBAC

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) can be used to give non root users the ability to execute the AIX Runtime Expert commands.

## AIX Runtime Expert authorizations

On installing the artex.base.rte fi leset three system authorizations get created that allow different levels of access to the AIX Runtime Expert functionality:

- The aix.system.con fi g.artex.read authorization allows the execution of the artexlist and artexmerge commands. The artexget and artexdiff commands are also allowed, but only to obtain the pro fi le values. The values cannot be captured from the system (that is the artexget command cannot be run with the -r , -n or -p flags, and artexdiff command can only be run between two pro fi les).
- The aix.system.con fi g.artex.get authorization allows all operations allowed by the artex.system.con fi g.read authorization, and additionally allows the unrestricted execution of the artexget and artexdiff command.
- The aix.system.con fi g.artex.set authorization allows all operations allowed by the artex.system.con fi g.get authorization and additionally allows the execution of the artexset command.

## AIX Runtime Expert roles

AIX Runtime Expert does not create any new role however the artex.base.rte fi lesets add the aix.system.con fi g.artex authorization to the SysCon fi g role. Any user with SysCon fi g role or any enclosing role (such as the isso role) will be able to run the artexlist , artexmerge , artexdiff , artexget and artexset commands.

## Restrictions

For security reasons, the use of the ARTEX\_CATALOG\_PATH environment variable is restricted to the root user. Non root users who are granted the right to execute the AIX Runtime Expert commands through the RBAC cannot use the ARTEX\_CATALOG\_PATH environment variable.

## Administering AIX Runtime Expert

AIX Runtime Expert uses a few simple commands to create pro fi les, modify pro fi les, combine pro fi les, and apply pro fi les.

## Con fi guring AIX Runtime Expert

AIX Runtime Expert uses the con fi guration fi le /etc/security/artex/config/artex.conf .

An entry in the con fi guration fi le consists of the name of a con fi guration option, followed by one or more spaces and a value. Blank lines and lines starting with a # sign are ignored.

The following options are supported:

| Table 1. Con fi guration Options   | Table 1. Con fi guration Options                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| ARTEX_CATALOG_PATH                 | Colon-separated list of directories searched for catalog fi les. This option is overridden by the ARTEX_CATALOG_PATH environment variable. Default path is /etc/security/artex/ catalogs .                                                          |
| ARTEX_PROFILE_PATH                 | Colon-separated list of directories searched for pro fi le fi les by the artexlist command if no directory is speci fi ed. This option is overridden by the ARTEX_PROFILE_PATH environment variable. Default path is /etc/security/artex/ samples . |
| DEBUG_LOG_CATEGORY                 | Debug category for the log fi le. This option can be repeated to select multiple debug categories.                                                                                                                                                  |
| DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL                    | Debug level for the log fi le between 0 (no debug traces) and 3 (most verbose).                                                                                                                                                                     |
| MAX_CMDS                           | Maximum number of external commands executed concurrently. External commands executed by AIX Runtime Expert are queued so that no more than MAX_CMDS external commands are executed simultaneously at any given time. Default is 10.                |

## Creating AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

Use existing samples in the /etc/security/artex/samples directory to create a new pro fi le with the artexget command. The sample pro fi les are a template for you to create a pro fi le that you can modify and save into a custom fi le.

To create a pro fi le with all of the parameters supported by AIX Runtime Expert, complete the following steps:

1. Con fi gure and tune your system to have the desired settings for a new pro fi le.
2. Go to the samples directory: /etc/security/artex/samples
3. Run the following command to create a new pro fi le named custom\_all.xml :

```
artexget -p all.xml > /directory_for_new_profile/custom_all.xml
```

Note: The custom\_all.xml pro fi le can be used to con fi gure other systems that have a similar current system con fi guration.

To create a pro fi le for a speci fi c component, such as network options, complete the following steps:

1. Con fi gure and tune your system to have the desired settings for a new pro fi le.
2. Go to the samples directory: /etc/security/artex/samples .

3. Create a new pro fi le named custom\_no.xml from the existing sample pro fi le, noProfile.xml , by running the following command:

```
artexget -p noProfile.xml > /directory_for_new_profile/custom_no.xml
```

The newly created pro fi les can be customized by changing or removing the values of the parameters using an XML editor or any text editor.

The custom pro fi les can be uploaded to LDAP server to use from multiple AIX systems. To upload the pro fi les to LDAP server, use the tools provided by LDAP.

## Modifying AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les are XML fi les and can be modi fi ed with any XML editor or any text editor.

User-created pro fi les using artexget command can be customized by changing the values of the parameters or by removing some of the parameters that are not required to modify or monitor the pro fi le.

To modify AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les, complete the following steps:

1. From the directory where custom\_all.xml is located, run the following commands to save a copy of the pro fi le:
2. From the directory where custom\_all.xml is located, run the following command to edit the pro fi le:

```
cp custom_all.xml custom_all_backup.xml
```

```
vi custom_all.xml
```

Note: You can use any XML editor or text editor.

3. Modify the values of the parameters or remove the parameters that are not required to change or monitor the pro fi le.
4. Run the following command to verify that the pro fi le changes have been saved correctly by comparing them against the current system settings:

```
artexdiff -c -r custom_all.xml custom_all_backup.xml
```

The artexdiff command displays the parameters that were modi fi ed by the editor. The &lt;FirstValue&gt; displays the value of the pro fi le, and the &lt;SecondValue&gt; displays the value of the current system.

## Combining AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

A pro fi le can represent a full set of controls or any subset of controls. Another useful way to modify pro fi les is to combine pro fi les that represent a subset of controls using the artxmerge command.

You can use the artexmerge command to combine one or more pro fi les into a single pro fi le.

To combine pro fi les complete, the following steps:

1. From the directory where the pro fi les are stored run the following command:

artexmerge profile\_name1.xml profile\_name2.xml &gt; new\_profile\_name.xml

2. Run the following command to view the pro fi le and verify that it is a valid pro fi le:

```
artexget new_profile_name.xml
```

Note: If the pro fi les you are combining have duplicate parameters, the process of combining the pro fi les will fail. Alternatively, if you use the -f flag, then the parameter values from the latest pro fi le are used.

## Finding AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

Use the artexlist command to fi nd pro fi les in a given path and from an LDAP server.

To fi nd pro fi les, complete the following steps:

1. If the pro fi le is on the local system, run the following command:

artexlist

2. If the pro fi le is located on an LDAP server, run the following command:

artexlist -l

By default, the command lists the pro fi les in the /etc/security/artex/samples directory. To override the default path with an environment variable, set the ARTEX\_PROFILE\_PATH to one or more semicolon delimited paths, or a path that can be passed as an argument.

## Related information

artexlist command

## Getting AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le values

Use the artexget command to fi nd information about a pro fi le.

Using a pro fi le, you can display the values from the pro fi le or from the system in different formats (XML, CSV, or text) with different fi lters, such as parameters that need a reboot to take effect and parameters that need some services to be stopped and restarted.

Getting values from the system is useful in the following situations:

## To take a snapshot of a system

When a system is con fi gured correctly, you can save the con fi guration of the system by taking a snapshot. You can use this snapshot at a later date, if any of the parameters are changed and you do not remember which parameters were changed. The snapshot pro fi le can be used to bring the system back to the desired con fi guration.

## To clone the con fi guration of a system for use on other systems

After a system is con fi gured and tuned in an environment, you can extract the system settings into an AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le and apply the pro fi le on other systems.

## To debug a problem

When a problem is found on a production system, you can use a pro fi le to set up the same system settings on a test system and than debug the problems on the test system.

To get information about a pro fi le, complete the following steps:

1. Go to the directory where the pro fi le you want to get information about is located.
2. To get information about the pro fi le run the following command:

```
artexget name_of_profile.xml
```

Limitation: When a system has many users de fi ned, the AIX Runtime Expert commands artexget , artexset , and artexdiff applied to pro fi les such as, chuserPro fi le.xml, corePro fi le.xml, or all.xml pro fi les, requires more time to complete than usual.

## Applying AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

To set a system with the con fi guration and tunable parameters from a pro fi le, apply a pro fi le using the artexset command.

To apply a user-created pro fi le, complete the following steps:

1. Go to the directory where the pro fi le you want to apply is stored.
2. To apply the pro fi le to the system, run the following command:
3. Optional: If you want to apply a pro fi le every time the system restarts to maintain a consistent con fi guration, run the following command:

```
artexset -c name_of_profile.xml
```

```
artexset -b name_of_profile.xml
```

Note: The restricted parameters are supported as read-only parameters. Therefore, the values of these parameters can be retrieved with the artexget command, but cannot be set with the artexset command.

## Rolling back AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

Use the artexset -u command to reset the con fi guration settings to the previous con fi guration setting of a system. You can apply the system settings that were being used before the pro fi le was applied.

You cannot use the rollback command if you have not changed the system settings during your current session.

Rolling back is not considered a re-imaging of an operating system. When you use the rollback command, you are not deleting or creating resources, you are not deleting or creating resources but instead reverting the runtime con fi guration values to the system's previous settings. With the rollback command you cannot roll back to settings from a particular time or date. You can only roll back to the systems previous settings before you made a change.

The rollback command can be used in the following cases:

- Testing con fi guration changes to a system. If the new con fi guration works poorly, you can quickly revert to a previously trusted con fi guration.
- Debugging a system. If a system starts running poorly, a roll back could con fi rm if con fi guration changes have played a part in a newly detected problem.
- Implementing a new pro fi le in order to satisfy some special exception situation. For example, a speci fi ed action only occurs once a month on the system, and after it has been applied to your system you want to restore the system to its previous con fi guration.

To roll back to the previous system settings, complete the following steps:

1. To roll back a pro fi le, run the following command:
2. To verify that the roll back completed correctly, run the following command to compare system settings:

```
artexset -u
```

```
artexdiff -f txt -r -profile_name.xml
```

Note: The pro fi le\_name.xml is the name of the latest applied pro fi le to the system.

The differences between the system and the pro fi le are displayed.

## Comparing AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

Use the artexdiff command to compare two pro fi les or a pro fi le values with system values.

To compare the pro fi les for two different systems complete the following steps:

1. Run the following command from system 1:

```
artexget -p all.xml > all_system1.xml 2. Run the following command from system 2: artexget -p all.xml > all_system2.xml
```

To verify any con fi guration parameters are changed on a system after a period of time, for example, if you go on vacation and want to verify any changes while you were gone, run the following commands:.

- After you return from vacation, run the following command:

```
$ artexget -p all.xml > all_before_vacation.xml Â· To view any con fi guration changes that occurred during your vacation, run the following command:
```

```
$ artexdiff -c -p all_before_vacation.xml
```

## Writing AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les

You can expand the scope of AIX Runtime Expert by adding catalogs and pro fi les that the program can use. You must be familiar with AIX Runtime Expert concepts before attempting to write new catalogs.

The smallest piece of information handled by AIX Runtime Expert is a parameter. Parameters can be tunable, con fi guration fi les, environment variables, properties of objects such as users, devices or subsystems (such objects are called targets in the AIX Runtime Expert context).

Parameters are aggregated into pro fi les according to the domain of activity (such as user, tcpi). Pro fi les are the intended means of interaction between the users and the AIX Runtime Expert framework. Pro fi les are input to the artexget command that retrieve the parameter value on the system and return a pro fi le. Pro fi les (including values) are input to the artexset command that set the parameters to the value read into the pro fi le.

## Concepts in writing AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le

AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les are XML fi les that contain a list of con fi guration parameters and optionally the parameter values and the usage flags.

Pro fi les can be located on the system being tuned when using the AIX Runtime Expert commands directly on the command line.

## Pro fi le locations

AIX Runtime Expert sample pro fi les are located in the directory /etc/security/artex/samples .

When you are writing a new catalog for the AIX Runtime Expert to support, it is recommended that you also write a sample pro fi le that can be used as an entry for the artexget command. A sample pro fi le is a read-only pro fi le with no values assigned to the parameters. Existing sample pro fi les are located in the /etc/security/artex/samples directory. By default, the artexlist command lists only the pro fi les located in the default directory, but the default directory can be modi fi ed by setting the ARTEX\_PROFILE\_PATH environment variable. Multiple directories can be speci fi ed in this environment variable by using the : separator.

All pro fi les from the samples directory are merged during the installation of the artex.base.samples fi leset, to form the default.xml pro fi le that is used by the snap command. A pro fi le that should not be part of the default.xml pro fi le should not be delivered in the samples directory. Example of pro fi les that should not be included in the default.xml pro fi le are the pro fi les that have the potential to include thousands of parameters (for example if it uses users as a target class) and pro fi les that should be run only on speci fi c systems (for instance the vios attributes pro fi le).

## Pro fi le naming

AIX Runtime Expert pro fi les are named based on the commands.

Pro fi les are usually built around a single command or a set of commands. Pro fi les may include several catalogs if the catalogs are closely related. The convention is to name the fi les based on a command say, commandPro fi le.xml for the sample pro fi le and commandParam.xml for the catalog, but this is not mandatory. Only the .xml fi le extension is required.

## Pro fi le process

Discusses the process to write a new AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le.

The following steps are required to be performed when writing a new AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le:

1. Make a list of the parameters you want in the pro fi le.
2. Create an &lt;Parameter name='...'&gt; element for each of the parameters, setting the name attribute to the name used in the catalog fi le &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element.
3. Group all parameters de fi ned in a same catalog fi le inside the same &lt;Catalog id='...'&gt; element, setting the id attribute to the same id used in the catalog fi le &lt;Catalog&gt; element.
4. For each &lt;Parameter&gt; element, do the following:
- a. If the parameter is de fi ned with the reboot = true in the catalog fi le, add the reboot = true and applyType = nextboot attributes.
- b. If the parameter must be only captured and not set, add the readOnly = true attribute.
- c. If the parameter is de fi ned with a non-empty targetClass attribute in the catalog fi le, do the following:
- i) If target discovery is desired for this parameter, then de fi ne a single &lt;Parameter&gt; element for this parameter and use the special &lt;Target class='' instance='' &gt; target for this element.
9. ii) If speci fi c targets need to be de fi ned for this parameter, then de fi ne one &lt;Parameter&gt; element for each target. Under each &lt;Parameter&gt; element, de fi ne the appropriate &lt;Target class='...' instance='...' /&gt; elements to specify the target completely.
5. Test the pro fi le by running the artexget -r command.

## AIX Runtime Expert pro fi le elements

## &lt;Pro fi le&gt; element

The &lt;Pro fi le&gt; element is the root element for all pro fi le fi les.

## Syntax

The following attributes are supported:

## Table 2. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type     | Description                                                                               |
|-------------|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| origin      | no         | string   | Origin of the pro fi le.                                                                  |
| date        | no         | dateTime | Date of creation or last modi fi cation of the pro fi le. Format is YYYY- MM-DDThh:mm:ss. |
| readOnly    | no         | boolean  | Tells whether this pro fi le can be used in a set operation. Default value is false .     |
| version     | no         | string   | Version number of the pro fi le.                                                          |

The following child elements are supported:

Table 3. Child Elements

| Child element   | Required   | Number Description                               |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| no              | 0 - 1      | <ShortDescription> Short textual of the catalog. |
| no              | 0 - 1      | <Description> Long textual of the catalog.       |
| no              | 0 - 1      | <Comments> User-provided comments.               |
| no              | 0 - any    | <Catalog> Catalog required handle the operations |

## Attributes

The origin attribute

The origin attribute is an informational attribute that can be assigned the following values:

- When creating a sample pro fi le, the origin attribute must be set to reference .
- When a pro fi le is created by using the artexget command, the origin attribute is automatically set to get .

## Child elements

The &lt;Comments&gt; element is an optional string reserved for other purposes. This element must not be used when a pro fi le is created manually, and it not used by the base AIX Runtime Expert commands.

## Examples

1. An empty sample pro fi le would look like this:
2. The artexget -r /etc/security/artex/samples/smtctmProfile.xml command outputs a pro fi le similar to following example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Profile origin="reference" version="2.0.0" readOnly="true"> </Profile>
```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Profile origin="get" version="2.0.1" date="2010-09-29T07:50:56Z"> <Catalog id="smtctlParam" version="2.0"> <Parameter name="enableSMT" value="1"/> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

The &lt;Description&gt; and &lt;ShortDescription&gt; element.

&lt;Description&gt; and &lt;ShortDescription&gt; elements

The &lt;Description&gt; and the &lt;ShortDescription&gt; elements can be used to provide a textual description for pro fi les and parameters.

## Syntax

The parent element of the &lt;ShortDescription&gt; element is:

- &lt;Pro fi le&gt; element

The parent element of the &lt;Description&gt; element can be:

- &lt;Pro fi le&gt; element
- &lt;Parameter&gt; element

Both the &lt;Description&gt; and &lt;ShortDescription&gt; elements have the same format. The text contained by the &lt;Description&gt; element is the string content of the XML tag.

## Usage

Descriptions in pro fi le fi les are not currently used by the AIX Runtime Expert framework. AIX Runtime Expert commands ignore any comments included in the input pro fi le.

## Examples

Following is an example of the &lt;Description&gt; and &lt;ShortDescription&gt; elements:

&lt;ShortDescription&gt; Short summary of field contents. &lt;/ShortDescription&gt; &lt;Description&gt; This text field can be used to display in full detail the use of the parent element. &lt;/Description&gt;

## Related information

The &lt;Pro fi le&gt; element.

The &lt;Parameter&gt; element.

&lt;Catalog&gt; element

The &lt;Catalog&gt; element indicates the name of the catalog fi le that contains the de fi nitions for the child &lt;Parameter&gt; elements.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Pro fi le&gt;

The following attributes are supported:

## Table 4. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                                                           |
|-------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id          | yes        | string | Speci fi es the catalog id. This name should be unique on the system. |
| version     | no         | string | Speci fi es the version of the catalog used to build this pro fi le.  |

The following child elements are supported:

Table 5. Child elements

| Child element   | Required   | Number                               | Description   |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| no              | 0 - any    | Parameter included in the catalog.   | <Parameter>   |
| no              | 0 - any    | Subcategory included in the catalog. | <SubCat>      |
| no              | 0 - any    | Seed included in the catalog.        | <Seed>        |

## Attributes

## id attribute

The id attribute must be set to the name of the catalog that de fi nes the parameters listed under the &lt;Catalog&gt; element. The id attribute is the base name of the catalog fi le on the disk, with the .xml extension removed. For example, a pro fi le will use the &lt;Catalog id='commandParam'&gt; element to reference the commandParam.xml catalog fi le.

By default, the catalog fi les are searched under the /etc/security/artex/catalogs directory. However it is possible, for the root user only, to search other directories by setting the ARTEX\_CATALOG\_PATH environment variable. Multiple directories can be speci fi ed in this environment variable using the : separator.

## version attribute

The version attribute is written as MM.mm where MM is the major number and mm is the minor number.

The version attribute must match the version of the referenced catalog fi le (see The &lt;Catalog&gt; element in the section Writing AIX Runtime Expert catalogs). If an AIX Runtime Expert command is run on a pro fi le that references a catalog with the incorrect version, the following warning message is displayed:

```
0590-218 Catalog version differs from the one referenced in profile Local catalog version is '2.1'. Version used to build profile was '2.0'
```

## Usage

The &lt;Catalog&gt; element identi fi es the catalog fi le that contains the de fi nition of the listed seeds and parameters. All seeds and parameter elements in a pro fi le must be located in the appropriate &lt;Catalog&gt; element.

A pro fi le may reference several catalogs. For example, the default.xml pro fi le is built during the installation of the artex.base.sample fi leset by merging a select set of other sample pro fi les.

## Examples

The security attributes pro fi le secattrProfile.xml uses three catalogs, each catalog handling, one of the security tables:

```
<Profile origin="reference" readOnly="true" version="2.0.0">
```

```
<Catalog id="privcmdParam" version="2.0" <Parameter name="privatecommands" /> </Catalog> <Catalog id="privdevParam" version="2.0"> <Parameter name="privatedevices"/> </Catalog> <Catalog id="privfileParam" version="2.0"> <Parameter name="privatefiles" /> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

The following attributes are supported:

## Table 6. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id          | yes        | string | Speci fi es the subcategory name. This name should be unique within a same <Catalog> element. |

The following child elements are supported

Table 7. Child Elements

| Child element   | Number   | Required Description                   |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| no              | 0 - any  | <Parameter> Contains a parameter name. |
| no              | 0 - any  | <SubCat> Nested subcategory            |

## Attributes

The id attribute uniquely identi fi es a subcategory within a catalog. A pro fi le may include several subcategories with the same id, provided that these are not used under the same &lt;Catalog&gt; element.

## Child elements

A &lt;SubCat&gt; element may have another &lt;SubCat&gt; as a child element. There is no limit to the number of nested subcategories you can de fi ne.

## Usage

Subcategories are only included for readability. They do not affect the way parameters are handled.

## Examples

The noProfile.xml pro fi le includes several subcategories. Following is an example:

```
<Profile origin="reference" readOnly="true" version="2.0.0"> <Catalog id="noParam" version="2.0"> <SubCat id="general_network" <Parameter name="fasttimo"/> <Parameter name="nbc_limit"/> </SubCat> <SubCat id="tcp_network"> <Parameter name="clean_partial_conns"/> <Parameter name="delayack"/> </SubCat> <SubCat id="restricted"> <Parameter name="extendednetstats" readOnly="true"/> <Parameter name="inet_stack_size" readOnly="true"/>

| applyType              | The applyType attribute can take the values runtime (the default value) or nextboot . This attribute determines the command that is used to handle the parameter. For set operations, applyType = runtime indicates that the <Set type='permanent'> command from the catalog fi le should be used to set the parameter. The applyType = nextboot indicates that the <Set type='nextboot'> command should be used instead. For get operations, when the -p flag is used, applyType = runtime indicates that the <Get type='current'> command from the catalog fi le must be used to obtain the parameter. The <applyType> = nextboot indicates that the <Get type='nextboot'> command should be used instead. The applyType attribute must be set to nextboot if the reboot attribute is set to true. |

| reboot                                       | This attribute has a default value of false. When set to true, it means that the system must be rebooted before any change to the parameter is effective. This attribute must match the reboot attribute de fi ned in the corresponding <ParameterDef> element of the catalog fi le. When this attribute is set to true, the applyType attribute must be set to nextboot . When you set a parameter that has the reboot attribute set, a warning is displayed to the user, stating that a reboot operation is needed: 0590-206 A manual post-operation is required for the changes to take effect Please reboot the system Only set the reboot attribute to true when a change to the parameter value will not be effective until                                                                                                                    |
| readOnly                                     | This attribute indicates that the value of the parameter can be read by the artexget command, but that it will not be set using the artexset command, nor taken into account in a comparison operation with live values by using the artexdiff commands. The default value is false. A few situations that can warrant setting the readOnly attribute to true follow: â¢ The parameter is static and its value cannot be modi fi ed (e.g. the memory_frames parameter in the vmo command). â¢ Access to the parameter is restricted and it is not recommended for the user to modify it in automatic procedures. In this case, the set con fi guration methods should be de fi ned for this parameter in the catalog fi le, but a system administrator must remove manually the readOnly attribute from the pro fi le to be able to set the parameter. |
| setDiscover                                  | The setDiscover attribute, when set to true indicates that, when the artexset command is called with the -d flag, the discover command must be called to discover all instances of the target, and set all to the value stored in the pro fi le. The setDiscover default value is false. A value of true only makes sense if the parameter has target classes de fi ned in the catalog fi le. Do not specify this attribute when creating a sample pro fi le. Advanced users must add this attribute manually when deemed necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Other attributes

The type and disruptive attributes are informative attributes that are automatically set by the artextget command when it is called with the -i flag. Do not include these attributes when you are creating a sample pro fi le.

## Examples

1. The following example is an excerpt from the vmoProfile.xml sample catalog, showcasing the use of various optional attributes:
2. If you run the artexget -r command on the pro fi le from example 1 the following pro fi le is displayed:

```
<Profile origin="reference" readOnly="true" version="2.0.0"> <Catalog id="vmoParam" version="2.1"> <Parameter name="nokilluid"/> <Parameter name="memory_frames" readOnly="true"/> <Parameter name="kernel_heap_psize" reboot="true" applyType="nextboot"/> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

```
<Profile origin="get" version="2.0.1" date="2011-03-24T13:41:01Z"> <Catalog id="vmoParam" version="2.1"> <Parameter name="nokilluid" value="0"/> <Parameter name="memory_frames" value="393216" readOnly="true"/> <Parameter name="kernel_heap_psize" value="4096" applyType="nextboot" reboot="true"/> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

The &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element.

Parameter values

The value of a parameter can be set in a pro fi le either as an attribute if they are short enough, or as a child element of the &lt;Parameter&gt; element.

## Use

When writing a sample pro fi le, no value must be assigned to the parameters. The value of a parameter, if it exists, is automatically included in the pro fi le obtained by running an artexget command.

## The runtime and nextboot values

The concept of runtime and nextboot values is an important part of the AIX Runtime Expert framework.

The runtime value of the parameter is its current value retrieved on the system at the time the artexget command is run. The nextboot value is the value the parameter will have after the next reboot of the system.

For example, the parameter type\_of\_dump in the pro fi le sysdumpdevProfile.xml . The current ( runtime ) value of this parameter may be traditional or firmware-assisted . If this value is changed (using the artexset command or directly by using the sysdumpdev command), it will not be effective until the next reboot. The nextboot value of this parameter will then be the modi fi ed value.

```
<Parameter name="type_of_dump" applyType="nextboot" reboot="true" />
```

## Example

The following example shows a parameter with the value speci fi ed as an attribute, and another parameter with the value speci fi ed as a child element:

```
<Profile origin="get" version="2.0.1" date="2010-09-28T12:30:03Z">
```

```
<Catalog id="login.cfgParam" version="2.0"> <Parameter name="shells"> <Value> /bin/sh,/bin/bsh,/bin/csh,/bin/ksh,/bin/tsh, /bin/ksh93,/usr/bin/sh,/usr/bin/bsh,/usr/bin/csh, /usr/bin/ksh,/usr/bin/tsh,/usr/bin/ksh93, /usr/bin/rksh,/usr/bin/rksh93, /usr/sbin/uucp/uucico,/usr/sbin/sliplogin, /usr/sbin/snappd </Value> </Parameter> <Parameter name="maxlogins" value="32767"/> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

&lt;Property&gt; element

The &lt;Property&gt; element assigns a value to a parameter property.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Parameter&gt;

The following attributes are supported:

Table 11. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                            |
|-------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| name        | yes        | string | Speci fi es the name of the property.  |
| value       | no         | string | Speci fi es the value of the property. |

## Usage

The &lt;Property&gt; element assigns a value to the property name of the parent element. This value is used when the %p [name] sequence is expanded during command-line generation.

The &lt;Property&gt; element is generally not added manually to pro fi les. The element is inserted automatically in the output pro fi le when the artexget -r and artexget -n commands are run, based on the command de fi ned under the corresponding &lt;Property&gt; element of the catalog fi le.

## Example

The following example sets the nodeId property for the netaddr parameter. The property value is captured by the artexget -r command and is the output of the uname -f command:

```
<Parameter name="netaddr" value="172.16.128.13"> <Target class="device" instance="en0"/> <Property name="nodeId" value="8000108390E00009"/> </Parameter>
```

## &lt;Seed&gt; element

The &lt;Seed&gt; element de fi nes a seed that is expanded into one or more &lt;ParameterDef&gt; elements during the &lt;Get&gt; operation.

## Syntax

Parent element:

&lt;Catalog&gt;

The following attribute is supported:

## Table 12. Attribute

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name        | yes        | string | Speci fi es the name of the seed element that matches a SeedDef element in the catalog fi le. |

The following child elements are supported:

## Table 13. Child elements

| Child element Required   | Number   | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <Parameter> no           | 0 - any  | Filters discovered parameters based on the names of the parameters. |
| <Target> no              | 0 - any  | Filters discovered parameters based on their targets.               |

## Usage

The &lt;Seed&gt; element discovers parameters dynamically during a &lt;Get&gt; operation.

When the artexget command is issued, each &lt;Seed&gt; element in the input pro fi le is expanded into one or more &lt;Parameter&gt; elements. The pro fi les are expanded based on the rules de fi ned in the matching &lt;SeedDef&gt; element of the catalog fi le. This process is called parameter discovery. After the parameter discovery process is completed, the artexget command proceeds as usual with the expanded pro fi le.

The optional &lt;Parameter&gt; and &lt;Target&gt; child elements are used to fi lter the discovered parameters. Discovered parameters that do not match the criteria de fi ned in the &lt;Parameter&gt; subelement, are discarded. Also, those parameters that apply to targets that do not match the criteria de fi ned in the &lt;Target&gt; subelement, are discarded.

## Examples

This example uses the devSeed catalog to de fi ne a seed that can be used to discover all attributes of all devices:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Catalog id="devSeed" version="3.0"> <SeedDef name="devAttr"> <Discover> <Command> /usr/sbin/lsdev -F 'name class subclass type' | while read DEV CLASS SUBCLASS TYPE do CAT=devParam.$CLASS.$SUBCLASS.$TYPE /usr/sbin/lsattr -F attribute -l $DEV |
```

```
while read PAR do echo "device=$DEV $CAT $PAR" done done </Command> Mask target="1" catalog="2" name="3">(.*) (.*) (.*)</Mask> </Discover> </SeedDef> </Catalog>
```

The following pro fi le can be used to discover all the supported attributes of all the supported devices:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Profile> <Catalog id="devSeed" version="3.0"> <Seed name="devAttr"/> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

2. Using the same catalog, a &lt;Target&gt; fi lter can be used to discover all the supported attributes of all Ethernet adapters:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Profile> <Catalog id="devSeed" version="3.0"> <Seed name="devAttr"> <Target class="device" match="^en[0-9]+$"/> </Seed> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

3. A &lt;Parameter&gt; fi lter can be added to capture only the netaddr , netaddr6 , alias , and alias6 attributes of all Ethernet adapters:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Profile> <Catalog id="devSeed" version="3.0"> <Seed name="devattr"> <Parameter match="^(netaddr|alias)6?$"/> <Target class="device" match="^en[0-9]+$"/> </Seed> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

&lt;Target&gt; element

A &lt;Target&gt; element de fi nes the instance of a target class to which the parameter applies.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Parameter&gt;

Multiple occurrences of the same parameter from the same catalogs are allowed if, and only if, they apply to different instances of their target.

The following attributes are supported:

Table 14. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                                      |
|-------------|------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| class       | yes        | string | Speci fi es the name of the target class.        |
| instance    | no*        | string | Speci fi es the name of the instance of a class. |

|-------------|------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| match       | no*        | string | Speci fi es the regular expression as applied to the discovered instance names. |

* One and only one of the instance and match attributes must be speci fi ed.

## Use

Some parameters do not apply to the system as a whole, but to a speci fi c object. An example is the home directory of a user as speci fi ed in the chuserProfile.xml pro fi le; this parameter applies to a speci fi c user (root, guest) in a speci fi c loadable module ( fi les, LDAP). In this example, the user and the module are two target classes. The home parameter applies to speci fi c instances of these target class. For example, the guest instance of the user class, and the fi les instance of the module class.

If the class and instance attributes are both set to the empty string, then a discovery is performed for this parameter when the artexget command is run on such a pro fi le, the discovery method declared in the corresponding catalog fi le is executed, and a parameter is created in the output pro fi le for each discovered instance of the parameter. See example 1.

If the class and instance attributes are both speci fi ed, then the target is fully quali fi ed and the parameter only applies to the speci fi ed instance of the target class. See example 2.

If the class and match attributes are both speci fi ed, a discovery is performed as above, but only target instances with a name that matches the regular expression speci fi ed in the match attribute are discovered. See example 3.

When writing a sample pro fi le, the class and instance attributes must be left empty. This means that, when encountering the empty target class, the artexget command will discover the list of the instances of that target class (all the users or the subsystems on the system) before retrieving the values.

Running the artexset command on an undiscovered target class displays a warning:

```
0590-216 Some parameters in the profile require a target discovery and will be ignored
```

## Examples

1. An example of a pro fi le with targets before discovery is the chuserProfile.xml pro fi le that de fi nes the home directory of a user. The following example shows a sample pro fi le:
2. After discovery, the chuserProfile.xml pro fi le would contain a copy of the home parameter for each discovered user in each of the discovered loadable modules:

```
<Profile version="2.0.0" origin="reference" readOnly="true"> <Catalog id="chuserParam" version="2.0"> <Parameter name="home"> <Target class="" instance=""/> </Parameter> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

```
<Profile version="2.0.0" origin="get"> <Catalog id="chuserParam" version="2.0"> <Parameter name="home" value="/"> <Target class="user" instance="root"/> <Target class="module" instance="files"/> </Parameter> <Parameter name="home" value="/etc"> <Target class="user" instance="daemon"/> <Target class="module" instance="files"/>
```

```
</Parameter> ... </Catalog> </Profile>
```

3. The following pro fi le uses the match attribute to discover the home directory of all users with a name that starts with a u in the fi le module:

```
<Profile version="2.0.0" origin="reference" readOnly="true"
```

```
<Catalog id="chuserParam" version="2.0"> <Parameter name="home"> <Target class="user" match="^u"/> <Target class="module" instance="files"/> </Parameter> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

## Writing AIX Runtime Expert catalogs

Catalog fi les are used internally by the AIX Runtime Expert framework.

The catalog fi les contain the parameter de fi nitions and binding information to con fi guration methods that describe the commands used to retrieve or set parameter values. Catalog fi les are local to the system which is being tuned and con fi gured.

## AIX Runtime Expert catalog concepts

Catalog fi les contain all the information required to perform operations on parameters, including de fi nitions, conditions of use, and con fi guration methods. Catalog fi les must not be manipulated directly by users and are only used through the AIX Runtime Expert core engine.

Catalogs are installed on a system at the same time as the AIX Runtime Expert core engine. When new catalogs are linked to components or third-party applications that are installed on a system, it is important to ensure they are in level with the installed AIX Runtime Expert core engine.

## Catalog location

AIX Runtime Expert catalog fi les are stored in the /etc/security/artex/catalogs directory.

The name of a catalog fi le must exactly match its id attribute, suf fi xed with .xml extension. For example, a catalog named commandParam.xml must have an id attribute value commandParam .

In order to be located by the pro fi le that reference it, the catalog must have the same name in the catalog XML fi le and in the &lt;Catalog&gt; element of the pro fi le XML fi le. By default, the AIX Runtime Expert core engine looks for catalogs in the default directory /etc/security/artex/catalogs . This behavior can be changed, for the root user only, by setting the ARTEX\_CATALOG\_PATH environment variable. Multiple directories can be speci fi ed in this environment variable using the : separator.

## Catalog process

Steps to write a new AIX Runtime Expert catalog.

The following steps are required to be performed when writing a new AIX Runtime Expert catalog:

1. Make a list of parameters you want in the catalog fi le.
2. For each parameter, create a &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element
3. If several parameters use the same command for a &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , &lt;Discover&gt; or &lt;Diff&gt; operation:
- De fi ne a &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element at the top of the catalog.
- Use the cfgmethod attribute to inherit from the con fi guration method.

4. If several parameters are subject to the same constraint, de fi ne a &lt;ConstraintDef&gt; element at the top of the catalog.
5. For each parameter:
- a. De fi ne the &lt;Get type='current'&gt; and &lt;Get type='nextboot'&gt; operations for each parameter, either directly under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, or referenced under the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element, or using any of the combinations.
- b. De fi ne all the supported &lt;Set&gt; operations for each parameter, either directly under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, or under the referenced &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element, or using any combination of those possibilities.
- c. If the parameter requires a target:
- i) De fi ne the supported target classes using the targetClass attribute
7. ii) De fi ne the discover operation, either directly under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, or the referenced &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element, or using any combination of those possibilities. In most cases the discover method will be de fi ned in a con fi guration method.
- d. If the parameter requires a reboot for a change to take effect, add the reboot = true attribute.
- e. If the parameter is subject to a constraint, either de fi ne a &lt;ConstraintDef&gt; element under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, or use the constraint attribute to reference an existing constraint.
6. To test the catalog fi le:
- a. Create a pro fi le with all the parameters de fi ned in the catalog fi le.
- b. Use the artexget -r command to capture values and test the &lt;Discover&gt; and &lt;Get&gt; operations.
- c. Use the artexset -c -F -R -l all command on the resulting pro fi le to test the &lt;Set&gt; and &lt;Diff&gt; operations.
- d. Additionally, the -g 3 -g COMMANDS flags can be added to those two commands to get more information about the command line generated to perform the requested operation.

| Priority    | The priority attribute is used when the set methods of a speci fi c catalog are required to be run before or after the set methods of other catalogs when they are included in the same pro fi le (for example, the compound pro fi le default.xml ). The default priority of a catalog is 0. The rule is that when two catalogs share the same priority, their set methods are run in an unde fi ned order. If a catalog has a priority with a positive value, its set methods are executed before the others, in the descending priority order. If a catalog has a priority with a negative value, its set methods are executed after the others, in the descending priority order. |
| Version     | The Version attribute is present in both pro fi les and catalogs. The version helps identifying whether pro fi les and catalogs are compatible with the AIX Runtime Expert core engine and with each other. See Version attribute for more details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Date        | The date attribute is not currently used for the <Catalog> element. It is included for future use and maintainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| inherit     | The inherit attribute speci fi es the name of a catalog to inherit from, without the .xml extension. All the elements de fi ned in the inherited catalog are available in the main catalog, as if they were de fi ned locally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Example

Following is an example of a catalog using the priority attribute. The aixpertParam.xml catalog sets security options and must be set after all other catalogs have been set. Thus, its priority is set to a high negative value.

```
<Catalog id="aixpertParam" version="2.0" priority="-1000">
```

Version attribute

## Syntax

The version of a catalog is written as an attribute in the format MM.mm where MM is the major number and mm is the minor number.

```
<Catalog id="commandParam" version="2.0">
```

## Major version number

The major version number is the same for all AIX Runtime Expert catalogs installed on a system, and the whole AIX Runtime Expert framework, where it is referenced. This major number is increased at each major change of the XML schema of the pro fi les and catalogs.

When creating a new catalog, set the major version number to the current AIX Runtime Expert core engine version number, which can be found by looking inside any of the standard catalog fi les that come with the artex.base.rte fi leset.

If an artexget command is invoked on a pro fi le whose major version number differs from the one referenced in the AIX Runtime Expert core engine, the command fails with the following error:

```
0590-117 Version error This profile was created on a version unsupported by ARTEX
```

It is also advised that a pro fi le and a catalog share the same major version number in order to be compatible. A pro fi le references catalogs with a speci fi c version number. If the major version number of the pro fi le is not the same as the catalog major version number, any AIX Runtime Expert command will display a warning to inform the user that results may be unpredictable:

```
0590-218 Catalog version differs from the one referenced in profile
```

## Minor version number

The minor version number is speci fi c to each catalog and is increased each time a major change in the catalog makes it incompatible with the previous version. A pro fi le references catalogs with a speci fi c version number. If the pro fi le minor version number is not the same as the catalog minor version number, any AIX Runtime Expert command will issue a warning to inform the user that results may be unpredictable:

```
0590-218 Catalog version differs from the one referenced in profile
```

When creating a new sample pro fi le or catalog, set the minor version number to 0.

&lt;Description&gt; and &lt;ShortDescription&gt; elements

Descriptions are optional informative text fi elds that can be added to various elements in the catalog fi les. These fi elds are optional, but it is recommended that catalog writers use them to document the parent element.

## Syntax

The parent element of a &lt;ShortDescription&gt; element can be one of:

- &lt;Catalog&gt;
- &lt;SubCat&gt;

The parent element of a &lt;Description&gt; element can be one of:

- &lt;Catalog&gt;
- &lt;SubCat&gt;
- &lt;ParameterDef&gt;
- &lt;ConstraintDef&gt;

The content of the &lt;Description&gt; and &lt;ShortDescription&gt; elements is either a simple string, or a translated message de fi ned by one of the &lt;NLSCatalog&gt; , &lt;NLSSmitHelp&gt; or &lt;NLSCommand&gt; elements. See the Globalization support topic for more information.

## Usage

Currently, only the description of &lt;ParameterDef&gt; elements is retrieved and displayed by the artexget command with the -i flag. It is recommended to provide globalization for the text included in those description fi elds.

The description fi eld of the other elements are currently not used by the AIX Runtime Expert framework, but they should be provided for future use and for documentation purpose.

## Example

1. Here is a simple example of description fi elds:
2. The same example, using translated messages from the artexcat.cat message fi le:

```
<ShortDescription> chuser parameters </ShortDescription> <Description> Parameter definition for the chuser command </Description>
```

```
<ShortDescription> msgNum="1"> msgNum="2">
```

```
<NLSCatalog catalog="artexcat.cat" setNum="12" chuser parameters </NLSCatalog> </ShortDescription> <Description> <NLSCatalog catalog="artexcat.cat" setNum="12" Parameter definition for the chuser command </NLSCatalog> </Description>
```

## Globalization support

This section describes how globalization is implemented in the descriptive fi elds of the AIX Runtime Expert catalogs.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Description&gt; , &lt;ShortDescription&gt;

The parent element may contain one (and only one) of the following child elements:

| Table 18. Child Elements   | Table 18. Child Elements   | Table 18. Child Elements   | Table 18. Child Elements                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Child element              | Required                   | Number                     | Description                                             |
| <NLSCatalog>               | no                         | 0 - 1                      | String included in a message catalog                    |
| no                         |                            | 0 - 1                      | <NLSSmitHelp> String included in a SMIT help HTML fi le |
| <NLSCommand>               | no                         | 0 - 1                      | String issued by an AIX command                         |

## NLS Catalog

The NLS Catalog globalization format is used when the localized message to display is included in an existing message catalog in the catgets() format.

The &lt;NLSCatalog&gt; element contains the following attributes:

## Table 19. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type    | Description                                         |
|-------------|------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| catalog     | yes        | string  | Name of the catalog where the message resides       |
| setNum      | yes        | integer | Number of the message set where the message resides |

Table 19. Attributes (continued)

| Attribute   | Required   | Type    | Description                              |
|-------------|------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| msgNum      | yes        | integer | Number of the message in the message set |

If the localized message catalog does not exist, the default message is displayed instead. The default message is, optionally, included as the contents of the &lt;NLSCatalog&gt; element. It is a recommended practice to provide a default message.

## NLS SMIT Help

The NLS Smit Help globalization format is used when the localized message to display already exists in a SMIT help HTML fi le.

The &lt;NLSSmitHelp&gt; element contains the following attribute:

## Table 20. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type    | Decsription                                        |
|-------------|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| msgId       | yes        | integer | The help_msg_id fi eld provided in the SMIT stanza |

If the localized help fi le does not exist, the default message is displayed instead. The default message is, optionally, included as the contents of the &lt;NLSSmitHelp&gt; element. It is a recommended practice to provide a default message.

## NLS Command

The NLS Command globalization format is used when the localized message to display is issued by an AIX command. This is the case for all tuning commands (like no , vmo ) that provide a -h flag to display help text for a speci fi c parameter.

The &lt;NLSCommand&gt; element contains the following attribute:

| reboot                                       | The default for the boolean 'reboot' attribute is 'false'. If a parameter change requires a reboot to take effect, then this parameter must have its 'reboot' attribute set to 'true'. AIX Runtime Expert itself never reboots systems. By default, the artexset command will not force the setting of reboot parameters. If the pro fi le contains reboot parameters, the command will fail: 0590-502: profile has parameters that require a reboot. Profile has not been set. Use -l all flag to force set for all parameters If called with the proper -l flag, the artexset command sets the value and warns the users that a reboot is required for changes to take effect: 0590-206 A manual post-operation is required for thechanges to take effect |

The priority attribute can be used to change this default priority to any integer value between -2147483648 and 2147483647. Parameters with a higher priority are executed before parameters with a lower priority. The order in which parameters with the same priority are set is unde fi ned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Examples

1. Following is an example of a parameter de fi nition with an alternative integer type: kernel\_heap\_size , from the vmoParam.xml catalog fi le:

```
<ParameterDef name="kernel_heap_psize" type="integer-bi">
```

When extracting the value of this parameter through an artexget command, the result is something like (excerpted from the resulting pro fi le).

```
<Parameter name="kernel_heap_psize" value="16M"â¦ />
```

The parameter value will be interpreted differently, depending on the type:

- Since it is declared to be of type integer-bi, the value is 16M= 16,777,216.
- If the type had been integer-si, the value would have been '16M'=16,000,000.
2. Example of a binary parameter: the trusted signature database tsd.dat in the tsdParam.xml catalog:
3. Example of a parameter with a reboot attribute. The type of dump parameter in the sysdumpdevParam.xml catalog:
4. Example of a parameter with one target class: the addr parameter from the mktcpipParam.xml catalog applies to a speci fi c network interface:
5. Example of a parameter with several target classes: the naming speci fi cation parameter from the coreParam.xml applies to a speci fi c user (root, admin, guest, etc.) in a speci fi c registry ( fi les, LDAP).
6. Example of use of the cfgmethod attribute: For the &lt;Get type="current"&gt; operation, the fi xed parameter of the chlicenseParam.xml catalog inherits the &lt;Command&gt; element from the chlicense con fi guration method, but it also de fi nes its own &lt;Filter&gt; and &lt;Mask&gt; locally for this same operation:
7. Example of usage of the constraint attribute: the authorizations parameter of the authParam.xml catalog is subjected to the setkst constraint de fi ned earlier in a &lt;ConstraintDef&gt; element:

```
<ParameterDef name="tsdatabase" type="binary">
```

```
<ParameterDef name="type_of_dump" type="string" reboot="true">
```

```
<ParameterDef name="addr" type="string" cfgmethod="mktcpip" targetClass="interface">
```

```
<ParameterDef name="namingspecification" type="string" reboot="true" targetClass="user,registry" cfgmethod="coremgt">
```

```
<CfgMethod id="chlicense"> <Get type="current"> <Command>lslicense -c -A</Command> </Get> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name="fixed" cfgmethod="chlicense" type="integer"> <Get type="current"> <Filter>tail -n 1 | cut -d: -f3</Filter> <Mask value="1">(.*)</Mask> </Get> </ParameterDef>
```

```
<ParameterDef name="authorizations" cfgmethod="cat" constraint="setkst" type="string">
```

## name attribute

The name of a parameter is often dictated by the command used to get or set the parameter.

Parameter names must be unique within a catalog fi le. This is required to ensure that a &lt;Parameter&gt; element in a pro fi le can be associated with a unique &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element in a catalog fi le.

- If the get command displays several parameter-value pairs, then the &lt;Mask&gt; element can be used to extract multiple parameters from a single command output. This is only possible if the name of the parameter matches the name used in the output of the get command.
- If the set command accepts several parameter-value pairs, then the %n and %v1 sequences can be used in an &lt;Argument&gt; element to set multiple parameters with a single command. This is only possible if the name of the parameter matches the name used by the set command.

## Examples

1. Example: The raso -a command used in the rasoParam.xml catalog displays one parameter per line of display:

```
kern_heap_noexec = 0 kernel_noexec = 1 mbuf_heap_noexec = 0 mtrc_commonbufsize = 485
```

In this easy case, the parameter names will be kernel\_heap\_noexec , kernel\_noexec , etc.

2. Example: The command used in the get con fi guration method of the acctctlParam.xml catalog displays a result that is more dif fi cult to parse. Not only is the name of the parameter integrated into a non-formatted sentence, but both the parameter names and their values are localized. The get con fi guration methods will have to run the command while setting the environment variable LANG=C , and, in each line, replace the key words by pertinent parameter names:

```
Advanced Accounting is not running. Email notification is off. The current email address to be used is not set. Recover CPU accounting time in turbo mode is False.
```

In the above example, the variable names that have been chosen are accounting , email , email\_adddr and turacct .

&lt;ConstraintDef&gt; element

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Catalog&gt; , &lt;ParameterDef&gt;

The following attributes are supported:

Table 27. Attributes

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                                       |
|-------------|------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| id          | no*        | string | Speci fi es the name of the parameter constraint. |

- *This attribute must be speci fi ed for &lt;Constraint&gt; elements de fi ned at the catalog level.

The following child elements are supported:

Table 28. Child Elements

| Child Elements   | Required                                                    | Description   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| no               | Textual description of disruptive command.                  | <Description> |
|                  | no Disruptive operations before setting the parameter       | <PreOp>       |
| no               | Disruptive operations setting the parameter                 | <PostOp>      |
|                  | no Built-in disruptive operation element may occur multiple | <BuiltIn>     |

## Usage

Some tuning and con fi guration parameters may require disruptive operations for value changes to take effect. A disruptive operation is any operation that may temporarily interrupt access to a service or a device. Typical disruptive operations are restarting a daemon, unmounting or mounting a fi lesystem, bringing a network adapter card offline or online. The AIX Runtime Expert program uses constraints to show that a parameter requires a disruptive operations for changes to take effect. A &lt;ConstraintDef&gt; element is used to de fi ne such a constraint.

The constraint can be de fi ned either:

- Inside a &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, if the constraint only applies to the single parameter.
- At the catalog level, the &lt;ConstraintDef&gt; element must have an id attribute to allow the constraint to be referenced later in &lt;ParameterDef&gt; elements.

## Built-In constraint

The &lt;BuiltIn&gt; element does not contain any attribute or child element.

The built-in constraint de fi nes operations that are hard coded in the core engine. There is currently only one built-in constraint de fi ned: bosboot . The difference of built-in constraints with other disruptive operations is that the bosboot command is never run by AIX Runtime Expert. The core engine will only warn that a bosboot is required for changes to take effect.

```
0590-206 A manual post-operation is required for the changes to take effect Please perform a bosboot
```

## PreOp and PostOp constraint

The &lt;PreOp&gt; element de fi nes mandatory commands (shell expressions) to be run before the parameter value is set by the set con fi guration method. The &lt;PostOp&gt; element de fi nes mandatory commands to be run after the execution of the set con fi guration method.

An &lt;ConstraintDef&gt; element must contain 0 or one &lt;PreOp&gt; child element, and 0 or one &lt;PostOp&gt; child element.

## Examples

1. Example of a built-in constraint (at catalog level)

```
<ConstraintDef id="bosboot"> <Description> <NLSCatalog catalog="artexcat.cat" setNum="51" msgNum="3"> bosboot
```

```
</NLSCatalog> </Description> <Built>Inbosboot</BuiltIn> </ConstraintDef>
```

2. Example of &lt;PreOp&gt; constraint: The clic constraint in the trustchkParam.xml catalog. Note that in this example, the preop command does not run anything, but only checks the presence of a kernel extension required by the set command. If the kernel extension is not installed, then the constraint de fi ned in the &lt;PreOp&gt; element will fail and the set command will not be run:
3. Example of &lt;PostOp&gt; constraint: The set Kernel Security Tables constraint in the authParam.xml catalog. The modi fi ed databases need to be loaded only once in the kernel after all modi fi cations have been made.

```
<ConstraintDef id="clic"> <Description> <NLSCatalog catalog="artexcat.cat" setNum="48" msgNum="3"> Check that the clic.rte kernel extension is installed. </NLSCatalog> </Description> <Pre>Oplslpp -l "clic*"</PreOp> </ConstraintDef>
```

```
<ConstraintDef id="setkst"> Tables)
```

```
<Description> <NLSCatalog catalog="artexcat.cat" setNum="5" msgNum="3"> Send the authorizations database to the KST (Kernel Security </NLSCatalog></Description> <PostOp>/usr/sbin/setkst -t auth &gt;/dev/null</PostOp> </ConstraintDef>
```

&lt;CfgMethod&gt; element

Table 30. Child elements (continued)

| Child elements   | Required   | Number   | Description                                                            |

| <Property> no    |            | 0 - any  | Assigns a property to the parameters using the con fi guration method. |

## Usage

The &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element de fi nes a con fi guration method that can later be referenced by a parameter using the cfgmethod attribute of the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element. The parameter then inherits all the elements de fi ned under the referenced con fi guration method.

Depending on the parameter, using a con fi guration may offer several advantages over the local de fi nition:

- It simpli fi es the catalog fi le, avoiding duplication of the same command line elements for several parameters.
- It allows multiple parameters to be treated by a single command.

## Example

The vmoParam.xml catalog de fi nes a lot of parameters that all use the same con fi guration method. Here is a simpli fi ed version of this catalog:

```
<Catalog id="vmoParam" version="2.1"> <CfgMethod id="vmo"> <Get type="current"> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -a</Command> <Mask name="1" value="2">[[:space:]]*(.*) = (.*)</Mask> </Get> <Get type="nextboot"> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -r -a</Command> <Mask name="1" value="2">[[:space:]]*(.*) = (.*)</Mask> </Get> <Set type="permanent"> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -p%a</Command> <Argument>%n=%v1</Argument> </Set> <Set type="nextboot"> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -r%a</Command> <Argument>%n=%v1</Argument> </Set> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name="ame_maxfree_mem" cfgmethod="vmo" type="integer" /> <ParameterDef name="ame_min_ucpool_size" cfgmethod="vmo" type="integer" <ParameterDef name="ame_minfree_mem" cfgmethod="vmo" type="integer" /> ... </Catalog>
```

The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each parameter, either at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level or directly at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level.

## Usage

The &lt;Get&gt; element describes how the value of a particular parameter is captured. It can be used either directly under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, or under a &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element referenced in the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element using the cfgmethod attribute, or using a combination of those two possibilities.

Two Get elements should be de fi ned for each parameter, one for each supported value of the type attribute:

- Get type='current' identi fi es the method that will be run to retrieve the runtime value of the parameter.
- Get type='nextboot' identi fi es the method that will be run to retrieve the value that the parameter will have after the next reboot of the system.
- The get method to be run depends on the operation being performed:
- If the artexget command is called with the -r flag, the current get method is used.
- If the artexget command is called with the -n flag, the nextboot get method is used.
- If the artexget command is called with the -p flag, the method run depends on the parameters input to the applyType attribute. The current get method is used for the parameters that have their applyType attribute set to runtime and the nextboot get method is used for the parameters that have an applyType attribute of reboot.

| <Prereq>                   | no                         | 0 - any                    | Assigns a prerequisite operation |

Note: The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each parameter, either at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level or directly at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level.

## Usage

There are three types of &lt;Set&gt; elements that can be de fi ned for each parameter, identi fi ed by their required type attribute:

- Set type='current' de fi nes a set operation that only changes the value of the parameter for the current session. Any change made using the set operation will be lost after a reboot of the system.
- Set type='nextboot' de fi nes a set operation that only changes the value the parameter will take after the next reboot of the system. The current value is not modi fi ed.
- Set type='permanent' de fi nes a set operation that changes both the current and the nextboot value of the parameter.

The type of the set operation run is decided based on parameters included when the artexset command is run, based the parameter applyType attribute in the pro fi le. The following table summarizes the set methods that are run, depending on the set methods de fi ned in the catalog fi le depending on the applyType attribute for the parameter:

Table 35. Set Methods - set method types de fi ned and Parameter applyType attribute.

|   current |   nextboot |   permanent | runtime         | nextboot        |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|         0 |          0 |           0 | not set (error) | not set (error) |

Table 35. Set Methods - set method types de fi ned and Parameter applyType attribute. (continued)

|   current |   nextboot |   permanent | runtime                  | nextboot        |
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
|         0 |          0 |           1 | set permanent            | not set (error) |
|         0 |          1 |           0 | set nextboot + warning   | set nextboot    |
|         0 |          1 |           1 | set permanent            | not set (error) |
|         1 |          0 |           0 | set current + warning    | set nextboot    |
|         1 |          0 |           1 | set permanent            | not set (error) |

&lt;Diff&gt; element

The &lt;Diff&gt; element de fi nes how to build a command line to compare two values of a parameter.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;CfgMethod&gt; , &lt;ParameterDef&gt;

The following child elements are supported:

Table 36. Child elements

| Child elements   | Required               | Description   |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| no               | Command                | <Command>     |
| no               | Command-line arguments | <Argument>    |
| no               | Stdin arguments        | <Stdin>       |
| no               | Filter                 | <Filter>      |
| no               | Output capturing mask  | <Mask>        |

Note: The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each parameter, either at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level or directly at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level.

## Usage

The &lt;Diff&gt; element is usually not required, since the framework knows how to compare two parameter values internally based on the type (string, integer, integer-bi, binary, etc.). However, in case the internal comparison is not adapted for a particular parameter, it is possible to use an external command instead.

## Example

The following &lt;Diff&gt; element can be used for most parameters, even though using the internal comparison function is more ef fi cient. The &lt;Diff&gt; element uses the diff command to compare two fi les that contains the two values:

```
<Diff> <Command>/usr/bin/diff %f1 %f2; echo $?</Command> </Diff>
```

The &lt;Mask&gt; element.

&lt;Discover&gt; element

The &lt;Discover&gt; element de fi nes how to build a command line to discover targets for a parameter that supports them.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;CfgMethod&gt; , &lt;ParameterDef&gt;

The following child elements are supported:

Table 37. Child elements

| Child elements   | Required   | Number                                   | Description   |
|------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| no               | 0 - 1      | Command                                  | <Command>     |
| no               |            | 0 - any Assigns a prerequisite operation | <Prereq>      |

Note: The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each parameter, either at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level or directly at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level.

## Usage

A discover command is used to obtain the list of target instances for a given parameter.

The output of a discover command for a parameter that supports N target classes have the following format:

```
class_1=inst_1_1;class_2=inst_2_1;...;class_N=inst_N_1
```

```
class_1=inst_1_2;class_2=inst_2_2;...; class_N=inst_N_2class_1=inst_1_3; class_2=inst_2_3;...;class_N=inst_N_3 ...
```

The artexget command generates and runs a discover command for parameters that satisfy one of the following criteria:

- Contain a &lt;Target&gt; element with empty class and instance attributes. &lt;Target class="" instance="" /&gt;
- Contain at least one &lt;Target&gt; element with a match attribute: &lt;Target class="..." match="..." /&gt;

The artexset command additionally requires the following two criteria to be satis fi ed:

- The artexset command is called with the -d flag.
- The &lt;Parameter&gt; element in the pro fi le has the setDiscover attribute set to true.

## Examples

1. The mktcpipParam.xml catalog uses the following discover command to obtain the list of the network interfaces de fi ned on the system:

```
<Discover> 's/^/interface=/'
```

```
<Command> /usr/sbin/lsdev -C -c if -F "name" | /usr/bin/sed -e </Command> </Discover>
```

This command gives the following output:

```
interface=en0 interface=et0 interface=lo0
```

2. The chuserParam.xml catalog uses the following discover command to get to the list of all users for all loadable authentication modules:

```
<Discover> <Command> /usr/sbin/lsuser -a registry ALL | /usr/bin/sed -e "s/\(.*\) registry=\(.*\)/module=\2;user=\1/g" </Command> </Discover>
```

This command gives the following output:

```
module=LDAP;user=daemon module=files;user=daemon
```

```
module=LDAP;user=bin module=LDAP;user=sys module=LDAP;user=adm ... module=files;user=root module=files;user=bin module=files;user=sys module=files;user=adm ...
```

&lt;Command&gt; element

The &lt;Command&gt; element de fi nes the base command used to perform the operation de fi ned by the parent element.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , &lt;Diff&gt; , &lt;Discover&gt; , &lt;PrereqDef&gt; , &lt;Prereq&gt; , &lt;PropertyDef&gt; , &lt;Property&gt; , &lt;Command&gt;

## Usage

The content of the &lt;Command&gt; element is expanded as described in section Expansion of command line elements and combined with the other command line elements to form a complete command line. See section Command line generation for more details.

Some characters often found in shell expressions, such as &lt;, &gt; and &amp; are not allowed in XML documents. These characters must be replaced by the corresponding XML entity:

| Table 38. XML entities   | Table 38. XML entities   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Character                | XML entity               |
| <                        | &lt;                     |
| >                        | &gt;                     |
| &                        | &amp;                    |

Alternatively, a CDATA section can be used if the expression contains many of such characters. The CDATA sections start with &lt;![CDATA[ and ends with ]]&gt; .

The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each supported operation of each parameter, either at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level or at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level.

## Example

The envParam.xml catalog de fi nes a parameter called pro fi le that represents the contents of the /etc/ profile fi le. For this parameter, the &lt;Get&gt; element uses the cat command to capture the content of the /etc/profile fi le:

```
<ParameterDef name="profile"> /etc/environment</Command>
```

```
<Get type="current"> <Command>/usr/bin/cat </Get> </ParameterDef>
```

&lt;Argument&gt; element

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , &lt;Diff&gt; , &lt;PrereqDef&gt; , &lt;Prereq&gt; , &lt;PropertyDef&gt; , &lt;Property&gt;

## Usage

The content of the &lt;Argument&gt; element is expanded as described in section Expansion of command line elements and combined with the &lt;Command&gt; and or the &lt;Stdin&gt; elements to form a complete command line. See section Command line generation for more details.

Some characters often found in shell expressions, such as &lt;, &gt; and &amp; are not allowed in XML documents. These characters must be replaced by the corresponding XML entity:

| Table 39. XML entities   | Table 39. XML entities   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Character                | XML entity               |
| <                        | &lt;                     |
| >                        | &gt;                     |
| &                        | &amp;                    |

Alternatively, a CDATA section can be used if the expression contains many of such characters. CDATA sections start with &lt;![CDATA[ and ends with ]]&gt; .

## Example

The vmoParam.xml catalog uses the &lt;Argument&gt; element to add an argument to the vmo command for each vmo parameter in the pro fi le:

```
<CfgMethod id="vmo"> -p%a</Command>

&lt;Stdin&gt; element

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , &lt;Diff&gt; , &lt;PrereqDef&gt; , &lt;Prereq&gt; , &lt;PropertyDef&gt; , &lt;Property&gt;

## Usage

The content of the &lt;Stdin&gt; element is expanded as described in section Expansion of command line elements and the resulting data is written to the standard input of the command line generated for the operation de fi ned in the parent element.

## Example

The envParam.xml catalog de fi nes a parameter called pro fi le that represents the content of the /etc/ profile fi le. For this parameter, the set operation writes the value of the parameter to the standard input of the cat command to overwrite the /etc/profile fi le:

```
<ParameterDef name="profile"> /etc/profile</Command>
```

```
<Set type="permanent"> <Command>/usr/bin/cat &gt; <Stdin>%v1</Stdin> </Set> </Get>
```

&lt;Filter&gt; element

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Diff&gt; , &lt;PropertyDef&gt; , &lt;Property&gt;

## Usage

The content of the &lt;Filter&gt; element is a command to which the output of the command line generated for the operation de fi ned in the parent element is passed as input.

Some characters often found in shell expressions, such as &lt;, &gt; and &amp; are not allowed in XML documents. These characters will need to be replaced by the corresponding XML entity:

| Table 40. XML entities   | Table 40. XML entities   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Character                | XML entity               |
| <                        | &lt;                     |
| >                        | &gt;                     |
| &                        | &amp;                    |

Alternatively, a CDATA section can be used if the expression contains many of such characters. The CDATA sections start with &lt;![CDATA[ and ends with ]]&gt; .

## Example

The nfsParam.xml catalog uses the &lt;Filter&gt; element for the get operation of parameter v4\_root\_node to extract the root node from the output of the nfds -getnode command:

```
<ParameterDef id="v4_root_node"> <Get type="current"> <Command> /usr/sbin/nfsd -getnodes </Command> <Filter> /usr/bin/awk -F: 'NR == 2 { printf("%s", $1) }' </Filter> </Get> </ParameterDef>
```

## Usage

The &lt;Mask&gt; element de fi nes a regular expression that is applied on each line of command output to extract data from those lines. The data that is extracted depends on where the &lt;Mask&gt; element is used.

If no attributes are speci fi ed, the last line in the command output that matches the regular expression is used to extract the data. The extracted data is the part of the line that matches the regular expression. When used under a &lt;Get&gt; or &lt;Diff&gt; element, the extracted data is used as the parameter value. When used under a &lt;PropertyDef&gt; or &lt;Property&gt; element, the extracted data is used as the property value.

If only the value attribute is speci fi ed, it must be set to 1, and the regular expression must contain only one subexpression. The last line in the command output that matches the regular expression is used to extract the data. The extracted data is the part of the line that matches the fi rst (and only) subexpression. When used under a &lt;Get&gt; or &lt;Diff&gt; element, the extracted data is used as the parameter value. When used under a &lt;PropertyDef&gt; or &lt;Property&gt; element, the extracted data is used as the property value.

If the name and value attributes are speci fi ed, one of those attributes must be set to 1 and the other must be set to 2, and the regular expression must contain two subexpressions. A name and a value are extracted from each line of the command output that matches the regular expression. When used in a &lt;Get&gt; element, the name is used as the parameter name and the value as the parameter value. When used in a &lt;Diff&gt; element, the name is used as the parameter name and the value is used as the comparison result. Using this function, the values of several parameters can be extracted by using a single get command, and several parameters can be compared by using a single diff command.

When used in the &lt;Discover&gt; subelement of a &lt;SeedDef&gt; element, the catalog and name attributes must be speci fi ed. A catalog name and a parameter name are extracted from each line of the command output that matches the regular expression. If a catalog that matches the extracted catalog name is found on the system, and if it contains a de fi nition for a parameter that matches the extracted parameter name, a parameter is inserted into the pro fi le. The optional target argument can be added to extract a target de fi nition for each discovered parameter. The target de fi nition must follow the semicolon-separated list of class=instance pairs format, such as class1=instance1;class2=instance2;... format.

## Examples

1. The vmoParam.xml catalog uses the &lt;Mask&gt; element with the name and value attributes to extract all parameter values from a single vmo -a command:
2. Had the vmoParam.xml catalog been written in a way that one separate command was used to capture the value of each parameter, then the &lt;Mask&gt; element could have been used with just the value attribute set and no name attribute:
3. Or, by using a regular expression that matches only the value:

```
<CfgMethod id="vmo"> <Get type="current"> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -a</Command> <Mask name="1" value="2">[[:space:]]*(.*) = (.*)</Mask> </Get> </CfgMethod>
```

```
<CfgMethod id="vmo"> <Get type="current"> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -o %n</Command> <Mask value="1"> = (.*)</Mask> </Get> </CfgMethod>
```

```
<CfgMethod id="vmo"> %n</Command>
```

```
<Get type="current"> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -o <Mask>[^ ]*$</Mask> </Get> </CfgMethod>
```

From the three examples above, the fi rst is the most ef fi cient, since it requires only a single command to capture all the vmo command parameters. Examples 2 and 3 would generate a separate command for each vmo command parameter, since the parameter name is used in the &lt;Command&gt; element.

4. The following &lt;SeedDef&gt; element de fi nes a seed that can be used to discover all attributes of all devices. It uses a target to designate the device they operate on:

```
<SeedDef name="devAttr"> <Discover> <Command> /usr/sbin/lsdev -F 'name class subclass type' | while read DEV CLASS SUBCLASS TYPE do /usr/sbin/lsattr -F attribute -l $DEV | while read PAR do echo device=$DEV devParam.$CLASS.$SUBCLASS.$TYPE $PAR done done </Command> <Mask target="1" catalog="2" name="3">(.*) (.*) (.*) <Mark> </Discover> </SeedDef>
```

The discovery command prints each discovered device attribute on a separate line, by using the following format:

device=DeviceName devParam.Class.Subclass.Type AttributeName

For example,

```
device=en0 devParam.if.EN.en tcp_recvspace device=en0 devParam.if.EN.en tcp_sendspace device=ent0 devParam.adapter.vdevice.IBM,l-lan alt_addr device=ent0 devParam.adapter.vdevice.IBM,l-lan chksum_offload
```

The following attribute is supported:

Table 44. Attribute

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                                                                  |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name        | yes        | string | Speci fi es the name of the seed. This name must be unique for each catalog. |

The following child element is supported:

Table 45. Child element

| Child element   | Required   | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <Discover>      | yes        | Speci fi es the command that is used to discover parameters. |

## Usage

Seeds are used to discover parameters dynamically during a get operation.

When the artexget command is issued, each &lt;Seed&gt; element in the input pro fi le is expanded into one or more &lt;Parameter&gt; elements, based on the rules de fi ned in the matching &lt;SeedDef&gt; element of the catalog fi le. This process is called parameter discovery. The artexget command then proceeds as usual with the expanded pro fi le.

The &lt;SeedDef&gt; element contains only a &lt;Discover&gt; subelement, that de fi nes a command to run, and a mask to extract parameter names, catalog names (as colon-separated lists, without the .xml extension), and optionally targets from the output of the command (by using the class1=instance1;class2=instance2;... format). For each line of the output, the fi rst catalog from the colon-separated list that is found on the system is loaded. If a parameter de fi nition is found in this catalog, then a parameter is created in the output pro fi le that has the targets that were extracted from the line. Lines from the command output that do not match the mask, or for which no catalog fi le is found, or that have no parameter de fi nition if found in the catalog fi le, are ignored.

## Examples

1. The following catalog de fi nes a &lt;SeedDef&gt; element called vmoTunables that discovers all the nonrestricted vmo tunables seed supported by AIX Runtime Expert:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Catalog id="vmoSeed"> <SeedDef name="vmoTunables"> <Discover> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -x | /usr/bin/awk -F, '{ print "vmoParam:" $1 }'</Command> <Mask catalog="1" name="2">(.*):(.*)/Mask> </Discover> </SeedDef> </Catalog>
```

The discovery command prints each tunable on a separate line, preceded by the name of the catalog that de fi nes the tunables:

```
... vmoParam:enhanced_affinity_vmpool_limit
```

```
vmoParam:esid_allocator vmoParam:force_relalias_lite vmoParam:kernel_heap_psize ...
```

The following pro fi le uses the vmo tunables seed to capture all the nonrestricted vmo tunables seed supported by AIX Runtime Expert:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Profile> <Catalog id="vmoSeed"> <Seed name="vmoTunables"/> </Catalog> </Profile>
```

When the artexget -r command is run on the pro fi le, the command generates a pro fi le similar to the following example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Profile> <Catalog id="vmoParam"> ... <Parameter name="enhanced_affinity_vmpool_limit" value="10"/> <Parameter name="esid_allocator" value="0"/> <Parameter name="force_relalias_lite" value="0"/> <Parameter name="kernel_heap_psize" value="65536" applyType="nextboot" reboot="true"/> ... </Catalog> </Profile>
```

2. The following &lt;SeedDef&gt; element de fi nes a seed that is used to discover all attributes of all devices. The element uses a target seed to designate the device they operate on:

```
<SeedDef name="devAttr"> devParam.$CLASS.$SUBCLASS.$TYPE:devParam.$CLASS
```

```
<Discover> <Command> /usr/sbin/lsdev -F 'name class subclass type' | while read DEV CLASS SUBCLASS TYPE do /usr/sbin/lsattr -F attribute -l $DEV | while read PAR do echo device=$DEV .$SUBCLASS:devParam.$CLASS $PAR done done </Command> <Mask target="1" catalog="2" name="3">(.*) (.*) (.*)</Mask> </Discover> </SeedDef>
```

The discovery command prints each discovered device attribute on a separate line, by using the following format:

device=DeviceName devParam.Class.Subclass.Type:devParam.Class.Subclass:devParam.Class AttributeName

For example:

```
device=en0 devParam.if.EN.en:devParam.if.EN:devParam.if tcp_recvspace device=en0 devParam.if.EN.en:devParam.if.EN:devParam.if tcp_sendspace device=ent0 devParam.adapter.vdevice.IBM,l-lan:devParam.adapter.vdevice:devParam.adapter alt_addr device=ent0 devParam.adapter.vdevice.IBM,l-lan:devParam.adapter.vdevice:devParam.adapter chksum_offload
```

&lt;Prereq&gt; element

| Child element              | Required                   | Description                            |
| <Command>                  | Command                    | no                                     |

| <ErrMessage>               | no                         | Message to print if prerequisites fail |

Note: The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each prerequisite: at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level, at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level, or in a &lt;PrereqDef&gt; element.

## Usage

Prereqs are commands that condition the processing of a &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , and &lt;Discover&gt; operation for parameters that use this &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , and &lt;Discover&gt; operations. Parameters for which a prereq command fails (nonzero return code) are ignored, and the error message de fi ned in the prerequisite is displayed.

The &lt;Prereq&gt; element assigns a prerequisite to the parent &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , or &lt;Discover&gt; operation. The prerequisite is either de fi ned locally under the &lt;Prereq&gt; element, or inherited from a higer-level &lt;Prereq&gt; or &lt;PrereqDef&gt; element that has a matching id attribute.

A parameter has all the prerequisites de fi ned locally under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element. Also, the prerequisite has the properties de fi ned in the con fi guration method of the parameter, if a con fi guration method is used. The consequence is that if a prerequisite is de fi ned in a &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element, all the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; elements that use the con fi guration method will automatically have that prerequisite (although some of those elements might rede fi ne the prerequisite locally).

The &lt;Command&gt; , &lt;Argument&gt; , &lt;Stdin&gt; , and &lt;ErrMessage&gt; elements that de fi ne a prerequisite for a given operation are searched in this order:

- Under the &lt;Prereq&gt; subelement of the relevant operation of the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element.
- If the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element has a cfgmethod attribute, under the &lt;Prereq&gt; subelement that has a matching id of the relevant operation of the con fi guration method.
- Under the &lt;PrereqDef&gt; element of the catalog that has a matching id.

## Example

The following example de fi nes a prerequisite that checks that the netaddr and netaddr6 parameters are applied on the same system on which they were captured:

```
<ParameterDef name="netaddr" type="string" targetClass="device" cfgmethod="attr"> <Set type="permanent"> <Prereq> <Command>[[ `/usr/bin/uname -f` = %p[nodeId] ]]</Command> <ErrMessage>Parameter cannot be applied to a different node</ErrMessage> </Prereq> </Set> </ParameterDef> <ParameterDef name="netaddr6" type="string" targetClass="device" cfgmethod="attr"> <Set type="permanent"> <Prereq> <Command>[[ `/usr/bin/uname -f` = %p[nodeId] ]]</Command> <ErrMessage>Parameter cannot be applied to a different node</ErrMessage> </Prereq> </Set> </ParameterDef>
```

In this example, the test is run twice: once for the netaddr parameter, and once for the netaddr6 parameter. This dual processing is because each parameter has its own prerequisite with its own &lt;Command&gt; element. See , artex\_catalog\_elem\_PrereqDef.dita for an example that requires only one run of the test.

Note: The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each prerequisite: at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level, at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level, or in a &lt;PrereqDef&gt; element.

## Usage

Prereq are commands that condition the run of the &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , and &lt;Discover&gt; operations for parameters that use the &lt;Get&gt; , &lt;Set&gt; , or &lt;Discover&gt; operation. Parameters for which a prereq command fails (nonzero return code) are ignored, and the error message de fi ned in the prerequisite is displayed.

The &lt;PrereqDef&gt; element de fi nes a prerequisite. This prerequisites can later be associated with an operation of a parameter or a con fi guration method by using a &lt;Prereq&gt; element that has the same id attribute.

## Example

The following example de fi nes the nodeId prerequisite and assigns it to the netaddr and netaddr6 parameters:

```
<PrereqDef id="nodeId"> <Command>[[ `/usr/bin/uname -f` = %p[nodeId] ]]</Command> <ErrMessage>Parameter cannot be applied to a different node</ErrMessage> </PrereqDef> <ParameterDef name="netaddr" type="string" targetClass="device" cfgmethod="attr"> <Set type="permanent"> <Prereq id="nodeId"/> </Set> <Property name="nodeId"/> </ParameterDef> <ParameterDef name="netaddr6" type="string" targetClass="device" cfgmethod="attr"> <Set type="permanent"> <Prereq id="nodeId"/> </Set> <Property name="nodeId"/> </ParameterDef>
```

In this example, the test is executed only once, because the two parameters use the same &lt;Command&gt; element for their prerequisites, and the generated command line is the same for the two parameters.

&lt;Property&gt; element

The &lt;Property &gt; element assigns a property to a parameter or a con fi guration method.

## Syntax

| no              | Output capturing mask                      | <Mask>        |

Note: The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each property: at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level, at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level, or in a &lt;PropertyDef&gt; element.

## Usage

Properties are key-value pairs that are associated with a parameter. The value of the key-value pairs is retrieved by the artexget -r and artexget -n commands and saved in the output pro fi le. Property values saved in a pro fi le can be inserted into a command line by using the %p[property\_name] sequence.

The &lt;Property&gt; element assigns a property to a parameter or to a con fi guration method. The property is either de fi ned locally under the &lt;Property&gt; element, or inherited from a higher-level &lt;Property&gt; or &lt;PropertyDef&gt; element that has a matching name attribute.

A parameter has all the properties de fi ned locally under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element. Also, the parameter has all the properties de fi ned under the parameters con fi guration method, if a con fi guration method is used. The consequence is that if a property is de fi ned under a &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element, all the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; elements that use the con fi guration method will automatically have that property (although some of them might rede fi ne the property locally).

Property values are extracted from the output of a command line. The command line is built by combining the &lt;Command&gt; , &lt;Argument&gt; , &lt;Stdin&gt; , and &lt;Filter&gt; elements as described in the Command line generation section. You must use one of the following property values: the raw output of the command line or the portion of the output that matches the mask, if a &lt;Mask&gt; element is speci fi ed.

The &lt;Command&gt; , &lt;Argument&gt; , &lt;Stdin&gt; , &lt;Filter&gt; , and &lt;Mask&gt; elements that de fi ne a property are searched in this order:

- Under the &lt;Property&gt; element at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level.
- If the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element has a cfgmethod attribute, under the con fi guration method of the &lt;Property&gt; element that has a matching name attribute.
- Under the &lt;PropertyDef&gt; element of the catalog that has a matching name attribute.

## Example

The following example assigns a nodeId property to the netaddr and netaddr6 parameters:

```
<ParameterDef name="netaddr" type="string" targetClass="device" cfgmethod="attr"> cfgmethod="attr">
```

```
<Property name="nodeId"> <Command>/usr/bin/uname -f/<Command> <Mask>.*/<Mask> </Property> </ParameterDef> <ParameterDef name="netaddr6" type="string" targetClass="device" <Property name="nodeId"> <Command>/usr/bin/uname -f</Command> <Mask>.*</Mask> </Property> </ParameterDef>
```

In this example, the mask matches the whole line and is only used to exclude the newline character at the end of the command output.

In this example, the uname command is run twice: once for the netaddr parameter, and once for the netaddr6 parameter. The command is run twice because each parameter has its own property with its own &lt;Command&gt; element. See artex\_catalog\_elem\_PropertyDef.dita, for an example that requires only one run of the uname command.

&lt;PropertyDef&gt; element

The &lt;PropertyDef&gt; element de fi nes a property that can be used in a &lt;Property&gt; element.

## Syntax

Parent element: &lt;Catalog&gt;

The following attribute is supported:

Table 52. Attribute

| Attribute   | Required   | Type   | Description                           |
|-------------|------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| name        | yes        | string | Speci fi es the name of the property. |

The following child elements are supported:

| Table 53. Child element   | Table 53. Child element   | Table 53. Child element                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Child element             | Required                  | Description                                 |
|                           | no Command                | <Command>                                   |
|                           | no                        | <Argument> Command-line arguments           |
| <Stdin>                   | no                        | Arguments supported by the <Stdin> elements |

Table 53. Child element (continued)

| Child element   | Required   | Description           |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|
| <Filter>        | no         | Filter                |
| <Mask>          | no         | Output capturing mask |

Note: The &lt;Command&gt; element must be de fi ned for each property: at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level, at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level, or in a &lt;PropertyDef&gt; element.

## Usage

Properties are key-value pairs associated with a parameter. The value of the key-value pairs are retrieved by the artexget -r and artexget -n commands and saved in the output pro fi le. Property values saved in a pro fi le can be inserted into a command line by using the %p[property\_name] sequence.

The &lt;PropertyDef&gt; element de fi nes a property. This property can later be associated to a parameter or con fi guration method by using a &lt;Property&gt; element that has the same name attribute.

## Example

The following example assigns a nodeId property to the netaddr and netaddr6 parameters:

```
<PropertyDef name="nodeId"> <Command>/usr/bin/uname -f</Command> <Mask>.*</Mask> </PropertyDef> <ParameterDef name="netaddr" type="string" targetClass="device" cfgmethod="attr"> <Property name="nodeId"/> </ParameterDef> <ParameterDef name="netaddr6" type="string" targetClass="device" cfgmethod="attr"> <Property name="nodeId"/> </ParameterDef>
```

In this example, the uname command is run only once, because the two parameters use the same &lt;Command&gt; element for their property, and the generated command line is the same for the two parameters.

## Command-line generation

The AIX Runtime Expert framework relies on external commands to capture, set and optionally compare parameter values. This topic explains how command lines are built based on the syntax information provided in the catalog fi les.

## Operations

For each parameter, the following operations can be de fi ned:

- Get type="current" , used to capture the current value of the parameter.
- Get type="nextboot" , used to capture the value the parameter that the parameter will have after a reboot.
- Set type="current" , used to set the current value of the parameter. This parameter value is lost upon reboot.

- Set type="nextboot" , used to set the value the parameter that the parameter will have after a reboot.
- Set type="permanent" , used to set the current value of the parameter, knowing that this value will persist after a reboot.
- diff operation, used to compare two values of the parameter.
- Discover operation, used to fi nd targets for parameters that support them.
- Property, used to capture a property for a parameter.
- Prerequisite, used to condition the execution of a get, set, or discover operation for a given parameter.

Not all operations need to be de fi ned for all parameters. The two get operations and all the set operations supported by the parameters must be de fi ned. The diff operation is optional, and if it is not de fi ned, comparisons between parameter values are done internally based on the parameter type, such as string, and integer. The discover operation must be de fi ned only for parameters that have targets. Properties and prerequisites are only de fi ned when needed.

## Command line elements

For each operation supported by a parameter, up to fi ve different elements can be used to de fi ne how a command line can be built to perform the operation:

- &lt;Command&gt; element, used to de fi ne the base command, for handling parameters.
- &lt;Stdin&gt; element, used to de fi ne the data that will be written to the command line standard input.
- &lt;Argument&gt; element, used to insert parameter speci fi c data into a &lt;Command&gt; or &lt;Stdin&gt; element.
- &lt;Filter&gt; element, used to fi lter the output a command line for the get and diff operations.
- &lt;Mask&gt; element, used to extract data from the output of a command line for the get , diff , and property operations.

When an operation needs to be performed, the &lt;Command&gt; , &lt;Stdin&gt; , &lt;Argument&gt; and &lt;Filter&gt; elements de fi ned for the requested operation are combined together to generate a set of command lines, as explained in the artex\_catalog\_cmdline\_gen.dita#artex\_catalog\_cmdline\_gen/ CommandLineGenerationAlgorithm topic. The generated command lines are then run by a shell. For the get , diff , and property operations, the &lt;Mask&gt; element is used to extract the requested data (parameter values, comparison results, or property values) from the command output.

## Con fi guration methods

Command line elements can be de fi ned locally inside a &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, or inherited from a &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element referenced in the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element using the cfgmethod attribute.

Combination are permitted: the set of command line elements de fi ned for a speci fi c operation of a speci fi c parameter is the union of the command line elements de fi ned locally under the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element, and the command line elements de fi ned for the same operation in the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; element referenced by the cfgmethod attribute of the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element. If the same command line element is de fi ned both locally and in a con fi guration method, then the local de fi nition takes precedence.

For example, in this non-optimized catalog fi le:

```
<CfgMethod id='vmo'> <Get type='nextboot'> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -r%a</Command> <Mask name="1" value="2">[[:space:]]*(.*) = </Get> <Set type='permanent'> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -p -o%a</Command> <Argument> -o %n=%p</Argument> </Set> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name='lgpg_size' cfgmethod='vmo'> <Get type='current'>
```

```
(.*)</Mask> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -o lgpg_size</Command>
```

```
<Mask name="1" value="2">[[:space:]]*(.*) = (.*)</Mask>
```

```
</Get> <Get type='nextboot'> <Argument> -o lgpg_size</Argument> </Get> </ParameterDef>
```

We can see that:

- The &lt;Get type="current"&gt; operation is entirely de fi ned at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level.
- The &lt;Get type="nextboot"&gt; operation has some elements de fi ned at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level ( &lt;Command&gt; and &lt;Mask&gt; ) and some elements de fi ned at the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; level ( &lt;Argument&gt; ).
- The &lt;Get type="current"&gt; operation is entirely de fi ned at the &lt;CfgMethod&gt; level.

Using a con fi guration method offers two main advantages:

- It simpli fi es the catalog. In many cases parameter de fi nitions will inherit all their command line element from a con fi guration method, and the &lt;ParameterDef&gt; element will be empty.
- It allows different parameters to be grouped together in a single command line, when possible.

## Command line generation algorithm

Command lines are generated using an algorithm that allows several parameters to be grouped in a single command.

Parameter grouping is not only desirable from a performance and ef fi ciency standpoint it is also necessary for certain parameters. For example, the vmo parameters lgpg\_regions and lgpg\_size , which cannot be set independently and need to be set together in a single vmo command invocation.

The command line generation algorithm is functionally equivalent to the following steps:

1. Each parameter in the input pro fi le has its &lt;Command&gt; and &lt;Stdin&gt; elements partially expanded. During this phase, the %a, %v1[name], %v2[name], %f1[name] and %f2[name] sequences are ignored and not expanded.
2. Parameters that verify all fi ve conditions below are grouped together:
- Parameters use the same &lt;Command&gt; element.
- Parameters use the same &lt;Stdin&gt; element.
- Parameters use the same &lt;Filter&gt; element.
- The expansion of the &lt;Command&gt; element performed during step 1 produced identical strings.
- The expansion of their &lt;Stdin&gt; element performed during step 1 produced identical strings.

The group now has its own, partially expanded &lt;Command&gt; and &lt;Stdin&gt; elements and its own &lt;Filter&gt; element, shared by all the parameters in the group.

3. For each group of parameters, the group &lt;Command&gt; and &lt;Stdin&gt; elements have the %v1[name], %v2[name], %f1[name] and %f2[name] sequences expanded. Parameter name is only searched within the group.
4. For each group of parameters, the group &lt;Command&gt; and &lt;Stdin&gt; elements have the %a sequences expanded: each parameter in the group has its &lt;Argument&gt; element expanded, and the concatenation of those expanded &lt;Argument&gt; elements replaces any %a sequence in the &lt;Command&gt; and &lt;Stdin&gt; elements.

The result of this process is a set of command lines, with optionally data to write on their standard input and a command to fi lter their output.

## Expansion of command line elements

The &lt;Command&gt; , &lt;Stdin&gt; and &lt;Argument&gt; elements support special sequences that are expanded by the AIX Runtime Expert framework to produce the fi nal command lines.

The table below is a short reference of all the supported sequences. For more details on a sequence, refer to the sections below.

| Table 54. Sequence   |                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sequence             | Expands to                                                                                                            |
| %%                   | The literal %character.                                                                                               |
| %a                   | The concatenation of the expanded Argument strings for all parameters that can be processed in the same command line. |
| %n                   | The name of the parameter.                                                                                            |
| %v1                  | The value of the parameter.                                                                                           |
| %v2                  | The second value of the parameter. Only valid for diff operations.                                                    |
| %f1                  | The name of the temporary fi le that will contain the value of the parameter.                                         |
| %f2                  | The name of the temporary fi le that will contain the second value of the parameter. Only valid for diff operations.  |
| %v1[name]            | The value of parameter name.                                                                                          |
| %v2[name]            | The second value of parameter name. Only valid for diff operations.                                                   |
| %f1[name]            | The name of a temporary fi le that will contain the value of the parameter name.                                      |
| %f2[name]            | The name of a temporary fi le that will contain the second value of parameter name. Only valid for diff operations.   |
| %t[class]            | The name of the target instance for the target class.                                                                 |
| %p[name]             | The value of property name .                                                                                          |

## Escaping of % sequences

Parameter names, parameter values and target names that are expanded by the AIX Runtime Expert are enclosed between single quotes when they are used inside a &lt;Command&gt; element or inside an &lt;Argument&gt; element that is to be inserted (via the %a sequence) into a &lt;Command&gt; element. This is to ensure that those strings will be passed to the shell as a single word, even if they include spaces or other special characters. Additionally, any single quote character within the expanded expression is properly escaped.

The catalog writers must be careful to not use the %n, %v1, %v2, %v1[name], %v2[name] or %t[class] sequences inside a quoted string. If those sequences must be used within a string, the string must be closed before the % sequence as shown in the following example:

```
echo "Parameter "%n" is set to "%v1
```

Failure to do so will result in incorrect command lines and is a security risk.

## The %% sequence

The %% sequence expands to the literal % character.

```
For example, the string: /bin/ps -aeF"%%a" expands to the following string: /bin/ps -aeF"%a"
```

## The %a sequence

The %a sequence can be used either in the &lt;Command&gt; string, or in the &lt;Stdin&gt; string. It is substituted with the concatenation of all the expanded &lt;Argument&gt; strings of all the parameters that can be treated in the same command (see the Command line generation topic for a formal description on parameter grouping).

For example, the following catalog (note that it could be simpli fi ed by using the %n sequence) :

```
<CfgMethod id='vmo'> <Get type='current' <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo%a</Command> </Get> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name='lgpg_size' cfgmethod='vmo'> <Get type='current'> <Argument> -o lgpg_size</Argument> </Get> </ParameterDef> <ParameterDef name='lgpg_regions' cfgmethod='vmo'> <Get type='current'> <Argument> -o lgpg_regions</Argument> </Get> </ParameterDef>
```

And the following pro fi le:

```
<Parameter name='lgpg_size' /> <Parameter name='lgpg_regions' />
```

will produce the following command line for the 'get current' operation:

```
/usr/sbin/vmo -o lgpg_size -o lgpg_regions
```

## The %n sequence

The %n sequence is substituted with the name of the parameter.

Using the %n sequence, the example from the %a section could be simpli fi ed as follows:

```
<CfgMethod id='vmo'> <Get type='current'> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo%a</Command> <Argument> -o %n</Argument> </Get> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name='lgpg_size' cfgmethod='vmo' /> <ParameterDef name='lgpg_regions' cfgmethod='vmo' />
```

With the following pro fi le:

```
<Parameter name='lgpg_size' /> <Parameter name='lgpg_regions' /> The following command line would be generated for the get current operation: /usr/sbin/vmo -o 'lgpg_size' -o 'lgpg_regions'
```

## The %v1 and %v2 sequences

The %v1 sequence is substituted with the value of the parameter.

The %v2 sequence is only valid for &lt;Diff&gt; operations and is substituted with the second value of the parameter.

For example, the following catalog:

```
<CfgMethod id='vmo'> <Set type='permanent'> <Command>/usr/sbin/vmo -p%a</Command> <Argument> -o %n=%v1</Argument> </Set> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name='lgpg_size' cfgmethod='vmo' /> <ParameterDef name='lgpg_regions' cfgmethod='vmo' />
```

with the following pro fi le:

```
<Parameter name='lgpg_size' value='16M'/> <Parameter name='lgpg_regions' value='128' /> would generate the following command line for the set permanent operation:
```

```
/usr/sbin/vmo -p -o 'lgpg_size'='16M' -o 'lgpg_regions'='128'
```

## The %f1 and %f2 sequences

The %f1 and %f2 sequences are substituted with the name of temporary fi le created before the command is executed. The fi le content is the value of the parameter for %f1 and the second value of the parameter for %f2. The %f2 sequence can only be used for &lt;Diff&gt; operations.

For example, the following catalog:

```
<ParameterDef name='some_file'> <Diff> <Command>/usr/bin/diff %f1 %f2</Command> </Diff> </ParameterDef>
```

When an artexdiff is performed between the two pro fi les including the same parameter with a different value:

```
<Parameter name='some_file' value='foo' /> <Parameter name='some_file' value='bar' />
```

```
Then two temporary fi les /tmp/file1 and /tmp/file2 (actual fi le names will be different) containing respectively the 'foo' and 'bar' strings will be created, and the following command will be executed: /usr/bin/diff /tmp/file1 /tmp/file2
```

## The %v1[name] and %v2[name] sequences

The %v1[name] sequence is substituted with the value of parameter name.

The %v2[name] sequence is only valid for &lt;Diff&gt; operations and is substituted with the second value of parameter name.

Those sequences are useful when a con fi guration command accepts several parameters at the same time, but require that some of them be placed in a particular position on the command line. This is the case of the chcons command for example, which requires that the path to the console device or fi le come last on the command line. Using the %v1[name] sequence, the chcons catalog could be written as follows:

```
<CfgMethod id='chcons'> <Set type='nextboot'> <Command>/usr/sbin/chcons%a %v1[console_device]</Command> <Argument> -a %n=%v1</Argument> </Set> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name='console_device' cfgmethod='chcons' reboot='true' /> <ParameterDef name='console_logname' cfgmethod='chcons' reboot='true' /> <ParameterDef name='console_logsize' cfgmethod='chcons' reboot='true' />
```

with the following pro fi le:

```
<Parameter name='console_device' value='/dev/vty0'/> <Parameter name='console_logname' value='/var/adm/ras/conslog' /> <Parameter name='console_logverb' value='9' />
```

This catalog would generate the following command line for the set nextboot operation:

```
/usr/sbin/chcons -a 'console_logname'='/var/adm/ras/conslog' -a 'console_logverb'='9' /dev/vty0
```

## The %f1[name] and %f2[name] sequences

The %f1[name] and %f2[name] sequences are substituted with the name of temporary fi le created before the command is executed. The fi le content is the value of parameter name for %f1[name] and the second value of parameter name for %f2[name]. The %f2[name] sequence can only be used for &lt;Diff&gt; operations.

## The %t[class] sequences

The %t[class] sequence is substituted with the name of the target instance being treated for target class.

The %t[class] sequence is used for parameters that apply to a speci fi c object, not to the whole system. An example of this is the chuser command, whose parameters apply to a speci fi c user (root, guest) for a speci fi c registry ( fi les, LDAP). The catalog for the chuser command could be written as follows:

```
<CfgMethod id='chuser'> <Set type='permanent'> <Command>/usr/bin/chuser -R %t[module]%a %t[user]</Command> <Argument> %n=%v1</Argument> </Set> </CfgMethod> <ParameterDef name='shell' cfgmethod='chuser' targetClass='module,user'> <ParameterDef name='histsize' cfgmethod='chuser' targetClass='module,user' />
```

With the following pro fi le, which sets the shell and histsize parameters for users adam and bob in the LDAP and fi les registries:

```
<Parameter name='shell' value='/usr/bin/ksh'> <Target class='module' instance='LDAP' /> <Target class='user' instance='adam' /> </Parameter> <Parameter name='histsize' value='5000'> <Target class='module' instance='LDAP' /> <Target class='user' instance='adam' /> </Parameter> <Parameter name='shell' value='/usr/bin/ksh'> <Target class='module' instance='files' /> <Target class='user' instance='adam' /> </Parameter>
```

```
<Parameter name='histsize' value='5000'> <Target class='module' instance='files' /> <Target class='user' instance='adam' /> </Parameter> <Parameter name='shell' value='/usr/bin/bash'> <Target class='module' instance='LDAP' /> <Target class='user' instance='bob' /> </Parameter> <Parameter name='histsize' value='10000'> <Target class='module' instance='LDAP' /> <Target class='user' instance='bob' /> </Parameter> <Parameter name='shell' value='/usr/bin/bash'> <Target class='module' instance='files' /> <Target class='user' instance='bob' /> </Parameter> <Parameter name='histsize' value='10000'> <Target class='module' instance='files' /> <Target class='user' instance='bob' /> </Parameter>
```

It would execute the following commands:

```
/usr/bin/chuser -R 'LDAP' 'shell'='/usr/bin/ksh' 'histsize'='5000' 'adam' /usr/bin/chuser -R 'files' 'shell'='/usr/bin/ksh' 'histsize'='5000' 'adam' /usr/bin/chuser -R 'LDAP' 'shell'='/usr/bin/bash' 'histsize'='10000' 'bob' /usr/bin/chuser -R 'files' 'shell'='/usr/bin/bash' 'histsize'='10000' 'bob'
```

Notice how four commands were generated. The reason is that the %t[module] and %t[user] sequences were used in the &lt;Command&gt; string, meaning that each command is speci fi c to a particular module and user. Because of this, only parameters that apply to the same module and user are grouped together.

## The %p[name] sequence

The %p[name] sequence is substituted with the value speci fi ed in the input pro fi le for property name. For example, the following prerequisite uses the %p[nodeId] sequence to check that the node id of the local system (returned by the uname -f command) matches the node id stored in the nodeId property of the pro fi le:

```
<PrereqDef id="nodeId"> <Command>[[ `/usr/bin/uname -f` = %p[nodeId] ]]</Command> <ErrMessage>Parameter cannot be applied to a different node</ErrMessage> </PrereqDef>
```

## The %c sequence

The %c sequence is substituted with the id of the catalog fi le that the parameter belongs to. This is the catalog id speci fi ed in the pro fi le, which can be different from the id of the catalog that actually de fi nes the parameter if catalog inheritance is used.

For example, the following prerequisite uses the %c sequence to check that the uniquetype of the target device matches the name of the catalog fi le:

```
<PrereqDef id="devUniqueType"> <Command>[[ "devParam.`/usr/sbin/lsdev -F uniquetype -l %t[device] | /usr/bin/tr / .`" = %c ]]</Command> <ErrMessage>Parameter cannot be applied to a different device type</ErrMessage> </PrereqDef>
```

## Commands and processes

A command is a request to perform an operation or run a program. A process is a program or command that is actually running on the computer.

You use commands to tell the operating system what task you want it to perform. When commands are entered, they are deciphered by a command interpreter (also known as a shell ), and that task is processed.

The operating system can run many different processes at the same time.

The operating system allows you to manipulate the input and output (I/O) of data to and from your system by using speci fi c I/O commands and symbols. You can control input by specifying the location from which to gather data. For example, you can specify to read input entered on the keyboard (standard input) or to read input from a fi le. You can control output by specifying where to display or store data. For example, you can specify to write output data to the screen (standard output) or to write it to a fi le.

## Commands

Some commands can be entered simply by typing one word. It is also possible to combine commands so that the output from one command becomes the input for another command.

Combining commands so that the output from one command becomes the input for another command is known as piping .

Flags further de fi ne the actions of commands. A flag is a modi fi er used with the command name on the command line, usually preceded by a dash.

Commands can also be grouped together and stored in a fi le. These fi les are known as shell procedures or shell scripts . Instead of executing the commands individually, you execute the fi le that contains the commands.

To enter a command, type the command name at the prompt, and press Enter.

$ CommandName

Shell features

There are advantages to using the shell as an interface to the system.

## Related tasks

## Creating and running a shell script

A shell script is a fi le that contains one or more commands. Shell scripts provide an easy way to carry out tedious commands, large or complicated sequences of commands, and routine tasks. When you enter the name of a shell script fi le, the system executes the command sequence contained by the fi le.

## Command syntax and command names

Although some commands can be entered by simply typing one word, other commands use flags and parameters. Each command has a syntax that designates both the required and optional flags and parameters.

The general format for a command is as follows:

```
CommandName flag(s) parameter(s)
```

The following are some general rules about commands:

- Spaces between commands, flags, and parameters are signi fi cant.
- Two commands can be entered on the same line by separating the commands with a semicolon (;). For example:

```
$ CommandOne ; CommandTwo
```

The shell runs the commands sequentially.

- Commands are case-sensitive. The shell distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. To the shell, print is not the same as PRINT or Print .

- A very long command can be entered on more than one line by using the backslash ( \ ) character. A backslash signi fi es line continuation to the shell. The following example is one command that spans two lines:

```
$ ls Mail info temp \ (press Enter) > diary (the > prompt appears)
```

The &gt; character is your secondary prompt ( $ is the nonroot user's default primary prompt), indicating that the current line is the continuation of the previous line. Note that csh (the C shell) gives no secondary prompt, and the break must be at a word boundary, and its primary prompt is % .

The fi rst word of every command is the command name. Some commands have only a command name.

## Command flags

A number of flags might follow the command name. Flags modify the operation of a command and are sometimes called options .

A flag is set off by spaces or tabs and usually starts with a dash (-). Exceptions are ps , tar , and ar , which do not require a dash in front of some of the flags. For example, in the following command:

```
ls -a -F
```

ls is the command name, and -a -F are the flags.

When a command uses flags, they come directly after the command name. Single-character flags in a command can be combined with one dash. For example, the previous command can also be written as follows:

```
ls -aF
```

There are some circumstances when a parameter actually begins with a dash ( -). In this case, use the delimiter dash dash ( -) before the parameter. The -tells the command that whatever follows is not a flag but a parameter.

For example, if you want to create a directory named -tmp and you type the following command:

```
mkdir -tmp The system displays an error message similar to the following: mkdir: Not a recognized flag: t Usage: mkdir [-p] [-m mode] Directory ... The correct way of typing the command is as follows: mkdir ---tmp
```

Your new directory, -tmp , is now created.

## Command parameters

After the command name, there might be a number of flags, followed by parameters. Parameters are sometimes called arguments or operands. Parameters specify information that the command needs in order to run.

If you do not specify a parameter, the command might assume a default value. For example, in the following command:

```
ls -a temp
```

ls is the command name, -a is the flag, and temp is the parameter. This command displays all ( -a ) the fi les in the directory temp .

In the following example:

```
ls -a
```

the default value is the current directory because no parameter is given.

In the following example:

```
ls temp mail
```

no flags are given, and temp and mail are parameters. In this case, temp and mail are two different directory names. The ls command displays all but the hidden fi les in each of these directories.

Whenever a parameter or option-argument is, or contains, a numeric value, the number is interpreted as a decimal integer, unless otherwise speci fi ed. Numerals in the range 0 to INT\_MAX , as de fi ned in the /usr/include/sys/limits.h fi le, are syntactically recognized as numeric values.

If a command you want to use accepts negative numbers as parameters or option-arguments, you can use numerals in the range INT\_MIN to INT\_MAX , both as de fi ned in the /usr/include/sys/limits.h fi le. This does not necessarily mean that all numbers within that range are semantically correct. Some commands have a built-in speci fi cation permitting a smaller range of numbers, for example, some of the print commands. If an error is generated, the error message lets you know the value is out of the supported range, not that the command is syntactically incorrect.

## Usage statements

Usage statements are a way to represent command syntax and consist of symbols such as brackets ([ ]), braces ({ }), and vertical bars (|).

The following is a sample of a usage statement for the unget command:

unget [ -r SID ] [ -s ] [ -n ] File ...

The following conventions are used in the command usage statements:

- Items that must be entered literally on the command line are in bold . These items include the command name, flags, and literal characters.
- Items representing variables that must be replaced by a name are in italics . These items include parameters that follow flags and parameters that the command reads, such as Files and Directories .
- Parameters enclosed in brackets are optional.
- Parameters enclosed in braces are required.
- Parameters not enclosed in either brackets or braces are required.
- A vertical bar signi fi es that you choose only one parameter. For example, [ a | b ] indicates that you can choose a, b, or nothing. Similarly, { a | b } indicates that you must choose either a or b.
- Ellipses ( ... ) signify the parameter can be repeated on the command line.
- The dash ( -) represents standard input.

## Shutdown command

If you have root user authority, you can use the shutdown command to stop the system. If you are not authorized to use the shutdown command, simply log out of the operating system and leave it running.

<!-- image -->

Attention: Do not turn off the system without fi rst shutting down. Turning off the system ends all processes running on the system. If other users are working on the system, or if jobs are running in the background, data might be lost. Perform proper shutdown procedures before you stop the system.

At the prompt, type the following:

shutdown

When the shutdown command completes and the operating system stops running, you receive the following message:

```
....Shutdown completed....
```

```
See the shutdown command for the complete syntax.
```

## Locating another command or program (whereis command)

The whereis command locates the source, binary, and manuals sections for speci fi ed fi les. The command attempts to fi nd the desired program from a list of standard locations.

See the following examples:

- To fi nd fi les in the current directory that have no documentation, type the following:

```
whereis -m -u * Â· To fi nd all of the fi les that contain the name Mail , type the following: whereis Mail The system displays information similar to the following: Mail: /usr/bin/Mail /usr/lib/Mail.rc
```

## Displaying information about a command (man command)

The man command displays information on commands, subroutines, and fi les.

The general format for the man command is as follows:

```
man CommandName To obtain information about the pg command, type the following: man pg
```

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
pg Command Purpose Formats files to the display. Syntax pg [ -Number ] [ -c ] [ -e ] [ -f ] [ -n ] [ -p String ] [ -s ] [ +LineNumber | +/Pattern/ ] [ File ... ] Description The pg command reads a file name from the File parameter and writes the file to standard output one screen at a time. If you specify a -(dash) as the File parameter, or run the pg command without options, the pg command reads standard input. Each screen is followed by a prompt. If you press the Enter key, another page is displayed. Subcommands used with the pg command let you review or search in the file.
```

## Displaying the function of a command (whatis command)

The whatis command looks up a given command, system call, library function, or special fi le name, as speci fi ed by the Command parameter, from a database you create using the catman -w command.

For information about the catman -w command, see catman -w . The whatis command displays the header line from the manual section. You can then issue the man command to obtain additional information. For more information about the man command, see man .

The whatis command is equivalent to using the man -f command.

To fi nd out what the ls command does, type the following:

```
whatis ls
```

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
ls(1) -Displays the contents of a directory.
```

## Listing previously entered commands (history command)

Use the history command to list commands that you have previously entered.

The history command is a Korn shell built-in command that lists the last 16 commands entered. The Korn shell saves commands that you entered to a command history fi le, usually named $HOME/.sh\_history . Using this command saves time when you need to repeat a previous command.

By default, the Korn shell saves the text of the last 128 commands for nonroot users and 512 commands for the root user. The history fi le size (speci fi ed by the HISTSIZE environment variable) is not limited, although a very large history fi le size can cause the Korn shell to start slowly.

Note: The Bourne shell does not support command history.

To list the previous commands you entered, at the prompt, type the following:

history

The history command entered by itself lists the previous 16 commands entered. The system displays information similar to the following:

```
928 ls 929 mail 930 printenv MAILMSG 931 whereis Mail 932 whatis ls 933 cd /usr/include/sys 934 ls 935 man pg 936 cd 937 ls | pg 938 lscons 939 tty 940 ls *.txt 941 printenv MAILMSG 942 pwd 943 history
```

The listing fi rst displays the position of the command in the $HOME/.sh\_history fi le followed by the command.

To list the previous fi ve commands, at the prompt, type the following:

```
history -5
```

A listing similar to the following is displayed:

```
939 tty MAILMSG
```

```
940 ls *.txt 941 printenv 942 pwd 943 history 944 history -5
```

The history command followed by a number lists all the previous commands entered, starting at that number.

To list the commands since 938, at the prompt, type the following:

```
history 938
```

A listing similar to the following is displayed:

```
938 lscons 939 tty 940 ls *.txt 941 printenv MAILMSG 942 pwd 943 history 944 history -5 945 history 938
```

## Related concepts

## Operating system shells

Your interface to the operating system is called a shell .

## Command history substitution

Use the fc built-in command to list or edit portions of the history fi le. To select a portion of the fi le to edit or list, specify the number or the fi rst character or characters of the command.

## Repeating commands using the r alias

Use the r Korn shell alias to repeat previous commands.

Type r , and press Enter, and you can specify the number or the fi rst character or characters of the command.

If you want to list the displays currently available on the system, type lsdisp at the prompt. The system returns the information on the screen. If you want the same information returned to you again, at the prompt, type the following:

r

The system runs the most recently entered command again. In this example, the lsdisp command runs.

To repeat the ls *.txt command, at the prompt, type the following:

r ls

The r Korn shell alias locates the most recent command that begins with the character or characters speci fi ed.

## String substitution using the r alias

You can use the r Korn shell alias to modify a command before it is run.

In this case, a substitution parameter of the form Old = new can be used to modify the command before it is run.

The following examples show how to use the r alias:

- If command line 940 is ls *.txt , and you want to run ls *.exe , at the prompt, type the following:

```
r txt=exe 940
```

This runs command 940, substituting exe for txt .

- If the command on line 940 is the most recent command that starts with a lowercase letter l , you can also type the following:

```
r txt=exe l
```

Note: Only the fi rst occurrence of the Old string is replaced by the New string. Entering the r Korn shell alias without a speci fi c command number or character performs the substitution on the immediately previous command entered.

## Editing the command history

Use the fc Korn shell built-in command to list or edit portions of the command history fi le.

To select a portion of the fi le to edit or list, specify the number or the fi rst character or characters of the command. You can specify a single command or range of commands.

If you do not specify an editor program as an argument to the fc Korn shell built-in command, the editor speci fi ed by the FCEDIT variable is used. If the FCEDIT variable is not de fi ned, the /usr/bin/ed editor is used. The edited command or commands are printed and run when you exit the editor. Use the printenv command to display the value of the FCEDIT variable.

The following are examples of how to edit the command history:

- If you want to run the command:

```
cd /usr/tmp
```

which is very similar to command line 933 , at the prompt, type the following:

```
fc 933
```

At this point, your default editor appears with the command line 933 . Change include/sys to tmp , and when you exit your editor, the edited command is run.

- You can also specify the editor you want to use in the fc command. For example, if you want to edit a command using the /usr/bin/vi editor, at the prompt, type the following:

```
fc -e vi 933
```

At this point, the vi editor appears with the command line 933 .

- You can also specify a range of commands to edit. For example, if you want to edit the commands 930 through 940, at the prompt, type the following:

```
fc 930 940
```

At this point, your default editor appears with the command lines 930 through 940. When you exit the editor, all the commands that appear in your editor are run sequentially.

## Creating a command alias (alias shell command)

An alias lets you create a shortcut name for a command, fi le name, or any shell text. By using aliases, you save a lot of time when doing tasks you do frequently. You can create a command alias.

Use the alias Korn shell built-in command to de fi ne a word as an alias for some command. You can use aliases to rede fi ne built-in commands but not to rede fi ne reserved words.

The fi rst character of an alias name can be any printable character except the metacharacters. Any remaining characters must be the same as for a valid fi le name.

The format for creating an alias is as follows:

```
alias Name = String
```

in which the Name parameter speci fi es the name of the alias, and the String parameter speci fi es a string of characters. If String contains blank spaces, enclose it in quotation marks.

The following are examples how to create an alias:

- To create an alias for the command rm -i (prompts you before deleting fi les), at the prompt, type the following:

```
alias rm="/usr/bin/rm -i"
```

In this example, whenever you enter the command rm , the actual command performed is /usr/bin/rm -i .

- To create an alias named dir for the command ls -alF | pg (which displays detailed information of all the fi les in the current directory, including the invisible fi les; marks executable fi les with an * and directories with a / ; and scrolls per screen), at the prompt, type the following:

```
alias dir="/usr/bin/ls -alF | pg"
```

In this example, whenever you enter the command dir , the actual command performed is /usr/bin/ls -alF | pg .

- To display all the aliases you have, at the prompt, type the following:

alias

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
rm="/usr/bin/rm -i" dir="/usr/bin/ls -alF | pg"
```

## International character support in text formatting

You can use text formatting commands to work with text composed of the international extended character set used for European languages.

The international extended character set provides the characters and symbols used in many European languages, as well as an ASCII subset composed of English-language characters, digits, and punctuation.

All characters in the European extended character set have ASCII forms. These forms can be used to represent the extended characters in input, or the characters can be entered directly with a device such as a keyboard that supports the European extended characters.

The following text-formatting commands support all international languages that use single-byte characters. These commands are located in /usr/bin . (The commands identi fi ed with an asterisk (*) support text processing for multibyte languages.

Text-formatting commands and macro packages not in the preceding list have not been enabled to process international characters.

## Related concepts

Multibyte character support in text formatting

Certain text formatting commands can be used to process text for multibyte languages.

## Text formatting with extended single-byte characters

If your input device supports characters from the European-language extended character set, you can enter them directly.

Otherwise, use the following ASCII escape sequence form to represent these characters:

The form \[ N ] , where N is the 2- or 4-digit hexadecimal code for the character.

Note: The NCesc form \&lt;xx&gt; is no longer supported.

Text containing extended characters is output according to the formatting conventions of the language in use. Characters that are not de fi ned for the interface to a speci fi c output device produce no output or error indication.

Although the names of the requests, macro packages, and commands are based on English, most of them can accept input (such as fi le names and parameters) containing characters in the European extended character set.

For the nroff and troff commands and their preprocessors, the command input must be ASCII, or an unrecoverable syntax error will result. International characters, either single-byte or multibyte, can be entered when enclosed within quotation marks and within other text to be formatted. For example, using macros from the pic command:

```
define foobar % SomeText %
```

After the define directive, the speci fi ed name, foobar , must be ASCII. However, the replacement text, SomeText , can contain non-ASCII characters.

## Multibyte character support in text formatting

Certain text formatting commands can be used to process text for multibyte languages.

These commands are identi fi ed with an asterisk ( * ) in the list under International character support in text formatting. Text formatting commands not in the list have not been enabled to process international characters.

If supported by your input device, multibyte characters can be entered directly. Otherwise, you can enter any multibyte character in the ASCII form \[ N ], where N is the 2-, 4-, 6-, 7-, or 8-digit hexadecimal encoding for the character.

Although the names of the requests, macros, and commands are based on English, most of them can accept input (such as fi le names and parameters) containing any type of multibyte character.

If you are already familiar with using text-formatting commands with single-byte text, the following list summarizes characteristics that are noteworthy or unique to the multibyte locales:

- Text is not hyphenated.
- Special format types are required for multibyte numerical output. Japanese format types are available.
- Text is output in horizontal lines, fi lled from left to right.
- Character spacing is constant, so characters automatically align in columns.
- Characters that are not de fi ned for the interface to a speci fi c output device produce no output or error indication.

## Displaying a Calendar

You can write a calendar to standard output by using the cal command.

The Month parameter names the month for which you want the calendar. It can be a number from 1 through 12 for January through December, respectively. If no Month is speci fi ed, the cal command defaults to the current month.

The Year parameter names the year for which you want the calendar. Because the cal command can display a calendar for any year from 1 through 9999, type the full year rather than just the last two digits. If no Year is speci fi ed, the cal command defaults to the present year.

The following are examples of how to use the cal command:

1. To display a calendar for February 2002 at your workstation, type:

```
cal 2 2002 2. Press Enter. 3. To print a calendar for the year 2002, type: cal 2002 | qprt
```

4. Press Enter.

## Displaying reminder messages

You can display a reminder message by reading a fi le named calendar . This fi le is created in your home directory with the calendar command. The command writes to standard output any line in the fi le that contains today's or tomorrow's date.

You can read a fi le named calendar , which you create in your home directory with the filepath command. The command writes to standard output any line in the fi le that contains today's or tomorrow's date.

The calendar command recognizes date formats such as Dec. 7 or 12/7. It also recognizes the special character asterisk (*) when it is followed by a slash (/). It interprets */7, for example, as signifying the seventh day of every month.

On Fridays, the calendar command writes all lines containing the dates for Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. The command does not, however, recognize holidays. On holidays the command functions as usual and gives only the next day's schedule.

## Using a typical calendar fi le

A typical calendar fi le might look similar to the following:

```
*/25 -Prepare monthly report Aug. 12 -Fly to Denver aug 23 -board meeting Martha out of town -8/23, 8/24, 8/25 8/24 -Mail car payment sat aug/25 -beach trip August 27 -Meet with Simmons August 28 -Meet with Wilson
```

To run the calendar command, type:

calendar

If today is Friday, August 24, the calendar command displays the following:

```
*/25 -Prepare monthly report 8/25
```

```
Martha out of town -8/23, 8/24, 8/24 -Mail car payment sat aug/25 -beach trip August 27 -Meet with Simmons
```

## Using a calendar fi le that contains an include statement

A calendar fi le that contains an include statement might look like the following:

```
#include </tmp/out> 1/21 -Annual review 1/21 -Weekly project meeting 1/22 *Meet with Harrison in Dallas* Doctor's appointment -1/23 1/23 -Vinh's wedding
```

To run the calendar command, type:

```
calendar
```

If today is Wednesday, January 21, the calendar command displays the following:

```
Jan.21 Goodbye party for David Jan.22 Stockholder meeting in New York 1/21 -Annual review 1/21 -Weekly project meeting 1/22 *Meet with Harrison in Dallas*
```

The results of the calendar command indicate the /tmp/out fi le contained the following lines:

```
Jan.21 Goodbye party for David Jan.22 Stockholder meeting in New York
```

## Factoring a Number

You can factor numbers with the factor command.

When called without specifying a value for the Number parameter, the factor command waits for you to enter a positive number less than 1E14 (100,000,000,000,000). It then writes the prime factors of that number to standard output. It displays each factor in order and the proper number of times if the same factor is used more than once. To exit, enter 0 (zero) or any non-numeric character.

When called with an argument, the factor command determines the prime factors of the Number parameter, writes the results to standard output, and exits.

The following is an example of how to calculate factors:

1. To calculate the prime factors of the number 123, type:
2. Press Enter. The following displays:

```
factor 123
```

```
123 3 41
```

## Locating a command by keyword

You can display the man page sections that contain any of the given Keywords in their title by using the apropos command.

The apropos command considers each word separately is not case-sensitive. Words that are part of other words are also displayed. For example, when looking for the word compile , the apropos command also fi nds all instances of the word compiler .

Note: The database containing the keywords is /usr/share/man/whatis , which must fi rst be generated with the catman -w command.

The apropos command is equivalent to using the man command with the -k option.

For example, to fi nd the manual sections that contain the word password in their titles, run the following command:

```
apropos password
```

## Processes

A program or command that is actually running on the computer is referred to as a process .

Processes exist in parent-child hierarchies. A process started by a program or command is a parent process ; a child process is the product of the parent process. A parent process can have several child processes, but a child process can have only one parent.

The system assigns a process identi fi cation number (PID number) to each process when it starts. If you start the same program several times, it will have a different PID number each time.

When a process is started on a system, the process uses a part of the available system resources. When more than one process is running, a scheduler that is built into the operating system gives each process

a share of the computer's time, based on established priorities. These priorities can be changed by using the nice or renice commands.

Note: To change a process priority to a higher one, you must have root user authority. All users can lower priorities on a process they start by using the nice command or on a process they have already started, by using the renice command.

The following list describes the types of processes:

## Foreground and background processes

Processes that require a user to start them or to interact with them are called foreground processes . Processes that are run independently of a user are referred to as background processes . Programs and commands run as foreground processes by default. To run a process in the background, place an ampersand (&amp;) at the end of the command name that you use to start the process.

## Daemon processes

Daemons are processes that run unattended. They are constantly in the background and are available at all times. Daemons are usually started when the system starts, and they run until the system stops. A daemon process typically performs system services and is available at all times to more than one task or user. Daemon processes are started by the root user or root shell and can be stopped only by the root user. For example, the qdaemon process provides access to system resources such as printers. Another common daemon is the sendmail daemon.

## Zombie processes

A zombie process is a dead process that is no longer executing but is still recognized in the process table (in other words, it has a PID number). It has no other system space allocated to it. Zombie processes have been killed or have exited and continue to exist in the process table until the parent process dies or the system is shut down and restarted. Zombie processes display as &lt;defunct&gt; when listed by the ps command.

## Process startup

You start a foreground process from a display station by either entering a program name or command name at the system prompt.

After a foreground process has started, the process interacts with you at your display station until it is complete. No other interaction (for example, entering another command) can take place at the display station until the process is fi nished or you halt it.

A single user can run more than one process at a time, up to a default maximum of 40 processes per user.

## Starting a process in the foreground

To start a process in the foreground, enter the name of the command with the appropriate parameters and flags:

- $ CommandName

## Starting a process in the background

To run a process in the background, type the name of the command with the appropriate parameters and flags, followed by an ampersand ( &amp; ):

- $ CommandName &amp;

When a process is running in the background, you can perform additional tasks by entering other commands at your display station.

Generally, background processes are most useful for commands that take a long time to run. However, because they increase the total amount of work the processor is doing, background processes can slow down the rest of the system.

Most processes direct their output to standard output, even when they run in the background. Unless redirected, standard output goes to the display device. Because the output from a background

process can interfere with your other work on the system, it is usually good practice to redirect the output of a background process to a fi le or a printer. You can then look at the output whenever you are ready.

Note: Under certain circumstances, a process might generate its output in a different sequence when run in the background than when run in the foreground. Programmers might want to use the fflush subroutine to ensure that output occurs in the correct order regardless of whether the process runs in foreground or background.

While a background process is running, you can check its status with the ps command.

## Command to check the process status (ps command)

Any time the system is running, processes are also running. You can use the ps command to fi nd out which processes are running and display information about those processes.

The ps command has several flags that enable you to specify which processes to list and what information to display about each process.

To show all processes running on your system, at the prompt, type the following:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The system displays information similar to the following:

```

In the previous example, the process ID for the ps -ef command is 19402 . Its parent process ID is 16260 , the /bin/ksh command.

If the listing is very long, the top portion scrolls off the screen. To display the listing one page (screen) at a time, pipe the ps command to the pg command. At the prompt, type the following:

```
ps -ef | pg To display status information of all processes running on your system, at the prompt, type the following: ps gv
```

This form of the command lists a number of statistics for each active process. Output from this command looks similar to the following:

## Setting the initial priority of a process (nice command)

You can set the initial priority of a process to a value lower than the base scheduling priority.

To set the initial priority of a process to a value lower than the base scheduling priority, use the nice command to start the process.

Note: To run a process at a higher priority than the base scheduling priority, you must have root user authority.

To set the initial priority of a process, type the following:

```
nice -n Number CommandString
```

where Number is in the range of 0 to 39, with 39 being the lowest priority. The nice value is the decimal value of the system-scheduling priority of a process. The higher the number, the lower the priority. If you use zero, the process will run at its base scheduling priority. CommandString is the command and flags and parameters you want to run.

You can also use the smit nice command to perform this task.

## Changing the priority of a running process (renice command)

You can change the scheduling priority of a running process to a value lower or higher than the base scheduling priority by using the renice command from the command line. This command changes the nice value of a process.

Note: To run a process at a higher priority or to change the priority for a process that you did not start, you must have root user authority.

To change the priority of a running process, type the following:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Priority is a number in the range of -20 to 20. The higher the number, the lower the priority. If you use zero, the process will run at its base scheduling priority. ProcessID is the PID for which you want to change the priority.

You can also use the smit renice command to perform this task.

## Foreground process cancellation

If you start a foreground process and then decide that you do not want it to fi nish, you can cancel it by pressing INTERRUPT. This is usually Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Backspace.

Note: INTERRUPT (Ctrl-C) does not cancel background processes. To cancel a background process, you must use the kill command.

Most simple commands run so quickly that they fi nish before you have time to cancel them. The examples in this section, therefore, use a command that takes more than a few seconds to run: find / -type f . This command displays the path names for all fi les on your system. You do not need to study the find command in order to complete this section; it is used here simply to demonstrate how to work with processes.

In the following example, the find command starts a process. After the process runs for a few seconds, you can cancel it by pressing the INTERRUPT key:

```
$ find / -type f /usr/sbin/acct/lastlogin /usr/sbin/acct/prctmp /usr/sbin/acct/prdaily /usr/sbin/acct/runacct /usr/sbin/acct/sdisk /usr/sbin/acct/shutacct INTERRUPT (Ctrl-C) $ _
```

The system returns the prompt to the screen. Now you can enter another command.

## Keyboard command to stop a foreground process

It is possible for a process to be stopped but not have its process ID (PID) removed from the process table. You can stop a foreground process by pressing Ctrl-Z from the keyboard.

Note: Ctrl-Z works in the Korn shell ( ksh ) and C shell ( csh ), but not in the Bourne shell ( bsh ).

## Restarting a stopped process

This procedure describes how to restart a process that has been stopped with a Ctrl-Z.

Note: Ctrl-Z works in the Korn shell ( ksh ) and C shell ( csh ), but not in the Bourne shell ( bsh ). To restart a stopped process, you must either be the user who started the process or have root user authority.

1. To show all the processes running or stopped but not those killed on your system, type the following:

```
ps -ef
```

You might want to pipe this command through a grep command to restrict the list to those processes most likely to be the one you want to restart. For example, if you want to restart a vi session, you could type the following:

```
ps -ef | grep vi
```

This command would display only those lines from the ps command output that contained the word vi . The output would look something like this:

```
UID PID PPID C STIME TTY TIME COMMAND
```

```
root 1234 13682 0 00:59:53 -0:01 vi test root 14277 13682 1 01:00:34 -0:00 grep vi
```

2. In the ps command output, fi nd the process you want to restart and note its PID number. In the example, the PID is 1234 .
3. To send the CONTINUE signal to the stopped process, type the following:

```
kill -19 1234
```

Substitute the PID of your process for the 1234 . The -19 indicates the CONTINUE signal. This command restarts the process in the background. If the process can run in the background, you are fi nished with the procedure. If the process must run in the foreground (as a vi session would), you must proceed with the next step.

4. To bring the process in to the foreground, type the following:

```
fg 1234
```

Once again, substitute the PID of your process for the 1234 . Your process should now be running in the foreground. (You are now in your vi edit session).

## Scheduling a process for later operation

You can set up a process as a batch process to run in the background at a scheduled time.

The at and smit commands let you enter the names of commands to be run at a later time and allow you to specify when the commands should be run.

Note: The /var/adm/cron/at.allow and /var/adm/cron/at.deny fi les control whether you can use the at command. A person with root user authority can create, edit, or delete these fi les. Entries in these fi les are user login names with one name to a line. The following is an example of an at.allow fi le:

```
root nick dee sarah
```

If the at.allow fi le exists, only users whose login names are listed in it can use the at command. A system administrator can explicitly stop a user from using the at command by listing the user's login name, in the at.deny fi le. If only the at.deny fi le exists, any user whose name does not appear in the fi le can use the at command.

You cannot use the at command if any one of the following is true:

- The at.allow fi le and the at.deny fi le do not exist (allows root user only).
- The at.allow fi le exists but the user's login name is not listed in it.
- The at.deny fi le exists and the user's login name is listed in it.

If the at.allow fi le does not exist and the at.deny fi le does not exist or is empty, only someone with root user authority can submit a job with the at command.

The at command syntax allows you to specify a date string, a time and day string, or an increment string for when you want the process to run. It also allows you to specify which shell or queue to use. The following examples show some typical uses of the command.

For example, if your login name is joyce and you have a script named WorkReport that you want to run at midnight, do the following:

1. Type the time you want the program to start running:
2. Type the names of the programs to run, pressing Enter after each name. After typing the surname, press the end-offi le character (Ctrl-D) to signal the end of the list.

```
at midnight
```

```
WorkReport^D
```

After you press Ctrl-D, the system displays information similar to the following:

```
job joyce.741502800.a at Fri Jul 6 00:00:00 CDT 2002.
```

The program WorkReport is given the job number joyce.741502800.a and will run at midnight, July 6.

3. To list the programs you have sent to be run later, type the following:

at -l

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
joyce.741502800.a Fri Jul 6 00:00:00 CDT 2002
```

See the at command for the complete syntax.

Use the -l flag with the at command or with the atq command to list all scheduled processes.

## Removing a process from the schedule

You can remove a scheduled process with the at command using the -r flag.

## Listing all scheduled processes (at or atq command)

Use the -l flag with the at command or with the atq command to list all scheduled processes.

Both commands give the same output; however, the atq command can order the processes in the same amount of time that the at command is issued and displays only the number of processes in the queue.

You can list all scheduled processes in the following ways:

- With the at command from the command line
- With the atq command

## at command

To list the scheduled processes, type the following:

```
at -l
```

This command lists all the scheduled processes in your queue. If you are a root user, this command lists all the scheduled processes for all users. For complete details of the syntax, see the at command.

## atq command

See the following examples on how to use the atq command:

- To list all scheduled processes in the queue, type the following:

atq

- If you are a root user, you can list the scheduled processes in a particular user's queue by typing:

atq UserName

- To list the number of scheduled processes in the queue, type the following:

```
atq -n
```

## Removing a background process (kill command)

If INTERRUPT does not halt your foreground process or if you decide, after starting a background process, that you do not want the process to fi nish, you can cancel the process with the kill command.

Before you can cancel a process using the kill command, you must know its PID number. The general format for the kill command is as follows:

```
kill ProcessID
```

## Note:

- To remove a process, you must have root user authority or be the user who started the process. The default signal to a process from the kill command is -15 (SIGTERM).
- To remove a zombie process, you must remove its parent process.
1. Use the ps command to determine the process ID of the process you want to remove. You might want to pipe this command through a grep command to list only the process you want. For example, if you want the process ID of a vi session, you could type the following:
2. In the following example, you issue the find command to run in the background. You then decide to cancel the process. Issue the ps command to list the PID numbers.

```
ps -l | grep vi
```

```
$ find / -type f > dir.paths & [1] 21593 $ ps PID TTY TIME COMMAND 1627 pts3 0:00 ps 5461 pts3 0:00 ksh 17565 pts3 0:00 -ksh 21593 pts3 0:00 find / -type f $ kill 21593 $ ps PID TTY TIME COMMAND 1627 pts3 0:00 ps 5461 pts3 0:00 ksh 17565 pts3 0:00 -ksh [1] + Terminated 21593 find / -type f > dir.paths
```

```
&
```

The command kill 21593 ends the background find process, and the second ps command returns no status information about PID 21593. The system does not display the termination message until you enter your next command, unless that command is cd .

The kill command lets you cancel background processes. You might want to do this if you realize that you have mistakenly put a process in the background or that a process is taking too long to run.

The kill command can also used in smit by typing:

```
smit kill
```

## Managing system hang

System hang management allows users to run mission-critical applications continuously while improving application availability. System hang detection alerts the system administrator of possible problems and then allows the administrator to log in as root or to reboot the system to resolve the problem.

## shconf command

The shconf command is invoked when System Hang Detection is enabled. The shconf command con fi gures which events are surveyed and what actions are to be taken if such events occur. You can specify any of the following actions, the priority level to check, the time out while no process or thread executes at a lower or equal priority, the terminal device for the warning action, and the getty command action:

- Log an error in errlog fi le
- Display a warning message on the system console (alphanumeric console) or on a speci fi ed TTY
- Reboot the system
- Give a special getty to allow the user to log in as root and launch commands
- Launch a command

For the Launch a command and Give a special getty options, system hang detection launches the special getty command or the speci fi ed command at the highest priority. The special getty command prints a warning message that it is a recovering getty running at priority 0. The following table captures the various actions and the associated default parameters for priority hang detection. Only one action is enabled for each type of detection.

| Option                       | Enablement   |   Priority |   Timeout (seconds) |
|------------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Log an error in errlog fi le | disabled     |         60 |                 120 |

| Option                    | Enablement   |   Priority |   Timeout (seconds) |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Display a warning message | disabled     |         60 |                 120 |
| Give a recovering getty   | enabled      |         60 |                 120 |
| Launch a command          | disabled     |         60 |                 120 |
| Reboot the system         | disabled     |         39 |                 300 |

Note: When Launch a recovering getty on a console is enabled, the shconf command adds the -u flag to the getty command in the inittab that is associated with the console login.

For lost IO detection, you can set the time out value and enable the following actions:

| Option                    | Enablement   |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Display a warning message | disabled     |
| Reboot the system         | disabled     |

## shdaemon daemon

The shdaemon daemon is a process that is launched by init and runs at priority 0 (zero). It is in charge of handling system hang detection by retrieving con fi guration information, initiating working structures, and starting detection times set by the user.

## Related concepts

## Priority hang detection

AIX can detect system hang conditions and try to recover from such situations, based on user-de fi ned actions.

## Lost I/O hang detection

AIX can detect system hang conditions and try to recover from such situations, based on user-de fi ned actions.

## Con fi guring system hang detection

You can manage the system hang detection con fi guration from the SMIT management tool.

SMIT menu options allow you to enable or disable the detection mechanism, display the current state of the feature, and change or show the current con fi guration. The fast paths for system hang detection menus are:

## smit shd

Manage System Hang Detection

## smit shstatus

System Hang Detection Status

## smit shpriocfg

Change/Show Characteristics of Priority Problem Detection

## smit shreset

Restore Default Priority Problem Con fi guration

## smit shliocfg

Change/Show Characteristics of Lost I/O Detection

## smit shlioreset

Restore Default Lost I/O Detection Con fi guration

You can also manage system hang detection using the shconf command.

## Priority hang detection

AIX can detect system hang conditions and try to recover from such situations, based on user-de fi ned actions.

All processes (also known as threads) run at a priority. This priority is numerically inverted in the range 0-126. Zero is highest priority and 126 is the lowest priority. The default priority for all threads is 60. The priority of a process can be lowered by any user with the nice command. Anyone with root authority can also raise a process's priority.

The kernel scheduler always picks the highest priority runnable thread to put on a CPU. It is therefore possible for a suf fi cient number of high priority threads to completely tie up the machine such that low priority threads can never run. If the running threads are at a priority higher than the default of 60, this can lock out all normal shells and logins to the point where the system appears hung.

The System Hang Detection feature provides a mechanism to detect this situation and allow the system administrator a means to recover. This feature is implemented as a daemon ( shdaemon ) that runs at the highest process priority. This daemon queries the kernel for the lowest priority thread run over a speci fi ed interval. If the priority is above a con fi gured threshold, the daemon can take one of several actions. Each of these actions can be independently enabled, and each can be con fi gured to trigger at any priority and over any time interval. The actions and their defaults are:

|    | Action                         | Default Enabled   |   Default Priority |   Default Timeout | Default Device   |
|----|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1) | Log an error                   | no                |                 60 |                 2 |                  |
| 2) | Console message                | no                |                 60 |                 2 | /dev/console     |
| 3) | High priority login shell      | yes               |                 60 |                 2 | /dev/tty0        |
| 4) | Run a command at high priority | no                |                 60 |                 2 |                  |
| 5) | Crash and reboot               | no                |                 39 |                 5 |                  |

## Managing system hang

System hang management allows users to run mission-critical applications continuously while improving application availability. System hang detection alerts the system administrator of possible problems and then allows the administrator to log in as root or to reboot the system to resolve the problem.

## Lost I/O hang detection

AIX can detect system hang conditions and try to recover from such situations, based on user-de fi ned actions.

Because of I/O errors, the I/O path can become blocked and further I/O on that path is affected. In these circumstances it is essential that the operating system alert the user and execute user de fi ned actions. As part of the Lost I/O detection and noti fi cation, the shdaemon , with the help of the Logical Volume Manager, monitors the I/O buffers over a period of time and checks whether any I/O is pending for too long a period of time. If the wait time exceeds the threshold wait time de fi ned by the shconf fi le, a lost I/O is detected and further actions are taken. The information about the lost I/O is documented in the error log. Also based on the settings in the shconf fi le, the system might be rebooted to recover from the lost I/O situation.

For lost I/O detection, you can set the time out value and also enable the following actions:

| Action           | Default Enabled   | Default Device   |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Console message  | no                | /dev/console     |
| Crash and reboot | no                | -                |

## Process management

The process is the entity that the operating system uses to control the use of system resources. Threads can control processor-time consumption, but most system management tools still require you to refer to the process in which a thread is running, rather than to the thread itself.

Tools are available to:

- Observe the creation, cancellation, identity, and resource consumption of processes
- The ps command is used to report process IDs, users, CPU-time consumption, and other attributes.
- The who -u command reports the shell process ID of logged-on users.
- The svmon command is used to report process real-memory consumption.
- The acct command mechanism writes records at process termination summarizing the process's resource use.
- Control the priority level at which a process contends for the CPU.
- The nice command causes a command to be run with a speci fi ed process priority.
- The renice command changes the priority of a given process.
- Terminate processes that are out of control.
- The kill command sends a termination signal to one or more processes.

## Process monitoring

You, as the system administrator, can manage processes.

The ps command is the primary tool for observing the processes in the system. Most of the flags of the ps command fall into one of two categories:

- Flags that specify which types of processes to include in the output
- Flags that specify which attributes of those processes are to be displayed

The most widely useful variants of ps for system-management purposes are:

Item

## Description

ps -ef

Lists all nonkernel processes, with the userid, process ID, recent CPU usage, total CPU usage, and the command that started the process (including its parameters).

ps -fu UserID

Lists all of the processes owned by UserID , with the process ID, recent CPU usage, total CPU usage, and the command that started the process (including its parameters).

To identify the current heaviest users of CPU time, you could enter:

```
ps -ef | egrep -v "STIME|$LOGNAME" | sort +3 -r | head -n 15
```

This command lists, in descending order, the 15 most CPU-intensive processes other than those owned by you.

For more specialized uses, the following two tables are intended to simplify the task of choosing ps flags by summarizing the effects of the flags.

If ps is given with no flags or with a process-specifying flag that begins with a minus sign, the columns displayed are those shown for Default1. If the command is given with a process-specifying flag that does not begin with minus, Default2 columns are displayed. The -u or -U flag is both a process-specifying and column-selecting flag.

The following are brief descriptions of the contents of the columns:

Item

Description

PID

Process ID

TTY

Terminal or pseudo-terminal associated with the process

TIME

Cumulative CPU time consumed, in minutes and seconds

CMD

Command the process is running

USER

Login name of the user to whom the process belongs

Item

Description

UID

Numeric user ID of the user to whom the process belongs

PPID

ID of the parent process of this process

C

Recently used CPU time

STIME

Time the process started, if less than 24 hours. Otherwise the date the process is started

F

Eight-character hexadecimal value describing the flags associated with the process (see the detailed description of the ps command)

S/STAT

Status of the process (see the detailed description of the ps command)

PRI

Current priority value of the process

NI/NICE

Nice value for the process

ADDR

Segment number of the process stack

SIZE

( -v flag) The virtual size of the data section of the process (in kilobytes)

SZ

( -l and l flags) The size in kilobytes of the core image of the process.

WCHAN

Event on which the process is waiting

RSS

Sum of the numbers of working-segment and code-segment pages in memory times 4

SSIZ

Size of the kernel stack

%CPU

Percentage of time since the process started that it was using the CPU

%MEM

Nominally, the percentage of real memory being used by the process, this measure does not correlate with any other memory statistics

PGIN

Number of page ins caused by page faults. Since all I/O is classi fi ed as page faults, this is basically a measure of I/O volume

LIM

Always xx

TSIZ

Size of the text section of the executable fi le

TRS

Number of code-segment pages times 4

Environment

Value of all the environment variables for the process

## Process priority alteration

Basically, if you have identi fi ed a process that is using too much CPU time, you can reduce its effective priority by increasing its nice value with the renice command.

For example:

renice +5 ProcID

The nice value of the ProcID 's would increase process from the normal 20 of a foreground process to 25. You must have root authority to reset the process ProcID 's nice value to 20. Type:

renice -5 ProcID

## Process termination

Normally, you use the kill command to end a process.

The kill command sends a signal to the designated process. Depending on the type of signal and the nature of the program that is running in the process, the process might end or might keep running. The signals you send are:

## Item Description

SIGTERM

(signal 15) is a request to the program to terminate. If the program has a signal handler for SIGTERM that does not actually terminate the application, this kill may have no effect. This is the default signal sent by kill .

SIGKILL

(signal 9) is a directive to kill the process immediately. This signal cannot be caught or ignored.

It is typically better to issue SIGTERM rather than SIGKILL. If the program has a handler for SIGTERM, it can clean up and terminate in an orderly fashion. Type:

kill -term ProcessID

(The -term could be omitted.) If the process does not respond to the SIGTERM, type:

kill -kill ProcessID

You might notice occasional defunct processes, also called zombies , in your process table. These processes are no longer executing, have no system space allocated, but still retain their PID number. You can recognize a zombie process in the process table because it displays &lt;defunct&gt; in the CMD column. For example:

| UID   |   PID |   PPID |   C | STIME     | TTY   | TIME   | CMD       |
|-------|-------|--------|-----|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| lee   | 22392 |  20682 |   0 | Jul 10 10 | -     | 0:05   | xclock    |
| lee   | 22536 |  21188 |   0 | Jul       | pts/0 | 0:00   | /bin/ksh  |
| lee   | 22918 |  24334 |   0 | Jul       | pts/1 | 0:00   | /bin/ksh  |
| lee   | 23526 |  22536 |  22 | 10        |       | 0:00   | <defunct> |
| lee   | 24334 |  20682 |   0 | Jul 10    | ?     | 0:00   | aixterm   |
| lee   | 24700 |      1 |   0 | Jul 16    | ?     | 0:00   | aixterm   |
| root  | 25394 |  26792 |   2 | Jul 16    | pts/2 | 0:00   | ksh       |
| lee   | 26070 |  24700 |   0 | Jul 16    | pts/3 | 0:00   | /bin/ksh  |
| lee   | 26792 |  20082 |   0 | Jul 10    | pts/2 | 0:00   | /bin/ksh  |
| root  | 27024 |  25394 |   2 | 17:10:44  | pts/2 | 0:00   | ps -ef    |

Zombie processes continue to exist in the process table until the parent process dies or the system is shut down and restarted. In the example shown above, the parent process (PPID) is the ksh command. When the Korn shell is exited, the defunct process is removed from the process table.

Sometimes a number of these defunct processes collect in your process table because an application has forked several child processes and has not exited. If this becomes a problem, the simplest solution is to modify the application so its sigaction subroutine ignores the SIGCHLD signal.

## Binding or unbinding a process

You can bind a process to a processor or unbind a previously bound process.

You must have root user authority to bind or unbind a process you do not own.

On multiprocessor systems, you can bind a process to a processor or unbind a previously bound process from:

- SMIT

- command line

Note: While binding a process to a processor might lead to improved performance for the bound process (by decreasing hardware-cache misses), overuse of this facility could cause individual processors to become overloaded while other processors are under used. The resulting bottlenecks could reduce overall throughput and performance. During normal operations, it is better to let the operating system assign processes to processors automatically, distributing system load across all processors. Bind only those processes that you know can bene fi t from being run on a single processor.

Binding or Unbinding a Process Tasks

| Task                | SMIT Fast Path   | Command or File   |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Binding a Process   | smit bindproc    | bindprocessor -q  |
| Unbinding a Process | smit ubindproc   | bindprocessor -u  |

## Fixes for stalled or unwanted processes

Stalled or unwanted processes can cause problems with your terminal. Some problems produce messages on your screen that give information about possible causes.

To perform the following procedures, you must have either a second terminal, a modem, or a network login. If you do not have any of these, fi x the terminal problem by rebooting your machine.

Choose the appropriate procedure for fi xing your terminal problem:

Freeing a terminal taken over by processes

You can stop stalled or unwanted process.

Identify and stop stalled or unwanted processes by doing the following:

1. Determine the active processes running on the screen by typing the following ps command:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The ps command shows the process status. The -e flag writes information about all processes (except kernel processes), and the f flag generates a full listing of processes including what the command name and parameters were when the process was created. The pg command limits output to a single page at a time, so information does not quickly scroll off the screen.

Suspicious processes include system or user processes that use up excessive amounts of a system resource such as CPU or disk space. System processes such as sendmail , routed , and lpd frequently become runaways. Use the ps -u command to check CPU usage.

2. Determine who is running processes on this machine by using the who command:

who

The who command displays information about all users currently on this system, such as login name, workstation name, date, and time of login.

3. Determine if you need to stop, suspend, or change the priority of a user process.

Note: You must have root authority to stop processes other than your own. If you terminate or change the priority of a user process, contact the process owner and explain what you have done.

- Stop the process using the kill command. For example:

kill 1883

The kill command sends a signal to a running process. To stop a process, specify the process ID (PID), which is 1883 in this example. Use the ps command to determine the PID number of commands.

- Suspend the process and run it in the background by using the ampersand (&amp;). For example:

```
/u/bin1/prog1 &
```

The &amp; signals that you want this process to run in the background. In a background process, the shell does not wait for the command to complete before returning the shell prompt. When a process requires more than a few seconds to complete, run the command in background by typing an &amp; at the end of the command line. Jobs running in the background appear in the normal ps command.

- Change the priority of the processes that have taken over by using the following renice command:

```
renice 20 1883
```

The renice command alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes. The higher the number, the lower the priority with 20 being the lowest priority.

In the previous example, renice reschedules process number 1883 to the lowest priority. It will run when there is a small amount of unused processor time available.

## Responding to screen messages

Use this procedure to respond to and recover from screen messages.

1. Make sure the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly. Use either of the following methods to check the DISPLAY environment:
- Use the setsenv command to display the environment variables.

setsenv

The setsenv command displays the protected state environment when you logged in.

Determine if the DISPLAY variable has been set. In the following example, the DISPLAY variable does not appear, which indicates that the DISPLAY variable is not set to a speci fi c value.

```
SYSENVIRON: NAME=casey TTY=/dev/pts/5 LOGNAME=casey LOGIN=casey
```

## OR

- Change the value of the DISPLAY variable. For example, to set it to the machine named bastet and terminal 0, enter:

```
DISPLAY=bastet:0 export DISPLAY
```

If not speci fi cally set, the DISPLAY environment variable defaults to unix:0 (the console). The value of the variable is in the format name : number where name is the host name of a particular machine, and number is the X server number on the named system.

2. Reset the terminal to its defaults using the following stty command:

```
stty sane
```

The stty sane command restores the 'sanity' of the terminal drivers. The command outputs an appropriate terminal resetting code from the /etc/termcap fi le (or /usr/share/lib/terminfo if available).

3. If the Return key does not work correctly, reset it by typing:

```
^J stty sane ^J
```

The ^J represents the Ctrl-J key sequence.

## Running multiple queues using environment variables RT\_MPC and RT\_GRQ

The use of multiple queues increases the processor af fi nity of threads, but there is a special situation where you might want to counteract this effect.

When there is only one run queue, a thread that has been awakened (the waking thread) by another running thread (the waker thread) would normally be able to use the CPU immediately on which the waker thread was running. With multiple run queues, the waking thread may be on the run queue of another CPU which cannot notice the waking thread until the next scheduling decision. This may result in up to a 10 ms delay.

This is similar to scenarios in earlier releases of this operating system which might have occurred using the bindprocessor option. If all CPUs are constantly busy, and there are a number of interdependent threads waking up, there are two options available.

- The fi rst option, which uses one run queue, is to set the environment variable RT\_GRQ=ON which forces unbound selected threads to be dispatched off the global run queue.
- Alternatively, users can choose the real time kernel option (type the command bosdebug -R on and then bosboot ) and the RT\_MPC=ON environment variable for selected processes. It is essential to maintain a performance log of your systems to closely monitor the impact of any tuning you attempt.

## System accounting

The system accounting utility allows you to collect and report on individual and group use of various system resources.

This accounting information can be used to bill users for the system resources they utilize, and to monitor selected aspects of the system operation. To assist with billing, the accounting system provides the resource-usage totals de fi ned by members of the adm group, and, if the chargefee command is included, factors in the billing fee.

The accounting system also provides data to assess the adequacy of current resource assignments, set resource limits and quotas, forecast future needs, and order supplies for printers and other devices.

The following information should help you understand how to implement the accounting utility in your system.

## Accounting data reports

After the various types of accounting data are collected, the records are processed and converted into reports.

Accounting commands automatically convert records into scienti fi c notation when numbers become large. A number is represented in scienti fi c notation in the following format:

Base e+ Exp

## Base eExp

which is the number equal to the Base number multiplied by 10 to the + Exp or -Exp power. For example, the scienti fi c notation 1.345e+9 is equal to 1.345x10 9 , or 1,345,000,000. And the scienti fi c notation 1.345e-9 is equal to 1.345x10 -9 or, 0.000000001345.

## Related concepts

## Process accounting data

The Accounting system collects data on resource usage for each process as it runs.

## Daily accounting reports

To generate a daily report, use the runacct command.

This command summarizes data into an ASCII fi le named /var/adm/acct/sum(x)/rprt MMDD . MMDD speci fi es the month and day the report is run. The report covers the following:

- Daily report

- Daily Usage report
- Daily Command Summary
- Monthly Total Command Summary
- Last Login

## Daily report

Daily accounting reports contain data on connect-time, processes, disk usage, printer usage, and fees to charge.

The acctmerg command merges raw accounting data on connect-time, processes, disk usage, printer usage, and fees to charge into daily reports. Called by the runacct command as part of its daily operation, the acctmerg command produces the following:

## /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/dacct

An intermediate report that is produced when one of the input fi les is full.

## /var/adm/acct/sum(x)/tacct

A cumulative total report in tacct format. This fi le is used by the monacct command to produce the ASCII monthly summary.

The acctmerg command can convert records between ASCII and binary formats and merge records from different sources into a single record for each user. For more information about the acctmerg command, see acctmerg .

The fi rst line of the Daily report begins with the start and fi nish times for the data collected in the report, a list of system-level events including any existing shutdowns, reboots, and run-level changes. The total duration is also listed indicating the total number of minutes included within the accounting period (usually 1440 minutes, if the report is run every 24 hours). The report contains the following information:

Item

Description

LINE

Console, tty, or pty In use

MINUTES

Total number of minutes the line was in use

PERCENT

Percentage of time in the accounting period that the line was in use

# SESS

Number of new login sessions started

# ON

Same as # SESS

# OFF

Number of logouts plus interrupts made on the line

## Daily Usage accounting report

The Daily Usage report is a summarized report of system usage per user ID during the accounting period.

Some fi elds are divided into prime and non-prime time, as de fi ned by the accounting administrator in the /usr/lib/acct/holidays directory. The report contains the following information:

| Item                   | Description                                                                                             |

| # OF PROCS             | Total number of processes belonging to this user                                                        |

Item

# OF SESS

## Description

Number of distinct login sessions for this user

# DISK SAMPLES

Number of times disk samples were run during the accounting period. If no DISK BLOCKS are owned, the value will be zero

## Daily Command Summary accounting report

The Daily Command Summary report shows each command executed during the accounting period, with one line per each unique command name.

The table is sorted by TOTAL KCOREMIN (described below), with the fi rst line including the total information for all commands. The data listed for each command is cumulative for all executions of the command during the accounting period. The columns in this table include the following information:

Item

## Description

COMMAND NAME

NUMBER CMDS

Number of times the command executed

TOTAL KCOREMIN

Total memory used by running the command, in kilobyte-minutes

TOTAL CPU-MIN

Total CPU time used by the command in minutes

TOTAL REAL-MIN

Total real time elapsed for the command in minutes

MEAN SIZE-K

Mean size of memory used by the command per CPU minute

MEAN CPU-MIN

Mean numbr of CPU minutes per execution of the command

HOG FACTOR

## Monthly Total Command Summary accounting report

The Monthly Total Command Summary, created by the monacct command, provides information about all commands executed since the previous monthly report.

The fi elds and information mean the same as those in the Daily Command Summary.

## Last login

The Last Login report displays two fi elds for each user ID. The fi rst fi eld is YY-MM-DD and indicates the most recent login for the speci fi ed user. The second fi eld is the name of the user account.

A date fi eld of 00-00-00 indicates that the user ID has never logged in.

## Accounting report summary

You can generate a report that summarizes raw accounting data.

To summarize raw accounting data, use the sa command. This command reads the raw accounting data, usually collected in the /var/adm/pacct fi le, and the current usage summary data in the /var/adm/ savacct fi le, if summary data exists. It combines this information into a new usage summary report and purges the raw data fi le to make room for further data collection.

## Prerequisites

The sa command requires an input fi le of raw accounting data such as the pacct fi le (process accounting fi le). To collect raw accounting data, you must have an accounting system set up and running.

## Procedure

The purpose of the sa command is to summarize process accounting information and to display or store that information. The simplest use of the command displays a list of statistics about every process that has run during the life of the pacct fi le being read. To produce such a list, type:

/usr/sbin/sa

To summarize the accounting information and merge it into the summary fi le, type:

/usr/sbin/sa -s

The sa command offers many additional flags that specify how the accounting information is processed and displayed. See the sa command description for more information.

## Monthly report

You can generate a Monthly accounting report.

Called by the cron daemon, the monacct command produces the following:

Item

## Description

/var/adm/acct/fiscal

A periodic summary report produced from the /var/adm/acct/sum/ tacct report by the monacct command. The monacct command can be con fi gured to run monthly or at the end of a fi scal period.

## Connect-time reports

Accounting records include login, logout, system-shutdown, and lastlogin records.

The runacct command calls two commands, acctcon1 and acctcon2 , to process the login, logout, and system-shutdown records that collect in the /var/adm/wtmp fi le. The acctcon1 command converts these records into session records and writes them to the /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/lineuse fi le. The acctcon2 command then converts the session records into a total accounting record, /var/adm/ logacct , that the acctmerg command adds to daily reports. For information about these commands, see runacct , acctcon1 , and acctcon2 .

If you run the acctcon1 command from the command line, you must include the -l flag to produce the line-use report, /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/lineuse . To produce an overall session report for the accounting period, /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/reboots , use the acctcon1 command with the -o flag.

The lastlogin command produces a report that gives the last date on which each user logged in. For information about the lastlogin command, see lastlogin .

## Related concepts

Connect-time accounting data

Connect-time data is collected by the init command and the login command.

## Disk-usage accounting data

Much accounting information is collected as the resources are consumed. The dodisk command, run as speci fi ed by the cron daemon, periodically writes disk-usage records for each user to the /var/adm/ acct/nite(x)/dacct fi le.

## Disk-usage accounting report

The disk-usage records collected in the /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/dacct fi le are merged into the daily accounting reports by the acctmerg command.

For information about the acctmerg command, see acctmerg .

## Printer-Usage accounting report

The ASCII record in the /var/adm/qacct fi le can be converted to a total accounting record to be added to the daily report by the acctmerg command.

For information about the acctmerg command, see acctmerg .

## Related concepts

Printer-usage accounting data

The collection of printer-usage data is a cooperative effort between the enq command and the queuing daemon.

## Fee accounting report

If you used the chargefee command to charge users for services such as fi le restores, consulting, or materials, an ASCII total accounting record is written in the /var/adm/fee fi le. This fi le is added to the daily reports by the acctmerg command.

For information about the chargefee and acctmerg commands, see chargefee and acctmerg .

## Related concepts

Fee accounting data

You can produce an ASCII total accounting record in the /var/adm/fee fi le.

## Fiscal accounting reports

The Fiscal Accounting Reports generally collected monthly by using the monacct command.

The report is stored in /var/adm/acct/fiscal(x)/fiscrptMM where MM is the month that the monacct command was executed. This report includes information similar to the daily reports summarized for the entire month.

## Accounting system activity reports

You can generate a report that shows Accounting system activity.

To generate a report on system activity, use the prtacct command. This command reads the information in a total accounting fi le ( tacct fi le format) and produces formatted output. Total accounting fi les include the daily reports on connect time, process time, disk usage, and printer usage.

## Prerequisites

The prtacct command requires an input fi le in the tacct fi le format. This implies that you have an accounting system set up and running or that you have run the accounting system in the past.

## Procedure

Generate a report on system activity by entering:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Speci fi cation is a comma-separated list of fi eld numbers or ranges used by the acctmerg command. The optional -v flag produces verbose output where floating-point numbers are displayed in higher precision notation. Heading is the title you want to appear on the report and is optional. File is the full path name of the total accounting fi le to use for input. You can specify more than one fi le.

## Greater than eight character username support

In order to maintain backwards compatibility with all scripts, long username support is not enabled by default within accounting. Instead, all user IDs are truncated to the fi rst eight characters.

In order to enable long username support, most commands have been given the additional -X flag, which allows them to accept and output greater than eight-character user IDs (in both ASCII and binary

formats). In addition, when long username support is enabled, commands and scripts will process fi les in the /var/adm/acct/sumx , /var/adm/acct/nitex , and /var/adm/acct/fiscalx directories, instead of using /var/adm/acct/sum , /var/adm/acct/nite , and /var/adm/acct/fiscal .

## Accounting commands

The accounting commands function several different ways.

Some commands:

- Collect data or produce reports for a speci fi c type of accounting: connect-time, process, disk usage, printer usage, or command usage.
- Call other commands. For example, the runacct command, which is usually run automatically by the cron daemon, calls many of the commands that collect and process accounting data and prepare reports. To obtain automatic accounting, you must fi rst con fi gure the cron daemon to run the runacct command. See the crontab command for more information about how to con fi gure the cron daemon to submit commands at regularly scheduled intervals. For information about these commands, see runacct , cron daemon, and crontab .
- Perform maintenance functions and ensure the integrity of active data fi les.
- Enable members of the adm group to perform occasional tasks, such as displaying speci fi c records, by entering a command at the keyboard.
- Enable a user to display speci fi c information. There is only one user command, the acctcom command, which displays process accounting summaries.

## Commands that run automatically

Several commands automatically collect accounting data.

Several commands usually run by the cron daemon automatically collect accounting data. These commands are:

## runacct

Handles the main daily accounting procedure. Normally initiated by the cron daemon during nonprime hours, the runacct command calls several other accounting commands to process the active data fi les and produce command and resource usage summaries, sorted by user name. It also calls the acctmerg command to produce daily summary report fi les, and the ckpacct command to maintain the integrity of the active data fi les.

## ckpacct

Handles pacct fi le size. It is advantageous to have several smaller pacct fi les if you must restart the runacct procedure after a failure in processing these records. The ckpacct command checks the size of the /var/adm/pacct active data fi le, and if the fi le is larger than 500 blocks, the command invokes the turnacct switch command to turn off process accounting temporarily. The data is transferred to a new pacct fi le, /var/adm/pacct x . ( x is an integer that increases each time a new pacct fi le is created.) If the number of free disk blocks falls below 500, the ckpacct command calls the turnacct off command to turn off process accounting.

## dodisk

Calls the acctdisk command and either the diskusg command or the acctdusg command to write disk-usage records to the /var/adm/acct/nite/dacct fi le. This data is later merged into the daily reports.

## dodisk

Calls the acctdisk command and either the diskusg command or the acctdusg command to write disk-usage records to the /var/adm/acct/nite/dacct fi le. This data is later merged into the daily reports.

## monacct

Produces a periodic summary from daily reports.

## sa1

Collects and stores binary data in the /var/adm/sa/sa dd fi le, where dd is the day of the month.

## sa2

Writes a daily report in the /var/adm/sa/sa dd fi le, where dd is the day of the month. The command removes reports from the /var/adm/sa/sa dd fi le that have been there longer than one week.

Other commands are run automatically by procedures other than the cron daemon:

## startup

When added to the /etc/rc fi le, the startup command initiates startup procedures for the accounting system.

## shutacct

Records the time accounting was turned off by calling the acctwtmp command to write a line to /var/adm/wtmp fi le. It then calls the turnacct off command to turn off process accounting.

## Keyboard commands

A member of the adm group can enter the following commands from the keyboard.

## ac

Prints connect-time records. This command is provided for compatibility with Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) systems.

## acctcom

Displays process accounting summaries. This command is also available to users.

## acctcon1

Displays connect-time summaries. Either the -l flag or the -o flag must be used.

## accton

Turns process accounting on and off.

## chargefee

Charges the user a predetermined fee for units of work performed. The charges are added to the daily report by the acctmerg command.

## fwtmp

Converts fi les between binary and ASCII formats.

## last

Displays information about previous logins. This command is provided for compatibility with BSD systems.

## lastcomm

Displays information about the last commands that were executed. This command is provided for compatibility with BSD systems.

## lastlogin

Displays the time each user last logged in.

## pac

Prepares printer/plotter accounting records. This command is provided for compatibility with BSD systems.

## prctmp

Displays a session record.

## prtacct

Displays total accounting fi les.

## sa

Summarizes raw accounting information to help manage large volumes of accounting information. This command is provided for compatibility with BSD systems.

## sadc

Reports on various local system actions, such as buffer usage, disk and tape I/O activity, TTY device activity counters, and fi le access counters.

## sar

Writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The sar command reports only on local activities.

## time

Prints real time, user time, and system time required to run a command.

## timex

Reports in seconds the elapsed time, user time, and run time.

## Related concepts

System data collection and reporting

You can set up the system to automatically collect data and generate reports.

## Accounting fi les

The two main accounting directories are the /usr/sbin/acct directory, where all the C language programs and shell procedures needed to run the accounting system are stored, and the /var/adm directory, which contains the data, report and summary fi les.

The accounting data fi les belong to members of the adm group, and all active data fi les (such as wtmp and pacct ) reside in the adm home directory /var/adm .

## Accounting data fi les

The following fi les are in the /var/adm directory.

## Item

## Description

/var/adm/diskdiag

Diagnostic output during the running of disk accounting programs

/var/adm/dtmp

Output from the acctdusg command

/var/adm/fee

Output from the chargefee command, in ASCII tacct records

/var/adm/pacct

Active process accounting fi le

/var/adm/wtmp

Active process accounting fi le

/var/adm/Spacct . mmdd

Process accounting fi les for mmdd during the execution of the runacct command.

## Accounting report and summary fi les

Some subdirectories are needed before you enable the Accounting system.

Report and summary fi les reside in a /var/adm/acct subdirectory. You must create the following subdirectories before the Accounting system is enabled.

## /var/adm/acct/nite(x)

Contains fi les that the runacct command reuses daily

## /var/adm/acct/sum(x)

Contains the cumulative summary fi les that the runacct command updates daily

## /var/adm/acct/fiscal(x)

Contains the monthly summary fi les that the monacct command creates.

## Related tasks

Setting up an accounting system

You can set up an accounting system.

## Starting the runacct command for accounting

You can start the runacct command.

## Prerequisites

1. You must have the accounting system installed.
2. You must have root user or adm group authority.

## Notes:

1. If you call the runacct command with no parameters, the command assumes that this is the fi rst time that the command has been run today. Therefore, you need to include the mmdd parameter when you restart the runacct program, so that the month and day are correct. If you do not specify a state, the runacct program reads the /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/statefile fi le to determine the entry point for processing. To override the /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/statefile fi le, specify the desired state on the command line.
2. When you perform the following task, you might need to use the full path name /usr/sbin/acct/ runacct rather than the simple command name, runacct .

## Procedure

To start the runacct command, type the following:

```
nohup runacct 2> \ /var/adm/acct/nite/accterr &
```

This entry causes the command to ignore all INTR and QUIT signals while it performs background processing. It redirects all standard error output to the /var/adm/acct/nite/accterr fi le.

## Restarting the runacct command for Accounting

If the runacct command is unsuccessful, you can restart it.

The prerequisites for this procedure are:

- You must have the accounting system installed.
- You must have root user or adm group authority.

Note: The most common reason why the runacct command can fail are because:

- The system goes down.
- The /usr fi le system runs out of space.
- The /var/adm/wtmp fi le has records with inconsistent date stamps.

If the runacct command is unsuccessful, do the following:

1. Check the /var/adm/acct/nite(x)/active mmdd fi le for error messages.
2. If both the active fi le and lock fi les exist in acct/nite , check the accterr fi le, where error messages are redirected when the cron daemon calls the runacct command.
3. Perform any actions needed to eliminate errors.
4. Restart the runacct command.
5. To restart the runacct command for a speci fi c date, type the following:

```
nohup runacct 0601 2>> \ /var/adm/acct/nite/accterr &
```

This restarts the runacct program for June 1 ( 0601 ). The runacct program reads the /var/adm/ acct/nite/statefile fi le to fi nd out with which state to begin. All standard error output is appended to the /var/adm/acct/nite/accterr fi le.

6. To restart the runacct program at a speci fi ed state, for example, the MERGE state, type the following:

```
nohup runacct 0601 MERGE 2>> \ /var/adm/acct/nite/accterr &
```

## runacct command fi les

## Administering system accounting

There are multiple tasks you can complete for system accounting. These tasks include setting up an accounting system, showing CPU usage, and displaying accounting processes.

## Setting up an accounting system

You can set up an accounting system.

You must have root authority to complete this procedure.

The information below is an overview of the steps you must take to set up an accounting system. Refer to the commands and fi les noted in these steps for more speci fi c information.

1. Use the nulladm command to ensure that each fi le has the correct access permission: read (r) and write (w) permission for the fi le owner and group and read (r) permission for others by typing:

/usr/sbin/acct/nulladm wtmp pacct

This provides access to the pacct and wtmp fi les.

2. Update the /etc/acct/holidays fi le to include the hours you designate as prime time and to reflect your holiday schedule for the year.

Note: Comment lines can appear anywhere in the fi le as long as the fi rst character in the line is an asterisk (*).

- a. To de fi ne prime time, fi ll in the fi elds on the fi rst data line (the fi rst line that is not a comment), using a 24-hour clock. This line consists of three 4-digit fi elds, in the following order:
- i) Current year
3. ii) Beginning of prime time ( hhmm )
4. iii) End of prime time ( hhmm )

Leading blanks are ignored. You can enter midnight as either 0000 or 2400.

For example, to specify the year 2000, with prime time beginning at 8:00 a.m. and ending at 5:00 p.m., enter:

2000 0800 1700

- b. To de fi ne the company holidays for the yea, fi ll in the next data line. Each line contains four fi elds, in the following order:
- i) Day of the year
3. ii) Month
4. iii) Day of the month
5. iv) Description of holiday

The day-of-the-year fi eld contains the number of the day on which the holiday falls and must be a number from 1 through 365 (366 on leap year). For example, February 1st is day 32. The other three fi elds are for information only and are treated as comments.

A two-line example follows:

```
1 Jan 1 New Year's Day 332 Nov 28 Thanksgiving Day
```

3. Turn on process accounting by adding the following line to the /etc/rc fi le or by deleting the comment symbol (#) in front of the line if it exists:

```
/usr/bin/su -adm -c /usr/sbin/acct/startup
```

The startup procedure records the time that accounting was turned on and cleans up the previous day's accounting fi les.

4. Identify each fi le system you want included in disk accounting by adding the following line to the stanza for the fi le system in the /etc/filesystems fi le:
5. Specify the data fi le to use for printer data by adding the following line to the queue stanza in the /etc/qconfig fi le:
6. As the adm user, create a /var/adm/acct/nite , a /var/adm/acct/fiscal , a and /var/adm/ acct/sum directory to collect daily and fi scal period records:

```
account = true
```

```
acctfile = /var/adm/qacct
```

```
su -adm cd /var/adm/acct mkdir nite fiscal sum exit
```

For long usernames, use the following commands instead:

```
su -adm cd /var/adm/acct mkdir nitex fiscalx sumx exit
```

7. Set daily accounting procedures to run automatically by editing the /var/spool/cron/ crontabs/adm fi le to include the dodisk , ckpacct , and runacct commands. For example:

```
0 2 * * 4 /usr/sbin/acct/dodisk 5 * * * * /usr/sbin/acct/ckpacct 0 4 * * 1-6 /usr/sbin/acct/runacct 2>/var/adm/acct/nite/accterr
```

For long usernames, add the following lines instead:

```
0 2 * * 4 /usr/sbin/acct/dodisk -X 5 * * * * /usr/sbin/acct/ckpacct 0 4 * * 1-6 /usr/sbin/acct/runacct -X 2>/var/adm/acct/nitex/accterr
```

The fi rst line starts disk accounting at 2:00 a.m. ( 0 2 ) each Thursday (4). The second line starts a check of the integrity of the active data fi les at 5 minutes past each hour ( 5 * ) every day ( * ). The third line runs most accounting procedures and processes active data fi les at 4:00 a.m. ( 0 4 ) every Monday through Saturday ( 1-6 ). If these times do not fi t the hours your system operates, adjust your entries.

Note: You must have root user authority to edit the /var/spool/cron/crontabs/adm fi le.

8. Set the monthly accounting summary to run automatically by including the monacct command in the /var/spool/cron/crontabs/adm fi le. For example, type:

15 5 1 * * /usr/sbin/acct/monacct

For long usernames, add the following line instead:

```
15 5 1 * * /usr/sbin/acct/monacct -X
```

Be sure to schedule this procedure early enough to fi nish the report. This example starts the procedure at 5:15 a.m. on the fi rst day of each month.

9. To submit the edited cron fi le, type:

```
crontab /var/spool/cron/crontabs/adm
```

## Displaying Accounting system activity

You can display formatted information about system activity with the sar command.

To display system activity statistics, the sadc command must be running.

Note: The typical method of running the sadc command is to place an entry for the sa1 command in the root crontab fi le. The sa1 command is a shell-procedure variant of the sadc command designed to work with the cron daemon.

To display basic system-activity information, type:

```
sar 2 6
```

where the fi rst number is the number of seconds between sampling intervals and the second number is the number of intervals to display. The output of this command looks something like this:

| arthurd 2 3 000166021000   | arthurd 2 3 000166021000   | arthurd 2 3 000166021000   | arthurd 2 3 000166021000   | 05/28/92   | 05/28/92   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------|------------|
| 14:03:40                   | %usr                       | %sys                       | %wio                       | %idle      |            |
| 14:03:42                   | 4                          | 9                          | 0                          | 88         |            |
| 14:03:43                   | 1                          | 10                         | 0                          | 89         |            |
| 14:03:44                   | 1                          | 11                         | 0                          | 88         |            |

| 14:03:45   | 1 11 3      |
|------------|-------------|
| 14:03:46   | 0 88 9 0 88 |
| 14:03:47   | 2 10 0 88   |
| Average    | 2 10 0 88   |

The sar command also offers a number of flags for displaying an extensive array of system statistics. To see all available statistics, use the -A flag. For a list of the available statistics and the flags for displaying them, see the sar command.

Note: To have a daily system activity report written to /var/adm/sa/sa dd , include an entry in the root crontab fi le for the sa2 command. The sa2 command is a shell procedure variant for the sar command designed to work with the cron daemon.

## Showing Accounting system activity while running a command

You can display formatted information about system activity while a particular command is running.

The -o and -p flags of the timex command require that system accounting be turned on.

You can use the time and timex commands to display formatted information about system activity while a particular command is running.

To display the elapsed time, user time, and system execution time for a particular command, type:

```
time CommandName OR timex CommandName
```

To display the total system activity (all the data items reported by the sar command) during the execution of a particular command, type:

```
timex -s CommandName
```

The timex command has two additional flags. The -o flag reports the total number of blocks read or written by the command and all of its children. The -p flag lists all of the process accounting records for a command and all of its children.

## Displaying the process time of active Accounting processes

You can display the process time for active processes.

The acctcom command reads input in the total accounting record form ( acct fi le format). This implies that you have process accounting turned on or that you have run process accounting in the past.

The ps command offers a number of flags to tailor the information displayed.

To produce a full list of all active processes except kernel processes, type:

```
ps -ef
```

You can also display a list of all processes associated with terminals. To do this, type:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Both of these usages display a number of columns for each process, including the current CPU time for the process in minutes and seconds.

## Displaying the process time of fi nished Accounting processes

You can display the process time of fi nished processes.

The acctcom command reads input in the total accounting record form ( acct fi le format). This implies that you have process accounting turned on or that you have run process accounting in the past.

The process accounting functions are turned on with the startup command, which is typically started at system initialization with a call in the /etc/rc fi le. When the process accounting functions are running, a record is written to /var/adm/pacct (a total accounting record fi le) for every fi nished process that includes the start and stop time for the process. You can display the process time information from a pacct fi le with the acctcom command. This command has a number of flags that allow flexibility in specifying which processes to display.

For example, to see all processes that ran for a minimum number of CPU seconds or longer, use the -O flag, type:

```
acctcom -O 2
```

This displays records for every process that ran for at least 2 seconds. If you do not specify an input fi le, the acctcom command reads input from the /var/adm/pacct directory.

## Showing the CPU usage for each accounting process

You can display formatted reports about the CPU usage by user with the acctprc1 command.

The acctprc1 command requires input in the total accounting record form ( acct fi le format). This implies that you have process accounting turned on or that you have run process accounting in the past.

To produce a formatted report of CPU usage by process, type:

```
acctprc1 </var/adm/pacct
```

## Showing the CPU accounting usage for each user

You can display a formatted report about the CPU usage by user with a combination of the acctprc1 and prtacct commands.

The acctprc1, acctprc2, or accton Command command requires input in the total accounting record form ( acct fi le format). This implies that you have process accounting turned on or that you have run process accounting in the past.

To show the CPU usage for each user, perform the following steps:

1. Produce an output fi le of CPU usage by process by typing:

```
acctprc1 </var/adm/pacct >out.file
```

The /var/adm/pacct fi le is the default output for process accounting records. You might want to specify an archive pacct fi le instead.

2. Produce a binary total accounting record fi le from the output of the previous step by typing:

```
acctprc2 <out.file >/var/adm/acct/nite/daytacct
```

Note: The daytacct fi le is merged with other total accounting records by the acctmerg command to produce the daily summary record, /var/adm/acct/sum(x)/tacct .

3. Use the Showing the CPU accounting usage for each user command to display a formatted report of CPU usage summarized by the user by typing:

```
prtacct </var/adm/acct/nite/daytacct
```

## Displaying connect time usage for accounting

You can display the connect time of all users, of individual users, and by individual login with the ac command.

The ac command extracts login information from the /var/adm/wtmp fi le, so this fi le must exist. If the fi le has not been created, the following error message is returned:

```
No /var/adm/wtmp
```

If the fi le becomes too full, additional wtmp fi les are created; you can display connect-time information from these fi les by specifying them with the -w flag. For more information about the ac command, see ac .

To display the total connect time for all users, type:

```
/usr/sbin/acct/ac
```

This command displays a single decimal number that is the sum total connect time, in minutes, for all users who have logged in during the life of the current wtmp fi le.

To display the total connect time for one or more particular users, type:

```
/usr/sbin/acct/ac User1 User2 ...
```

This command displays a single decimal number that is the sum total connect time, in minutes, for the user or users you speci fi ed for any logins during the life of the current wtmp fi le.

To display the connect time by individual user plus the total connect time, type:

```
/usr/sbin/acct/ac -p User1 User2 ...
```

This command displays as a decimal number for each user speci fi ed equal to the total connect time, in minutes, for that user during the life of the current wtmp fi le. It also displays a decimal number that is the sum total connect time for all the users speci fi ed. If no user is speci fi ed in the command, the list includes all users who have logged in during the life of the wtmp fi le.

## Displaying disk space utilization for accounting

You can display disk space utilization information with the acctmerg command.

To display disk space utilization information, the acctmerg command requires input from a dacct fi le (disk accounting). The collection of disk-usage accounting records is performed by the dodisk command.

To display disk space utilization information, type:

```
acctmerg -a1 -2,13 -h </var/adm/acct/nite(x)/dacct
```

This command displays disk accounting records, which include the number of 1 KB blocks utilized by each user.

Note: The acctmerg command always reads from standard input and can read up to nine additional fi les. If you are not piping input to the command, you must redirect input from one fi le; the rest of the fi les can be speci fi ed without redirection.

## Displaying printer or plotter usage accounting records

You can display printer or plotter usage accounting records with the pac command.

- To collect printer usage information, you must have an accounting system set up and running. See 'Setting up an accounting system' on page 161 for guidelines.
- The printer or plotter for which you want accounting records must have an acctfile= clause in the printer stanza of the /etc/qconfig fi le. The fi le speci fi ed in the acctfile= clause must grant read and write permissions to the root user or printq group.
- If the -s flag of the pac command is speci fi ed, the command rewrites the summary fi le name by appending \_sum to the path name speci fi ed by the acctfile= clause in the /etc/qconfig fi le. This fi le must exist and grant read and write permissions to the root user or printq group.

To display printer usage information for all users of a particular printer, type:

```
/usr/sbin/pac -PPrinter
```

If you do not specify a printer, the default printer is named by the PRINTER environment variable. If the PRINTER variable is not de fi ned, the default is lp0 .

To display printer usage information for particular users of a particular printer, type:

```
/usr/sbin/pac -PPrinter User1 User2 ...
```

The pac command offers other flags for controlling what information gets displayed.

## Updating the holidays fi le

The Holidays fi le is out of date after the last holiday listed has passed or the year has changed. You can update the Holidays fi le.

The acctcon1 command (started from the runacct command) sends mail to the root and adm accounts when the /usr/lib/acct/holidays fi le gets out of date.

Update the out-of-date Holidays fi le by editing the /var/adm/acct/holidays fi le to differentiate between prime and nonprime time.

Prime time is assumed to be the period when your system is most active, such as workdays. Saturdays and Sundays are always nonprime times for the accounting system, as are any holidays that you list.

The holidays fi le contains three types of entries: comments, the year and prime-time period, and a list of holidays as in the following example:

| * *            | Prime/Non-Prime Time   | Table for Accounting System Non-Prime   |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| * Curr * Year  | Prime                  |                                         |
| 1992 *         | Start 0830             | Start 1700                              |
| * Day * Year * | Calendar Date          | Company Holiday                         |
| * 1 * 20       | Jan 1 Jan 20           | New Year's Day Martin Luther King Day   |
| * 46           | Feb 15                 | President's Day                         |
| * 143          | May 28                 | Memorial Day                            |
| * 186          | Jul 3                  | 4th of July                             |
| * 248 *        | Sep 7 Nov 24           | Labor Day Thanksgiving                  |
| *              | Nov 25                 | Friday after                            |
| 329 330 359    |                        |                                         |
| *              | Dec 24                 | Christmas Eve                           |
| * 360          | Dec 25                 | Christmas Day                           |
| * 361          | Dec 26                 | Day after Christmas                     |

The fi rst noncomment line must specify the current year (as four digits) and the beginning and end of prime time, also as four digits each. The concept of prime and nonprime time only affects the way that the accounting programs process the accounting records.

If the list of holidays is too long, the acctcon1 command generates an error, and you will need to shorten your list. You are safe with 20 or fewer holidays. If you want to add more holidays, just edit the holidays fi le each month.

## Collecting accounting data

Once you have setup system accounting you will want to start collecting and processing the different type of accounting data.

## System data collection and reporting

You can set up the system to automatically collect data and generate reports.

For data to be collected automatically, a member of the adm group must have been setup as an accounting system. The accounting system setup enables the cron daemon to run the commands that generate data on:

- The amount of time each user spends logged in to the system
- Usage of the processing unit, memory, and I/O resources
- The amount of disk space occupied by each user's fi les
- Usage of printers and plotters
- The number of times a speci fi c command is given.

The system writes a record of each session and process after they are completed. These records are converted into total accounting ( tacct ) records arranged by user and merged into a daily report. Periodically, the daily reports are combined to produce totals for the de fi ned fi scal period. Methods for collecting and reporting the data and the various accounting commands and fi les are discussed in the following sections.

Although most of the accounting data is collected and processed automatically, a member of the adm group can enter certain commands from the keyboard to obtain speci fi c information.

## Related tasks

## Keyboard commands

A member of the adm group can enter the following commands from the keyboard.

## Connect-time accounting data

Connect-time data is collected by the init command and the login command.

When you log in, the login program writes a record in the /etc/utmp fi le. This record includes your user name, the date and time of the login, and the login port. Commands, such as who , use this fi le to fi nd out which users are logged into the various display stations. If the /var/adm/wtmp connect-time accounting fi le exists, the login command adds a copy of this login record to it. For information about the init and login commands, see init and login .

When your login program ends (normally when you log out), the init command records the end of the session by writing another record in the /var/adm/wtmp fi le. Logout records differ from login records in that they have a blank user name. Both the login and logout records have the form described in the utmp.h fi le. For information about the utmp.h fi le, see utmp.h .

The acctwtmp command also writes special entries in the /var/adm/wtmp fi le concerning system shutdowns and startups.

## Related concepts

## Connect-time reports

Accounting records include login, logout, system-shutdown, and lastlogin records.

## Process accounting data

The Accounting system collects data on resource usage for each process as it runs.

This data includes:

- The user and group numbers under which the process runs
- The fi rst eight characters of the name of the command
- A 64-bit numeric key representing the Workload Manager class that the process belongs to
- The elapsed time and processor time used by the process
- Memory use
- The number of characters transferred
- The number of disk blocks read or written on behalf of the process

The accton command records these data in a speci fi ed fi le, usually the /var/adm/pacct fi le. For more information about the accton command, see accton .

Related commands are the startup command, the shutacct command, the dodisk command, the ckpacct command, and the turnacct command. For information about these commands, see startup , shutacct , dodisk , ckpacct , and turnacct .

## Related concepts

Accounting data reports

After the various types of accounting data are collected, the records are processed and converted into reports.

## Process accounting reports

Two commands process the billing-related data that was collected in the /var/adm/pacct or other speci fi ed fi le.

The acctprc1 command translates the user ID into a user name and writes ASCII records containing the chargeable items (prime and non-prime CPU time, mean memory size, and I/O data). The acctprc2 command transforms these records into total accounting records that are added to daily reports by the acctmerg command. For more information about the acctmerg command, see acctmerg .

Process accounting data also provides information that you can use to monitor system resource usage. The acctcms command summarizes resource use by command name. This provides information on how many times each command was run, how much processor time and memory was used, and how intensely the resources were used (also known as the hog factor ). The acctcms command produces long-term statistics on system utilization, providing information on total system usage and the frequency with which commands are used. For more information about the acctcms command, see acctcms .

The acctcom command handles the same data as the acctcms command, but provides detailed information about each process. You can display all process accounting records or select records of particular interest. Selection criteria include the load imposed by the process, the time period when the process ended, the name of the command, the user or group that invoked the process, the name of the WLM class the proces belonged to, and the port at which the process ran. Unlike other accounting commands, acctcom can be run by all users. For more information about the acctcom command, see acctcom .

## Disk-usage accounting data

Much accounting information is collected as the resources are consumed. The dodisk command, run as speci fi ed by the cron daemon, periodically writes disk-usage records for each user to the /var/adm/ acct/nite(x)/dacct fi le.

To accomplish this, the dodisk command calls other commands. Depending upon the thoroughness of the accounting search, the diskusg command or the acctdusg command can be used to collect data.

The acctdisk command is used to write a total accounting record. The total accounting record, in turn, is used by the acctmerg command to prepare the daily accounting report.

The dodisk command charges a user for the links to fi les found in the user's login directory and evenly divides the charge for each fi le between the links. This distributes the cost of using a fi le over all who use it and removes the charges from users when they relinquish access to a fi le. For more information about the dodisk command and cron daemon, see dodisk and cron .

## Connect-time reports

Accounting records include login, logout, system-shutdown, and lastlogin records.

## Printer-usage accounting data

The collection of printer-usage data is a cooperative effort between the enq command and the queuing daemon.

The enq command enqueues the user name, job number, and the name of the fi le to be printed. After the fi le is printed, the qdaemon command writes an ASCII record to a fi le, usually the /var/adm/qacct fi le, containing the user name, user number, and the number of pages printed. You can sort these records and convert them to total accounting records. For more information about these commands, see enq and qdaemon .

The ASCII record in the /var/adm/qacct fi le can be converted to a total accounting record to be added to the daily report by the acctmerg command.

## Fee accounting data

You can produce an ASCII total accounting record in the /var/adm/fee fi le.

You can enter the chargefee command to produce an ASCII total accounting record in the /var/adm/fee fi le. This fi le will be added to daily reports by the acctmerg command.

For information about the chargefee and acctmerg commands, see chargefee and acctmerg .

Fee accounting report

If you used the chargefee command to charge users for services such as fi le restores, consulting, or materials, an ASCII total accounting record is written in the /var/adm/fee fi le. This fi le is added to the daily reports by the acctmerg command.

## Troubleshooting system accounting

Use these troubleshooting methods to tackle some of the basic problems that may occur when using system accounting. If the troubleshooting information does not address your problem, contact your service representative.

## Fixing tacct errors

If you are using the accounting system to charge users for system resources, the integrity of the /var/adm/acct/sum/tacct fi le is quite important. Occasionally, mysterious tacct records appear that contain negative numbers, duplicate user numbers, or a user number of 65,535. You can fi x these problems.

You must have root user or adm group authority.

To patch a tacct fi le, perform the following steps:

1. Move to the /var/adm/acct/sum directory by typing:
2. Use the prtacct command to check the total accounting fi le, tacctprev , by typing:

```
cd /var/adm/acct/sum
```

```
prtacct tacctprev
```

The prtacct command formats and displays the tacctprev fi le so that you can check connect time, process time, disk usage, and printer usage.

3. If the tacctprev fi le looks correct, change the latest tacct . mmdd fi le from a binary fi le to an ASCII fi le. In the following example, the acctmerg command converts the tacct. mmdd fi le to an ASCII fi le named tacct.new :

```
acctmerg -v < tacct. mmdd > tacct.new
```

Note: The acctmerg command with the -a flag also produces ASCII output. The -v flag produces more precise notation for floating-point numbers.

The acctmerg command is used to merge the intermediate accounting record reports into a cumulative total report ( tacct ). This cumulative total is the source from which the monacct command produces the ASCII monthly summary report. Since the monacct command procedure removes all the tacct. mmdd fi les, you recreate the tacct fi le by merging these fi les.

4. Edit the tacct.new fi le to remove the bad records and write duplicate user number records to another fi le by typing:

```
acctmerg -i < tacct.new > tacct.mmdd 5. Create the tacct fi le again by typing: acctmerg tacctprev < tacct. mmdd > tacct
```

## Fixing wtmp errors

The /var/adm/wtmp , or "who temp" fi le, might cause problems in the day-to-day operation of the accounting system. You can fi x wtmp errors.

You must have root user or adm group authority to perform this procedure.

When the date is changed and the system is in multiuser mode, date change records are written to the /var/adm/wtmp fi le. When a date change is encountered, the wtmpfix command adjusts the time stamps in the wtmp records. Some combinations of date changes and system restarts may slip past the wtmpfix command and cause the acctcon1 command to fail and the runacct command to send mail to the root and adm accounts listing incorrect dates.

To fi x wtmp errors, perform the following procedure:

1. Move to the /var/adm/acct/nite directory by typing:

```
cd /var/adm/acct/nite 2. Convert the binary wtmp fi le to an ASCII fi le that you can edit by typing: fwtmp < wtmp. mmdd > wtmp.new The fwtmp command converts wtmp from binary to ASCII. 3. Edit the ASCII wtmp.new fi le to delete damaged records or all records from the beginning of the fi le up to the needed date change by typing: vi wtmp.new 4. Convert the ASCII wtmp.new fi le back to binary format by typing: fwtmp -ic < wtmp.new > wtmp. mmdd 5. If the wtmp fi le is beyond repair, use the nulladm command to create an empty wtmp fi le. This prevents any charges in the connect time.
```

```
nulladm wtmp
```

The nulladm command creates the fi le speci fi ed with read and write permissions for the fi le owner and group, and read permissions for other users. It ensures that the fi le owner and group are adm .

## Fixing incorrect Accounting fi le permissions

To use the Accounting system, fi le ownership and permissions must be correct.

You must have root user or adm group authority to perform this procedure.

The adm administrative account owns the accounting command and scripts, except for /var/adm/ acct/accton which is owned by root.

To fi x incorrect Accounting fi le permissions, perform the following procedure:

1. To check fi le permissions using the ls command, type:
2. Adjust fi le permissions with the chown command, if necessary.

```
ls -l /var/adm/acct -rws--x--1 adm adm 14628 Mar 19 08:11 /var/adm/acct/fiscal -rws--x--1 adm adm 14628 Mar 19 08:11 /var/adm/acct/nite -rws--x--1 adm adm 14628 Mar 19 08:11 /var/adm/acct/sum
```

The permissions are 755 (all permissions for owner and read and execute permissions for all others). Also, the directory itself should be write-protected from others.

For example:

- a. Move to the /var/adm/acct directory by typing:
- b. Change the ownership for the sum , nite , and fiscal directories to adm group authority by typing:

```
cd /var/adm/acct
```

```
chown adm sum/* nite/* fiscal/*
```

To prevent tampering by users trying to avoid charges, deny write permission for others on these fi les. Change the accton command group owner to adm , and permissions to 710 , that is, no permissions for others. Processes owned by adm can execute the accton command, but ordinary users cannot.

3. The /var/adm/wtmp fi le must also be owned by adm . If /var/adm/wtmp is owned by root, you will see the following message during startup:

```
/var/adm/acct/startup: /var/adm/wtmp: Permission denied
```

```
To correct the ownership of /var/adm/wtmp , change ownership to the adm group by typing the following command: chown adm /var/adm/wtmp
```

## Fixing Accounting errors

You can correct date and time-stamp inconsistencies.

You must have root user or adm group authority to perform this procedure.

Processing the /var/adm/wtmp fi le might produce some warnings mailed to root. The wtmp fi le contains information collected by /etc/init and /bin/login and is used by accounting scripts primarily for calculating connect time (the length of time a user is logged in). Unfortunately, date changes confuse the program that processes the wtmp fi le. As a result, the runacct command sends mail to root and adm complaining of any errors after a date change since the last time accounting was run.

1. Determine if you received any errors.

The acctcon1 command outputs error messages that are mailed to adm and root by the runacct command.

For example, if the acctcon1 command stumbles after a date change and fails to collect connect times, adm might get mail like the following mail message:

```
Mon Jan 6 11:58:40 CST 1992 acctcon1: bad times: old: Tue Jan 7 00:57:14 1992 new: Mon Jan 6 11:57:59 1992 acctcon1: bad times: old: Tue Jan 7 00:57:14 1992 new: Mon Jan 6 11:57:59 1992 acctcon1: bad times: old: Tue Jan 7 00:57:14 1992 new: Mon Jan 6 11:57:59 1992
```

2. Adjust the wtmp fi le by typing:

```
/usr/sbin/acct/wtmpfix wtmp
```

The wtmpfix command examines the wtmp fi le for date and time-stamp inconsistencies and corrects problems that could make acctcon1 fail. However, some date changes slip by wtmpfix .

3. Run accounting right before shutdown or immediately after startup.

Using the runacct command at these times minimizes the number of entries with bad times. The runacct command continues to send mail to the root and adm accounts, until you edit the runacct script, fi nd the WTMPFIX section, and comment out the line where the fi le log gets mailed to the root and adm accounts.

Accounting errors encountered when running the runacct command You might encounter errors when running the runacct command.

Note: You must have root user or adm group authority to run the runacct command.

The runacct command processes fi les that are often very large. The procedure involves several passes through certain fi les and consumes considerable system resources while it is taking place. Since the runacct command consumes considerable resources, it is normally run early in the morning when it can take over the machine and not disturb anyone.

The runacct command is a script divided into different stages. The stages allow you to restart the command where it stopped, without having to rerun the entire script.

When the runacct encounters problems, it sends error messages to different destinations depending on where the error occurred. Usually it sends a date and a message to the console directing you to look in the active MMDD fi le (such as active0621 for June 21st) which is in the /usr/adm/acct/nite directory. When the runacct command aborts, it moves the entire active fi le to active MMDD and appends a message describing the problem.

Review the following error message tables for errors that you might encounter when running the runacct command.

## Note:

- The abbreviation MMDD stands for the month and day, such as 0102 for January 2. For example, an unrecoverable error during the CONNECT1 process on January 2 creates the fi le active0102 containing the error message.
- The abbreviation "SE message" stands for the standard error message such as:

```
********* ACCT ERRORS : see active0102 *********
```

## System Resource Controller

The System Resource Controller (SRC) provides a set of commands and subroutines to make it easier for the system manager and programmer to create and control subsystems.

A subsystem is any program or process or set of programs or processes that is usually capable of operating independently or with a controlling system. A subsystem is designed as a unit to provide a designated function.

The SRC was designed to minimize the need for operator intervention. It provides a mechanism to control subsystem processes using a common command line and the C interface. This mechanism includes the following:

- Consistent user interface for start, stop, and status inquiries

- Logging of the abnormal termination of subsystems
- Noti fi cation program called at the abnormal system termination of related processes
- Tracing of a subsystem, a group of subsystems, or a subserver
- Support for control of operations on a remote system
- Refreshing of a subsystem (such as after a con fi guration data change).

The SRC is useful if you want a common way to start, stop, and collect status information on processes.

## Related concepts

Introduction to AIX for BSD system managers

The following are tips to help Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) system managers get started managing AIX.

## Subsystem components

The following are the properties and components of a subsystem.

A subsystem can have one or more of the following properties:

- Is known to the system by name
- Requires a more complex execution environment than a subroutine or nonprivileged program
- Includes application programs and libraries as well as subsystem code
- Controls resources that can be started and stopped by name
- Requires noti fi cation if a related process is unsuccessful to perform cleanup or to recover resources
- Requires more operational control than a simple daemon process
- Needs to be controlled by a remote operator
- Implements subservers to manage speci fi c resources
- Does not put itself in the background.

A few subsystem examples are ypserv, ntsd, qdaemon, inetd, syslogd, and sendmail.

Note: See each speci fi c subsystem for details of its SRC capabilities.

Use the lssrc -a command to list active and inactive subsystems on your system.

The following de fi nes subsystem groups and subservers:

## Subsystem Group

A subsystem group is a group of any speci fi ed subsystems. Grouping subsystems together allows the control of several subsystems at one time. A few subsystem group examples are TCP/IP, SNA Services, Network Information System (NIS), and Network File Systems (NFS).

## Subserver

A subserver is a program or process that belongs to a subsystem. A subsystem can have multiple subservers and is responsible for starting, stopping, and providing status of subservers. Subservers can be de fi ned only for a subsystem with a communication type of IPC message queues and sockets. Subsystems using signal communications do not support subservers.

Subservers are started when their parent subsystems are started. If you try to start a subserver and its parent subsystem is not active, the startsrc command starts the subsystem as well.

## SRC hierarchy

The System Resource Controller hierarchy begins with the operating system followed by a subsystem group (such as tcpip ), which contains a subsystem (such as the inetd daemon), which in turn can own several subservers (such as the ftp daemon and the finger command).

## SRC administration commands

You can administer SRC from the command line.

The SRC administration commands are:

tracesoff command

Turns off tracing of a subsystem, a group of subsystems, or a subserver

lssrc command

Gets status on a subsystem.

## Starting the System Resource Controller

The System Resource Controller (SRC) is started during system initialization with a record for the /usr/ sbin/srcmstr daemon in the /etc/inittab fi le.

The following are the prerequisites for starting the SRC:

- Reading and writing the /etc/inittab fi le requires root user authority.
- The mkitab command requires root user authority.
- The srcmstr daemon record must exist in the /etc/inittab fi le.

The default /etc/inittab fi le already contains such a record, so this procedure might be unnecessary. You can also start the SRC from the command line, a pro fi le, or a shell script, but there are several reasons for starting it during initialization:

- Starting the SRC from the /etc/inittab fi le allows the init command to restart the SRC if it stops for any reason.
- The SRC is designed to simplify and reduce the amount of operator intervention required to control subsystems. Starting the SRC from any source other than the /etc/inittab fi le is counterproductive to that goal.
- The default /etc/inittab fi le contains a record for starting the print scheduling subsystem ( qdaemon ) with the startsrc command. Typical installations have other subsystems started with startsrc commands in the /etc/inittab fi le as well. Because the srcmstr command requires the SRC be running, removing the srcmstr daemon from the /etc/inittab fi le causes these startsrc commands to fail.

Note: This procedure is necessary only if the /etc/inittab fi le does not already contain a record for the srcmstr daemon.

1. Make a record for the srcmstr daemon in the /etc/inittab fi le using the mkitab command. For example, to make a record identical to the one that appears in the default /etc/inittab fi le, type:

```
mkitab -i fbcheck srcmstr:2:respawn:/usr/sbin/srcmstr
```

The -i fbcheck flag ensures that the record is inserted before all subsystems records.

2. Tell the init command to reprocess the /etc/inittab fi le by typing:

telinit q

When init revisits the /etc/inittab fi le, it processes the newly entered record for the srcmstr daemon and starts the SRC.

The following are the prerequisites for starting or stopping a subsystem, subsystem group, or subserver:

- To start or stop an SRC resource, the SRC must be running. The SRC is normally started during system initialization. The default /etc/inittab fi le, which determines what processes are started during initialization, contains a record for the srcmstr daemon (the SRC). To see if the SRC is running, type ps -A and look for a process named srcmstr .
- The user or process starting an SRC resource must have root user authority. The process that initializes the system ( init command) has root user authority.
- The user or process stopping an SRC resource must have root user authority.

The startsrc command can be used:

- From the /etc/inittab fi le so the resource is started during system initialization
- From the command line
- With SMIT

When you start a subsystem group, all of its subsystems are also started. When you start a subsystem, all of its subservers are also started. When you start a subserver, its parent subsystem is also started if it is not already running.

When you stop a subsystem, all its subservers are also stopped. However, when you stop a subserver, the state of its parent subsystem is not changed.

Both the startsrc and stopsrc commands contain flags that allow requests to be made on local or remote hosts. See the srcmstr command for the con fi guration requirements to support remote SRC requests.

## Displaying status of a subsystem or subsystems

Use the lssrc command to display the status of a System Resource Controller (SRC) resource such as a subsystem, a group of subsystems, or a subserver.

All subsystems can return a short status report that includes which group the subsystem belongs to, whether the subsystem is active, and what its process ID (PID) is. If a subsystem does not use the signals communication method, it can be programmed to return a long status report containing additional status information.

The lssrc command provides flags and parameters for specifying the subsystem by name or PID, for listing all subsystems, for requesting a short or long status report, and for requesting the status of SRC resources either locally or on remote hosts.

See the srcmstr command for the con fi guration requirements to support remote SRC requests.

## Refreshing a subsystem or subsystem group

Use the refresh command to tell a System Resource Controller (SRC) resource such as a subsystem or a group of subsystems to refresh itself.

The following are the prerequisites for refreshing a subsystem or subsystem group:

- The SRC must be running.
- The resource you want to refresh must not use the signals communications method.
- The resource you want to refresh must be programmed to respond to the refresh request.

The refresh command provides flags and parameters for specifying the subsystem by name or PID. You can also use it to request a subsystem or group of subsystems be refreshed, either locally or on remote hosts. See the srcmstr command for the con fi guration requirements to support remote SRC requests.

The System Resource Controller (SRC) is started during system initialization with a record for the /usr/ sbin/srcmstr daemon in the /etc/inittab fi le.

## Operating system fi les

Files are used for all input and output (I/O) of information in the operating system, to standardize access to both software and hardware.

Input occurs when the contents of a fi le is modi fi ed or written to. Output occurs when the contents of one fi le is read or transferred to another fi le. For example, to create a printed copy of a fi le, the system reads the information from the text fi le and writes that information to the fi le representing the printer.

## Types of fi les

The types of fi les recognized by the system are either regular , directory , or special . However, the operating system uses many variations of these basic types.

The following basic types of fi les exist:

Item

Description

regular

Stores data (text, binary, and executable)

directory

Contains information used to access other fi les

special

De fi nes a FIFO ( fi rst-in, fi rst-out) pipe fi le or a physical device

All fi le types recognized by the system fall into one of these categories. However, the operating system uses many variations of these basic types.

## Regular fi les

Regular fi les are the most common fi les and are used to contain data. Regular fi les are in the form of text fi les or binary fi les:

## Text fi les

Text fi les are regular fi les that contain information stored in ASCII format text and are readable by the user. You can display and print these fi les. The lines of a text fi le must not contain NUL characters, and none can exceed {LINE\_MAX} bytes in length, including the newline character.

The term text fi le does not prevent the inclusion of control or other nonprintable characters (other than NUL ). Therefore, standard utilities that list text fi les as inputs or outputs are either able to process the special characters or they explicitly describe their limitations within their individual sections.

## Binary fi les

Binary fi les are regular fi les that contain information readable by the computer. Binary fi les might be executable fi les that instruct the system to accomplish a job. Commands and programs are stored in executable, binary fi les. Special compiling programs translate ASCII text into binary code.

Text and binary fi les differ only in that text fi les have lines of less than {LINE\_MAX} bytes, with no NUL characters, each terminated by a newline character.

## Directory fi les

Directory fi les contain information that the system needs to access all types of fi les, but directory fi les do not contain the actual fi le data. As a result, directories occupy less space than a regular fi le and give the fi le system structure flexibility and depth. Each directory entry represents either a fi le or a subdirectory. Each entry contains the name of the fi le and the fi le's index node reference number ( i-node number ). The i-node number points to the unique index node assigned to the fi le. The i-node number describes the location of the data associated with the fi le. Directories are created and controlled by a separate set of commands.

## Special fi les

Special fi les de fi ne devices for the system or are temporary fi les created by processes. The basic types of special fi les are FIFO ( fi rst-in, fi rst-out), block, and character. FIFO fi les are also called pipes . Pipes are created by one process to temporarily allow communication with another process. These fi les cease to exist when the fi rst process fi nishes. Block and character fi les de fi ne devices.

Every fi le has a set of permissions (called access modes ) that determine who can read, modify, or execute the fi le.

## Related concepts

## File and directory access modes

Every fi le has an owner. For new fi les, the user who creates the fi le is the owner of that fi le. The owner assigns an access mode to the fi le. Access modes grant other system users permission to read, modify, or execute the fi le. Only the fi le's owner or users with root authority can change the access mode of a fi le.

## File naming conventions

The name of each fi le must be unique within the directory where it is stored. This ensures that the fi le also has a unique path name in the fi le system.

File naming guidelines are:

- A fi le name can be up to 255 characters long and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- The operating system is case-sensitive, which means it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters in fi le names. Therefore, FILEA , FiLea , and filea are three distinct fi le names, even if they reside in the same directory.

- File names should be as descriptive and meaningful as possible.
- Directories follow the same naming conventions as fi les.
- Certain characters have special meaning to the operating system. Avoid using these characters when you are naming fi les. These characters include the following:
- A fi le name is hidden from a normal directory listing if it begins with a dot ( . ). When the ls command is entered with the -a flag, the hidden fi les are listed along with regular fi les and directories.

```
/ \ " ' * ; -? [ ] ( ) ~ ! $ { } &lt > # @ & | space tab newline
```

## File path names

The path name for each fi le and directory in the fi le system consists of the names of every directory that precedes it in the tree structure.

Because all paths in a fi le system originate from the /( root ) directory, each fi le in the fi le system has a unique relationship to the root directory, known as the absolute path name . Absolute path names begin with the slash ( / ) symbol. For example, the absolute path name of fi le h could be /B/C/h . Notice that two fi les named h can exist in the system. Because the absolute paths to the two fi les are different, /B/h and /B/C/h , each fi le named h has a unique name within the system. Every component of a path name is a directory except the fi nal component. The fi nal component of a path name can be a fi le name.

Note: Path names cannot exceed 1023 characters in length.

## Pattern matching with wildcards and metacharacters

Wildcard characters provide a convenient way to specify multiple fi le names or directory names.

The wildcard characters are asterisk ( * ) and question mark ( ? ). The metacharacters are open and close square brackets ( [ ] ), hyphen ( -), and exclamation mark ( ! ).

Pattern matching using the * wildcard character

Use the asterisk ( * ) to match any sequence or string of characters.

The ( * ) indicates any characters, including no characters.

See the following examples:

- If you have the following fi les in your directory:

```
1test 2test afile1 afile2 bfile1 file file1 file10 file2 file3 and you want to refer to only the fi les that begin with file , use: file*
```

The fi les selected would be: file , file1 , file10 , file2 , and file3 .

- To refer to only the fi les that contain the word file , use:

*file*

The fi les selected would be: afile1 , afile2 , bfile1 , file , file1 , file10 , file2 , and file3 .

Pattern matching using the ? wildcard character Use the ? to match any one character.

The ? indicates any single character. See the following examples:

- To refer to only the fi les that start with fi le and end with a single character, use:

file?

The fi les selected would be: file1 , file2 , file3 .

- To refer to only the fi les that start with fi le and end with any two characters, use:

file??

The fi le selected would be: file10 .

Pattern matching using [ ] shell metacharacters

Metacharacters offer another type of wildcard notation by enclosing the desired characters within [ ] . It is like using the ? , but it allows you to choose speci fi c characters to be matched.

The [ ] also allow you to specify a range of values using the hyphen ( -). To specify all the letters in the alphabet, use [[:alpha:]] . To specify all the lowercase letters in the alphabet, use [[:lower:]] .

See the following examples:

- To refer to only the fi les that end in 1 or 2 , use:

*file[12]

The fi les selected would be: afile1 , afile2 , file1 , and file2 .

- To refer to only the fi les that start with any number, use:

```
[0123456789]* or [0-9]*
```

The fi les selected would be: 1test and 2test .

- To refer to only the fi les that do not begin with an a , use:

[!a]*

The fi les selected would be: 1test , 2test , bfile1 , file , file1 , file10 , file2 , and file3 .

## Pattern matching versus regular expressions

Regular expressions allow you to select speci fi c strings from a set of character strings. The use of regular expressions is generally associated with text processing.

Regular expressions can represent a wide variety of possible strings. While many regular expressions can be interpreted differently depending on the current locale, globalization features provide for contextual invariance across locales.

Pattern matching is used by the shell commands such as the ls command, whereas regular expressions are used to search for strings of text in a fi le by using commands, such as the grep command.

The following table lists some of the equivalent regular expressions for corresponding pattern matching characters:

Table 57. Difference between Pattern matching and Regular Expression

| Pattern Matching   | Regular Expression   |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| *                  | .*                   |
| ?                  | .                    |
| [!a]               | [^a]                 |
| [abc]              | [abc]                |
| [[:alpha:]]        | [[:alpha:]]          |

The following table lists some of the examples for command, output, and descriptions:

## Administering fi les

There are many ways to work with the fi les on your system. Usually you create a text fi le with a text editor.

The common editors in the UNIX environment are vi and ed . Because several text editors are available, you can choose an editor you feel comfortable with.

You can also create fi les by using input and output redirection. You can send the output of a command to a new fi le or append it to an existing fi le.

After creating and modifying fi les, you might have to copy or move fi les from one directory to another, rename fi les to distinguish different versions of a fi le, or give different names to the same fi le. You might also need to create directories when working on different projects.

Also, you might need to delete certain fi les. Your directory can quickly get cluttered with fi les that contain old or useless information. To release storage space on your system, ensure that you delete fi les that are no longer needed.

## Deleting fi les (rm command)

Use the rm command to remove fi les you no longer need.

The rm command removes the entries for a speci fi ed fi le, group of fi les, or certain select fi les from a list within a directory. User con fi rmation, read permission, and write permission are not required before a fi le is removed when you use the rm command. However, you must have write permission for the directory containing the fi le.

The following are examples of how to use the rm command:

- To delete the fi le named myfile , type the following:

rm myfile

- To delete all the fi les in the mydir directory, one by one, type the following:

```
rm -i mydir/*
```

After each fi le name displays, type y and press Enter to delete the fi le. Or to keep the fi le, just press Enter.

## Moving and renaming fi les (mv command)

Use the mv command to move fi les and directories from one directory to another or to rename a fi le or directory. If you move a fi le or directory to a new directory without specifying a new name, it retains its original name.

<!-- image -->

Attention: The mv command can overwrite many existing fi les unless you specify the -i flag. The -i flag prompts you to con fi rm before it overwrites a fi le. The -f flag does not prompt you. If both the -f and -i flags are speci fi ed in combination, the last flag speci fi ed takes precedence.

## Moving fi les with mv command

The following are examples of how to use the mv command:

- To move a fi le to another directory and give it a new name, type the following:

```
mv intro manual/chap1
```

This moves the intro fi le to the manual/chap1 directory. The name intro is removed from the current directory, and the same fi le appears as chap1 in the manual directory.

- To move a fi le to another directory, keeping the same name, type the following:

```
mv chap3 manual
```

This moves chap3 to manual/chap3 .

## Renaming fi les with mv command

Use the mv command to change the name of a fi le without moving it to another directory.

```
To rename a fi le, type the following: mv appendix apndx.a
```

This renames the appendix fi le to apndx.a . If a fi le named apndx.a already exists, its old contents are replaced with those of the appendix fi le.

## Copying fi les (cp command)

Use the cp command to create a copy of the contents of the fi le or directory speci fi ed by the SourceFile or SourceDirectory parameters into the fi le or directory speci fi ed by the TargetFile or TargetDirectory parameters.

If the fi le speci fi ed as the TargetFile exists, the copy writes over the original contents of the fi le without warning. If you are copying more than one SourceFile , the target must be a directory.

If a fi le with the same name exists at the new destination, the copied fi le overwrites the fi le at the new destination. Therefore, it is a good practice to assign a new name for the copy of the fi le to ensure that a fi le of the same name does not exist in the destination directory.

To place a copy of the SourceFile into a directory, specify a path to an existing directory for the TargetDirectory parameter. Files maintain their respective names when copied to a directory unless you specify a new fi le name at the end of the path. The cp command also copies entire directories into other directories if you specify the -r or -R flags.

You can also copy special-device fi les using the -R flag. Specifying -R causes the special fi les to be re-created under the new path name. Specifying the -r flag causes the cp command to attempt to copy the special fi les to regular fi les.

The following are examples of how to use the cp command:

- To make a copy of a fi le in the current directory, type the following:

```
cp prog.c prog.bak
```

This copies prog.c to prog.bak . If the prog.bak fi le does not already exist, then the cp command creates it. If it does exist, then the cp command replaces it with a copy of the prog.c fi le.

- To copy a fi le in your current directory into another directory, type the following:

```
cp jones /home/nick/clients
```

This copies the jones fi le to /home/nick/clients/jones .

- To copy all the fi les in a directory to a new directory, type the following:

```
cp /home/janet/clients/* /home/nick/customers
```

This copies only the fi les in the clients directory to the customers directory.

- To copy a speci fi c set of fi les to another directory, type the following:

```
cp jones lewis smith /home/nick/clients
```

This copies the jones , lewis , and smith fi les in your current working directory to the /home/nick/ clients directory.

- To use pattern-matching characters to copy fi les, type the following:

```
cp programs/*.c .
```

This copies the fi les in the programs directory that end with .c to the current directory, indicated by the single dot ( . ). You must type a space between the c and the fi nal dot.

## Finding fi les ( fi nd command)

Use the find command to recursively search the directory tree for each speci fi ed Path , seeking fi les that match a Boolean expression written using the terms given in the following text.

The output from the find command depends on the terms speci fi ed by the Expression parameter.

The following are examples of how to use the find command:

- To list all fi les in the fi le system with the name .profile , type the following:

```
find / -name .profile
```

This searches the entire fi le system and writes the complete path names of all fi les named .profile . The slash (/) tells the find command to search the / ( root ) directory and all of its subdirectories.

To save time, limit the search by specifying the directories where you think the fi les might be.

- To perform a case-insensitive search operation for all the fi les with the test fi lename in the current directory and all of its subdirectories, enter the following command:
- To list fi les having a speci fi c permission code of 0600 in the current directory tree, type the following:

```
find . -iname test
```

```
find . -perm 0600
```

This lists the names of the fi les that have only owner-read and owner-write permission. The dot ( . ) tells the find command to search the current directory and its subdirectories. For an explanation of permission codes, see the chmod command.

- To search several directories for fi les with certain permission codes, type the following:

```
find manual clients proposals -perm -0600
```

This lists the names of the fi les that have owner-read and owner-write permission and possibly other permissions. The manual , clients , and proposals directories and their subdirectories are searched. In the previous example, -perm 0600 selects only fi les with permission codes that match 0600 exactly. In this example, -perm -0600 selects fi les with permission codes that allow the accesses indicated by 0600 and other accesses above the 0600 level. This also matches the permission codes 0622 and 2744.

- To list all fi les in the current directory that have been changed during the current 24-hour period, type the following:
- To search for regular fi les with multiple links, type the following:

```
find . -ctime 1
```

```
find . -type f -links +1
```

This lists the names of the ordinary fi les ( -type f ) that have more than one link (-links +1 ).

Note: Every directory has at least two links: the entry in its parent directory and its own . (dot) entry. For more information on multiple fi le links, see the ln command.

- To search for all fi les that are exactly 414 bytes in length, type the following:
- To perform a case-insensitive search operation for all the fi les in the root directory and its subdirectories whose fi lename contains the string main and the extension is of any length that ends with the alphabet o , enter the following command:
- To perform a case-insensitive search operation for all the fi les in the root directory and its subdirectories whose fi lename contains the string main and have a single-character extension, enter the following command:

```
find . -size 414c
```

```
find / -iname "*main*.*o"
```

```
The search result of this command returns fi les like main.o , app_main.c.o , mAin.O , or APP_MAIN.o .
```

```
find / -iname "*main*.?"
```

The search result of this command returns fi les like main.c , app\_main.o , MAIN.c , or App\_main.o .

- To perform a case-insensitive search operation for all the fi les in the root directory and its subdirectories whose extension is .T , followed by any one character, and an alphabet t , enter the following command:

```
find / -iname "*.T?t"
```

The search result of this command returns fi les like file.T1t , log.Tot , file.txt , log.tot , or log.toT .

- To perform a case-insensitive search operation for all the fi les in the root directory and its subdirectories whose extension is either .Sh , .md , .Sd , or .mh , enter the following command:

```
find / -iname "*.[Sm][hd]"
```

The search result of this command returns fi les like readme.sh , logo.md , logo.sd , readme.mh , readme.SH , or logo.mD .

## Displaying the fi le type ( fi le command)

Use the file command to read the fi les speci fi ed by the File or -f FileList parameter, perform a series of tests on each one, and attempt to classify the fi les by type. The command then writes the fi le types to standard output.

If a fi le appears to be ASCII, the file command examines the fi rst 512 bytes and determines its language. If a fi le does not appear to be ASCII, the file command further attempts to determine whether it is a binary data fi le or a text fi le that contains extended characters.

If the File parameter speci fi es an executable or object module fi le and the version number is greater than 0, the file command displays the version stamp.

The file command uses the /etc/magic fi le to identify fi les that have a magic number; that is, any fi le containing a numeric or string constant that indicates the type.

The following are examples of how to use the file command:

- To display the type of information the fi le named myfile contains, type the following:

```
file myfile
```

This displays the fi le type of myfile (such as directory, data, ASCII text, C program source, or archive).

- To display the type of each fi le named in the filenames.lst fi le, which contains a list of fi le names, type the following:

```
file -f filenames.lst
```

This displays the type of each fi le named in the filenames.lst fi le. Each fi le name must display on a separate line.

- To create the filenames.lst fi le that contains all the fi le names in the current directory, type the following:

```
ls > filenames.lst
```

Edit the filenames.lst fi le as desired.

## Commands for displaying fi le contents (pg, more, page, and cat commands)

The pg , more , and page commands allow you to view the contents of a fi le and control the speed at which your fi les are displayed.

You can also use the cat command to display the contents of one or more fi les on your screen. Combining the cat command with the pg command allows you to read the contents of a fi le one full screen at a time.

You can also display the contents of fi les by using input and output redirection.

## Related concepts

## Input and output redirection

The AIX operating system allows you to manipulate the input and output (I/O) of data to and from your system by using speci fi c I/O commands and symbols.

Using the pg command

Use the pg command to read the fi les named in the File parameter and writes them to standard output one screen at a time.

If you specify hyphen (-) as the File parameter or run the pg command without options, the pg command reads standard input. Each screen is followed by a prompt. If you press the Enter key, another screen displays. Subcommands used with the pg command let you review content that has already passed.

For example, to look at the contents of the fi le myfile one page at a time, type the following:

```
pg myfile
```

Using the more or page commands

Use the more or page command to display continuous text one screen at a time.

It pauses after each screen and prints the fi lename and percent completed (for example, myfile (7%) ) at the bottom of the screen. If you then press the Enter key, the more command displays an additional line. If you press the Spacebar, the more command displays another screen of text.

Note: On some terminal models, the more command clears the screen, instead of scrolling, before displaying the next screen of text.

For example, to view a fi le named myfile , type the following:

```
more myfile
```

Press the Spacebar to view the next screen.

cat command

Use the cat command to read each File parameter in sequence and writes it to standard output.

See the following examples:

- To display the contents of the fi le notes , type the following:

```
cat notes
```

If the fi le is more than 24 lines long, some of it scrolls off the screen. To list a fi le one page at a time, use the pg command.

- To display the contents of the fi les notes , notes2 , and notes3 , type the following:

```
cat notes notes2 notes3
```

## Finding text strings within fi les (grep command)

Use the grep command to search the speci fi ed fi le for the pattern speci fi ed by the Pattern parameter and writes each matching line to standard output.

The following are examples of how to use the grep command:

- To search in a fi le named pgm.s for a pattern that contains some of the pattern-matching characters *, ^, ?, [, ], \(, \), \{, and \}, in this case, lines starting with any lowercase or uppercase letter, type the following:

```
grep "^[a-zA-Z]" pgm.s
```

This displays all lines in the pgm.s fi le that begin with a letter.

- To display all lines in a fi le named sort.c that do not match a particular pattern, type the following:

```
grep -v bubble sort.c
```

This displays all lines that do not contain the word bubble in the sort.c fi le.

- To display lines in the output of the ls command that match the string staff , type the following:

```
ls -l | grep staff
```

## Sorting text fi les (sort command)

Use the sort command to alphabetize lines in the fi les speci fi ed by the File parameters and write the result to standard output.

If the File parameter speci fi es more than one fi le, the sort command concatenates the fi les and alphabetizes them as one fi le.

Note: The sort command is case-sensitive and orders uppercase letters before lowercase (this behavior is dependent on the locale).

In the following examples, the contents of the fi le named names are:

```
marta denise joyce endrica melanie
```

and the contents of the fi le named states are:

```
texas colorado ohio
```

- To display the sorted contents of the fi le named names , type the following:

```
sort names
```

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
denise endrica joyce marta melanie
```

- To display the sorted contents of the names and states fi les, type the following:

```
sort names states
```

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
colorado denise endrica joyce marta melanie ohio texas
```

- To replace the original contents of the fi le named names with its sorted contents, type the following:

```
sort -o names names
```

This replaces the contents of the names fi le with the same data but in sorted order.

## Comparing fi les (diff command)

Use the diff command to compare text fi les. It can compare single fi les or the contents of directories.

When the diff command is run on regular fi les, and when it compares text fi les in different directories, the diff command tells which lines must be changed in the fi les so that they match.

The following are examples of how to use the diff command:

- To compare two fi les, type the following:

```
diff chap1.bak chap1
```

This displays the differences between the chap1.bak and chap1 fi les.

- To compare two fi les while ignoring differences in the amount of white space, type the following:

```
diff -w prog.c.bak prog.c
```

If the two fi les differ only in the number of spaces and tabs between words, the diff -w command considers the fi les to be the same.

## Counting words, lines, and bytes in fi les (wc command)

Use the wc command to count the number of lines, words, and bytes in the fi les speci fi ed by the File parameter.

If a fi le is not speci fi ed for the File parameter, standard input is used. The command writes the results to standard output and keeps a total count for all named fi les. If flags are speci fi ed, the ordering of the flags determines the ordering of the output. A word is de fi ned as a string of characters delimited by spaces, tabs, or newline characters.

When fi les are speci fi ed on the command line, their names are printed along with the counts.

See the following examples:

- To display the line, word, and byte counts of the fi le named chap1 , type the following:

```
wc chap1
```

This displays the number of lines, words, and bytes in the chap1 fi le.

- To display only byte and word counts, type the following:

```
wc -cw chap*
```

This displays the number of bytes and words in each fi le where the name starts with chap , and displays the totals.

## Displaying the fi rst lines of fi les (head command)

Use the head command to write to standard output the fi rst few lines of each of the speci fi ed fi les or of the standard input.

If no flag is speci fi ed with the head command, the fi rst 10 lines are displayed by default.

For example, to display the fi rst fi ve lines of the Test fi le, type the following:

```
head -5 Test
```

## Displaying the last lines of fi les (tail command)

Use the tail command to write the fi le speci fi ed by the File parameter to standard output beginning at a speci fi ed point.

See the following examples:

- To display the last 10 lines of the notes fi le, type the following:
- To specify the number of lines to start reading from the end of the notes fi le, type the following:
- To display the notes fi le one page at a time, beginning with the 200th byte, type the following:
- To follow the growth of the fi le named accounts , type the following:

```
tail notes
```

```
tail -20 notes
```

```
tail -c +200 notes | pg
```

```
tail -f accounts
```

This displays the last 10 lines of the accounts fi le. The tail command continues to display lines as they are added to the accounts fi le. The display continues until you press the (Ctrl-C) key sequence to stop the display.

## Cutting sections of text fi les (cut command)

Use the cut command to write selected bytes, characters, or fi elds from each line of a fi le to standard output.

See the following examples:

- To display several fi elds of each line of a fi le, type the following:

```
cut -f1,5 -d: /etc/passwd
```

This displays the login name and full user name fi elds of the system password fi le. These are the fi rst and fi fth fi elds ( -f1,5 ) separated by colons ( -d: ).

- If the /etc/passwd fi le looks like this:

```
su:*:0:0:User with special privileges:/:/usr/bin/sh daemon:*:1:1::/etc: bin:*:2:2::/usr/bin: sys:*:3:3::/usr/src: adm:*:4:4:system administrator:/var/adm:/usr/bin/sh pierre:*:200:200:Pierre Harper:/home/pierre:/usr/bin/sh joan:*:202:200:Joan Brown:/home/joan:/usr/bin/sh
```

the cut command produces:

```
su:User with special privileges
```

```
daemon: bin: sys: adm:system administrator pierre:Pierre Harper joan:Joan Brown
```

## Pasting sections of text fi les (paste command)

Use the paste command to merge the lines of up to 12 fi les into one fi le.

See the following examples:

- If you have a fi le named names that contains the following text:

```
rachel jerry mark linda scott
```

and another fi le named places that contains the following text:

```
New York Austin Chicago Boca Raton Seattle
```

and another fi le named dates that contains the following text:

```
February 5 March 13 June 21 July 16 November 4
```

To paste the text of the fi les names , places, and dates together, type the following:

```
paste names places dates > npd
```

This creates a fi le named npd that contains the data from the names fi le in one column, the places fi le in another, and the dates fi le in a third. The npd fi le now contains the following:

| rachel   | New York   | February 5   |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| jerry    | Austin     | March 13     |
| mark     | Chicago    | June 21      |
| linda    | Boca Raton | July 16      |
| scott    | Seattle    | November 4   |

A tab character separates the name, place, and date on each line. These columns do not align, because the tab stops are set at every eighth column.

- To separate the columns with a character other than a tab, type the following:

```
paste -d"!@" names places dates > npd
```

This alternates ! and @ as the column separators. If the names , places , and dates fi les are the same as in example 1, then the npd fi le contains the following:

```
rachel!New York@February 5 jerry!Austin@March 13 mark!Chicago@June 21 linda!Boca Raton@July 16 scott!Seattle@November 4
```

- To list the current directory in four columns, type the following:

```
ls | paste ----
```

Each hyphen ( -) tells the paste command to create a column containing data read from the standard input. The fi rst line is put in the fi rst column, the second line in the second column, and so on.

## Numbering lines in text fi les (nl command)

Use the nl command to read the speci fi ed fi le (standard input by default), numbers the lines in the input, and writes the numbered lines to standard output.

See the following examples:

- To number only the lines that are not blank, type the following:

```
nl chap1
```

This displays a numbered listing of chap1 , numbering only the lines that are not blank in the body sections.

- To number all lines, type the following:

```
nl -ba chap1
```

This numbers all the lines in the fi le named chap1 , including blank lines.

## Removing columns in text fi les (colrm command)

Use the colrm command to remove speci fi ed columns from a fi le. Input is taken from standard input. Output is sent to standard output.

If the command is called with one parameter, the columns of each line from the speci fi ed column to the last column are removed. If the command is called with two parameters, the columns from the fi rst speci fi ed column to the second speci fi ed column are removed.

Note: Column numbering starts with column 1.

See the following examples:

- To remove columns from the text.fil fi le, type the following:

```
colrm 6 < text.fil
```

If text.fil contains:

| 123456789                        |
|----------------------------------|
| then the colrm command displays: |
| 12345                            |

## File and directory links

Links are connections between a fi le name and an index node reference number (i-node number), the internal representation of a fi le. Because directory entries contain fi le names paired with i-node numbers, every directory entry is a link.

The i-node number actually identi fi es the fi le, not the fi le name. By using links, any i-node number or fi le can be known by many different names. For example, i-node number 798 contains a memo regarding June sales in the Omaha of fi ce. Presently, the directory entry for this memo is as follows:

## i-node Number

File Name

798

memo

Because this information relates to information stored in the sales and omaha directories, linking is used to share the information where it is needed. Using the ln command, links are created to these directories. Now the fi le has three fi le names as follows:

|   i-node Number | File Name       |
|-----------------|-----------------|
|             798 | memo            |
|             798 | sales/june      |
|             798 | omaha/junesales |

When you use the pg or cat command to view the contents of any of the three fi le names, the same information is displayed. If you edit the contents of the i-node number from any of the three fi le names, the contents of the data displayed by all of the fi le names will reflect any changes.

## Types of links

There are two types of links: hard and symbolic.

Links are created with the ln command and are of the following types:

Item

Description hard link

Allows access to the data of a fi le from a new fi le name. Hard links ensure the existence of a fi le. When the last hard link is removed, the i-node number and its data are deleted. Hard links can be created only between fi les that are in the same fi le system.

symbolic link

Allows access to data in other fi le systems from a new fi le name. The symbolic link is a special type of fi le that contains a path name. When a process encounters a symbolic link, the process may search that path. Symbolic links do not protect a fi le from deletion from the fi le system.

Note: The user who creates a fi le retains ownership of that fi le no matter how many links are created. Only the owner of the fi le or the root user can set the access mode for that fi le. However, changes can be made to the fi le from a linked fi le name with the proper access mode.

A fi le or directory exists as long as there is one hard link to the i-node number for that fi le. In the long listing displayed by the ls -l command, the number of hard links to each fi le and subdirectory is given. All hard links are treated equally by the operating system, regardless of which link was created fi rst.

## Linking fi les (ln command)

Linking fi les with the ln command is a convenient way to work with the same data as if it were in more than one place.

Links are created by giving alternate names to the original fi le. The use of links allows a large fi le, such as a database or mailing list, to be shared by several users without making copies of that fi le. Not only do links save disk space, but changes made to one fi le are automatically reflected in all the linked fi les.

The ln command links the fi le designated in the SourceFile parameter to the fi le designated by the TargetFile parameter or to the same fi le name in another directory speci fi ed by the TargetDirectory parameter. By default, the ln command creates hard links. To use the ln command to create symbolic links, add the -s flag.

Note: You cannot link fi les across fi le systems without using the -s flag.

If you are linking a fi le to a new name, you can list only one fi le. If you are linking to a directory, you can list more than one fi le.

The TargetFile parameter is optional. If you do not designate a target fi le, the ln command creates a fi le in your current directory. The new fi le inherits the name of the fi le designated in the SourceFile parameter.

See the following examples:

- To create a link to a fi le named chap1 , type the following:

```
ln -f chap1 intro
```

This links chap1 to the new name, intro . When the -f flag is used, the fi le name intro is created if it does not already exist. If intro does exist, the fi le is replaced by a link to chap1 . Both the chap1 and intro fi le names refer to the same fi le.

- To link a fi le named index to the same name in another directory named manual , type the following:

```
ln index manual
```

This links index to the new name, manual/index .

- To link several fi les to names in another directory, type the following:

```
ln chap2 jim/chap3 /home/manual
```

This links chap2 to the new name /home/manual/chap2 and jim/chap3 to /home/manual/chap3 .

- To use the ln command with pattern-matching characters, type the following:

```
ln manual/* .
```

Note: You must type a space between the asterisk and the period.

This links all fi les in the manual directory into the current directory, dot (.), giving them the same names they have in the manual directory.

- To create a symbolic link, type the following:

```
ln -s /tmp/toc toc
```

This creates the symbolic link, toc , in the current directory. The toc fi le points to the /tmp/toc fi le. If the /tmp/toc fi le exists, the cat toc command lists its contents.

- To achieve identical results without designating the TargetFile parameter, type the following:

```
ln -s /tmp/toc
```

## Command for removing linked fi les

The rm command removes the link from the fi le name that you indicate.

When one of several hard-linked fi le names is deleted, the fi le is not completely deleted because it remains under the other name. When the last link to an i-node number is removed, the data is removed as well. The i-node number is then available for reuse by the system.

## DOS fi les

The AIX operating system allows you to work with DOS fi les on your system.

Copy to a diskette the DOS fi les you want to work with. Your system can read these fi les into a base operating system directory in the correct format and back onto the diskette in DOS format.

Note: The wildcard characters * and ? (asterisk and question mark) do not work correctly with the commands discussed in this section (although they do with the base operating system shell). If you do not specify a fi le name extension, the fi le name is matched as if you had speci fi ed a blank extension.

## Copying DOS fi les to base operating system fi les

Use the dosread command to copy the speci fi ed DOS fi le to the speci fi ed base operating system fi le.

Note: DOS fi le-naming conventions are used with one exception. Because the backslash ( \ ) character can have special meaning to the base operating system, use a slash ( / ) character as the delimiter to specify subdirectory names in a DOS path name.

See the following examples:

- To copy a text fi le named chap1.doc from a DOS diskette to the base operating fi le system, type the following:

```
dosread -a chap1.doc chap1
```

This copies the DOS text fi le \CHAP1.DOC on the /dev/fd0 default device to the base operating system fi le chap1 in the current directory.

- To copy a binary fi le from a DOS diskette to the base operating fi le system, type the following:

```
dosread -D/dev/fd0 /survey/test.dta /home/fran/testdata
```

This copies the \SURVEY\TEST.DTA DOS data fi le on /dev/fd0 to the base operating system fi le / home/fran/testdata .

## Copying base operating system fi les to DOS fi les

Use the doswrite command to copy the speci fi ed base operating system fi le to the speci fi ed DOS fi le.

Note: DOS fi le-naming conventions are used with one exception. Because the backslash ( \ ) character can have special meaning to the base operating system, use a slash ( / ) character as the delimiter to specify subdirectory names in a DOS path name.

See the following examples:

- To copy a text fi le named chap1 from the base operating fi le system to a DOS diskette, type the following:

```
doswrite -a chap1 chap1.doc
```

This copies the base operating system fi le chap1 in the current directory to the DOS text fi le \CHAP1.DOC on /dev/fd0 .

- To copy a binary fi le named /survey/test.dta from the base operating fi le system to a DOS diskette, type the following:

```
doswrite -D/dev/fd0 /home/fran/testdata /survey/test.dta
```

This copies the base operating system data fi le /home/fran/testdata to the DOS fi le \SURVEY\TEST.DTA on /dev/fd0 .

## Deleting DOS fi les

Use the dosdel command to delete the speci fi ed DOS fi le.

Note: DOS fi le-naming conventions are used with one exception. Because the backslash (\) character can have special meaning to the base operating system, use a slash (/) character as the delimiter to specify subdirectory names in a DOS path name.

The dosdel command converts lowercase characters in the fi le or directory name to uppercase before it checks the disk. Because all fi le names are assumed to be full (not relative) path names, you need not add the initial slash ( / ).

For example, to delete a DOS fi le named file.ext on the default device ( /dev/fd0 ), type the following:

dosdel file.ext

## Displaying contents of a DOS directory

Use the dosdir command to display information about the speci fi ed DOS fi les or directories.

Note: DOS fi le-naming conventions are used with one exception. Because the backslash (\) character can have special meaning to the base operating system, use a slash (/) character as the delimiter to specify subdirectory names in a DOS path name.

The dosdir command converts lowercase characters in the fi le or directory name to uppercase before it checks the disk. Because all fi le names are assumed to be full (not relative) path names, you need not add the initial / (slash).

For example, to read a directory of the DOS fi les on /dev/fd0 , type the following:

dosdir

The command returns the names of the fi les and disk-space information, similar to the following.

| PG3-25.TXT               |

## Operating system shells

Your interface to the operating system is called a shell .

The shell is the outermost layer of the operating system. Shells incorporate a programming language to control processes and fi les, as well as to start and control other programs. The shell manages the interaction between you and the operating system by prompting you for input, interpreting that input for the operating system, and then handling any resulting output from the operating system.

Shells provide a way for you to communicate with the operating system. This communication is carried out either interactively (input from the keyboard is acted upon immediately) or as a shell script. A shell script is a sequence of shell and operating system commands that is stored in a fi le.

When you log in to the system, the system locates the name of a shell program to execute. After it is executed, the shell displays a command prompt. This prompt is usually a $ (dollar sign). When you type a

command at the prompt and press the Enter key, the shell evaluates the command and attempts to carry it out. Depending on your command instructions, the shell writes the command output to the screen or redirects the output. It then returns the command prompt and waits for you to type another command.

A command line is the line on which you type. It contains the shell prompt. The basic format for each line is as follows:

```
$ Command Argument(s)
```

The shell considers the fi rst word of a command line (up to the fi rst blank space) as the command and all subsequent words as arguments.

Note: When libc.a is moved or renamed, the Killed error message is displayed from the shell because there is no libc.a fi le available for the system to load and run the utilities. The recsh command invokes the recovery shell, which provides an ability to rename libc.a if it is accidently moved.

## Shell concepts

Before you start working with the different types of shells available for AIX you need to understand basic terminology and features.

## Available shells

The following are the shells that are provided with AIX.

- Korn shell (started with the ksh command)
- Bourne shell (started with the bsh command)
- Restricted shell (a limited version of the Bourne shell, and started with the Rsh command)
- POSIX shell (also known as the Korn Shell, and started with the psh command)
- Restricted shell for the Korn shell ( ksh and ksh93 ). The ksh and ksh93 shells are provided with their restricted shell equivalents rksh and rksh93 .
- Default shell (started with the sh command)
- C shell (started with the csh command)
- Trusted shell (a limited version of the Korn shell, and started with the tsh command)
- Remote shell (started with the rsh command)

The login shell refers to the shell that is loaded when you log in to the computer system. Your login shell is set in the /etc/passwd fi le. The Korn shell is the standard operating system login shell and is backward-compatible with the Bourne Shell.

The Korn shell ( /usr/bin/ksh ) is set up as the default shell. The default or standard shell refers to the shells linked to and started with the /usr/bin/sh command. The Bourne shell ( /usr/bin/sh ) can be substituted as the default shell. The POSIX shell, which is invoked by the /usr/bin/psh command, resides as a link to the /usr/bin/sh command.

## Related concepts

Bourne shell

The Bourne shell is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language.

Korn shell or POSIX shell commands

The Korn shell is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language. It conforms to the Portable Operating System Interface for Computer Environments (POSIX), an international standard for operating systems.

| identi fi er     | A sequence of letters, digits, or underscores from the portable character set, starting with a letter or underscore. The fi rst character of an identi fi er must not be a digit. Identi fi ers are used as names for aliases, functions, and named parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| list             | A sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the following symbols: semicolon ( ; ), ampersand ( & ), double ampersand ( && ), or double bar ( || ). The list is optionally ended by one of the following symbols: semicolon ( ; ), ampersand ( & ), or bar ampersand ( |& ). ; Sequentially processes the preceding pipeline. The shell carries out each command in turn and waits for the most recent command to complete. & Asynchronously processes the preceding pipeline. The shell carries out each command in turn, processing the pipeline in the background without waiting for it to complete. |& Asynchronously processes the preceding pipeline and establishes a two- way pipe to the parent shell. The shell carries out each command in turn, processing the pipeline in the background without waiting for it to complete. The parent shell can read from and write to the standard input and output of the created command by using the read -p and print -p commands. Only one such command can be active at any given time. && Processes the list that follows this symbol only if the preceding pipeline returns an exit value of zero (0). || Processes the list that follows this symbol only if the preceding pipeline returns a nonzero exit value. The semicolon ( ; ), ampersand ( & ), and bar ampersand ( |& ) have a lower priority than the double ampersand ( && ) and double bar ( || ). The ; , & , and |& symbols have equal priority among themselves. The && and || symbols are equal in priority. One or more newline characters can be used instead of a semicolon to delimit two commands in a list. Note: The |& symbol is valid only in the Korn shell. |

| metacharacter             | Each metacharacter has a special meaning to the shell and causes termination of a word unless it is quoted. Metacharacters are: pipe ( | ), ampersand ( & ), semicolon ( ; ), less-than sign ( < ), greater-than sign ( > ), left parenthesis ( ( ), right parenthesis ( ) ), dollar sign ( $ ), backquote ( ` ), backslash ( \ ), right quote ( ' ), double quotation marks ( " ), newline character, space character, and tab character. All characters enclosed between single quotation marks are considered quoted and are interpreted literally by the shell. The special meaning of metacharacters is retained if not quoted. (Metacharacters are also known as parser metacharacters in the C shell.)                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| parameter assignment list | Includes one or more words of the form Identi fi er=Value in which spaces surrounding the equal sign ( = ) must be balanced. That is, leading and trailing blanks, or no blanks, must be used. Note: In the C shell, the parameter assignment list is of the form set Identi fi er=Value . The spaces surrounding the equal sign ( = ) are required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| pipeline                  | A sequence of one or more commands separated by pipe ( | ). Each command in the pipeline, except possibly the last command, is run as a separate process. However, the standard output of each command that is connected by a pipe becomes the standard input of the next command in the sequence. If a list is enclosed with parentheses, it is carried out as a simple command that operates in a separate subshell. If the reserved word ! does not precede the pipeline, the exit status will be the exit status of the last command speci fi ed in the pipeline. Otherwise, the exit status is the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command. In other words, if the last command returns zero, the exit status will be 1 . If the last command returns greater than zero, the exit status will be zero. The format for a pipeline is as follows: [!] command1 [ | command2 ...] |
| shell variable            | A name or parameter to which a value is assigned. Assign a variable by typing the variable name, an equal sign ( = ), and then the value. The variable name can be substituted for the assigned value by preceding the variable name with a dollar sign ( $ ). Variables are particularly useful for creating a short notation for a long path name, such as $HOME for the home directory. A prede fi ned variable is one whose value is assigned by the shell. A user-de fi ned variable is one whose value is assigned by a user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| simple command            | A sequence of optional parameter assignment lists and redirections, in any sequence. They are optionally followed by commands, words, and redirections. They are terminated by ; , | , & , || , && , |& , or a newline character. The command name is passed as parameter 0 (as de fi ned by the exec subroutine). The value of a simple command is its exit status of zero if it terminates normally or nonzero if it terminates abnormally. The sigaction, sigvec, or signal subroutine includes a list of signal-exit status values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Specifying a shell for a script fi le

When you run an executable shell script in either the Korn (the POSIX Shell) or Bourne shell, the commands in the script are carried out under the control of the current shell (the shell from which the script is started) unless you specify a different shell. When you run an executable shell script in the C shell, the commands in the script are carried out under the control of the Bourne shell ( /usr/bin/bsh ) unless you specify a different shell.

You can run a shell script in a speci fi c shell by including the shell within the shell script.

To run an executable shell script under a speci fi c shell, type #! Path on the fi rst line of the shell script, and press Enter. The #! characters identify the fi le type. The Path variable speci fi es the path name of the shell from which to run the shell script.

For example, to run the bsh script in the Bourne shell, type the following:

- #!/usr/bin/bsh

When you precede a shell script fi le name with a shell command, the shell speci fi ed on the command line overrides any shell speci fi ed within the script fi le itself. Therefore, typing ksh myfile and pressing Enter runs the fi le named myfile under the control of the Korn shell, even if the fi rst line of myfile is #!/usr/bin/csh .

## Shell features

There are advantages to using the shell as an interface to the system.

The primary advantages of interfacing to the system through a shell are as follows:

## Â· Wildcard substitution in fi le names (pattern-matching)

Carries out commands on a group of fi les by specifying a pattern to match, rather than specifying an actual fi le name.

For more information, see:

- 'File name substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell' on page 227
- 'File name substitution in the Bourne shell' on page 260
- 'File name substitution in the C shell' on page 279

## Â· Background processing

Sets up lengthy tasks to run in the background, freeing the terminal for concurrent interactive processing.

For more information, see the bg command in the following:

- 'Job control in the Korn shell or POSIX shell' on page 243
- 'C shell built-in commands' on page 286

Note: The Bourne shell does not support job control.

## Â· Command aliasing

Gives an alias name to a command or phrase. When the shell encounters an alias on the command line or in a shell script, it substitutes the text to which the alias refers.

For more information, see:

- 'Command aliasing in the Korn shell or POSIX shell' on page 256
- 'Alias substitution in the C shell' on page 276

Note: The Bourne shell does not support command aliasing.

## Â· Command history

Records the commands you enter in a history fi le. You can use this fi le to easily access, modify, and reissue any listed command.

For more information, see the history command in the following:

- 'Korn shell or POSIX shell command history' on page 256
- 'C shell built-in commands' on page 286
- 'History substitution in the C shell' on page 297

Note: The Bourne shell does not support command history.

## Â· File name substitution

Automatically produces a list of fi le names on a command line using pattern-matching characters.

For more information, see:

- 'File name substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell' on page 227
- 'File name substitution in the Bourne shell' on page 260
- 'File name substitution in the C shell' on page 279

## Â· Input and output redirection

Redirects input away from the keyboard and redirects output to a fi le or device other than the terminal. For example, input to a program can be provided from a fi le and redirected to the printer or to another fi le.

For more information, see:

- 'Input and output redirection in the Korn shell or POSIX shell' on page 228
- 'Input and output redirection in the Bourne shell' on page 261
- 'Input and output redirection in the C shell' on page 299

## Â· Piping

Links any number of commands together to form a complex program. The standard output of one program becomes the standard input of the next.

For more information, see the pipeline de fi nition in 'Shells terminology' on page 201.

## Â· Shell variable substitution

Stores data in user-de fi ned variables and prede fi ned shell variables.

For more information, see:

- 'Parameter substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell' on page 225
- 'Variable substitution in the Bourne shell' on page 271
- 'Variable substitution in the C shell' on page 277

## Commands

Some commands can be entered simply by typing one word. It is also possible to combine commands so that the output from one command becomes the input for another command.

## Character classes

You can use character classes to match fi le names.

You can use character classes to match fi le names, as follows:

```
[[: charclass :]]
```

This format instructs the system to match any single character belonging to the speci fi ed class. The de fi ned classes correspond to ctype subroutines, as follows:

## Character Class

## De fi nition

alnum

Alphanumeric characters

Character Class

De fi nition

alpha

Uppercase and lowercase letters

blank

Space or horizontal tab

cntrl

Control characters

digit

Digits

graph

Graphic characters

lower

Lowercase letters

print

Printable characters

punct

Punctuation characters

space

Space, horizontal tab, carriage return, newline, vertical tab, or form-feed character

upper

Uppercase characters

xdigit

Hexadecimal digits

## Restricted shell

The restricted shell is used to set up login names and execution environments whose capabilities are more controlled than those of the regular Bourne shell.

The Rsh or bsh -r command opens the restricted shell. The behavior of these commands is identical to those of the bsh command, except that the following actions are not allowed:

- Changing the directory (with the cd command)
- Setting the value of PATH or SHELL variables
- Specifying path or command names containing a slash ( / )
- Redirecting output

If the restricted shell determines that a command to be run is a shell procedure, it uses the Bourne shell to run the command. In this way, it is possible to provide a user with shell procedures that access the full power of the Bourne shell while imposing a limited menu of commands. This situation assumes that the user does not have write and execute permissions in the same directory.

If the File [ Parameter ] parameter is speci fi ed when the Bourne shell is started, the shell runs the script fi le identi fi ed by the File parameter, including any parameters speci fi ed. The script fi le speci fi ed must have read permission. Any setuid and setgid settings for script fi les are ignored. The shell then reads the commands. If either the -c or -s flag is used, do not specify a script fi le.

When started with the Rsh command, the shell enforces restrictions after interpreting the .profile and /etc/environment fi les. Therefore, the writer of the .profile fi le has complete control over user actions by performing setup actions and leaving the user in an appropriate directory (probably not the login directory). An administrator can create a directory of commands in the /usr/rbin directory that the Rsh command can use by changing the PATH variable to contain the directory. If it is started with the bsh -r command, the shell applies restrictions when interpreting the .profile fi les.

When called with the name Rsh , the restricted shell reads the user's .profile fi le ( $HOME/.profile ). It acts as the regular Bourne shell while doing this, except that an interrupt causes an immediate exit instead of a return to command level.

The Korn shell can be started as a restricted shell with the command ksh -r .

The inodes for ksh and rksh are identical, and the inodes for ksh93 and rksh93 are identical.

## Creating and running a shell script

A shell script is a fi le that contains one or more commands. Shell scripts provide an easy way to carry out tedious commands, large or complicated sequences of commands, and routine tasks. When you enter the name of a shell script fi le, the system executes the command sequence contained by the fi le.

You can create a shell script by using a text editor. Your script can contain both operating system commands and shell built-in commands.

The following steps are general guidelines for writing shell scripts:

1. Using a text editor, create and save a fi le. You can include any combination of shell and operating system commands in the shell script fi le. By convention, shell scripts that are not set up for use by many users are stored in the $HOME/bin directory.

Note: The operating system does not support the setuid or setgid subroutines within a shell script.

2. Use the chmod command to allow only the owner to run (or execute) the fi le. For example, if your fi le is named script1 , type the following:
3. Type the script name on the command line to run the shell script. To run the script1 shell script, type the following:

```
chmod u=rwx script1
```

script1

Note: You can run a shell script without making it executable if a shell command ( ksh , bsh , or csh ) precedes the shell script fi le name on the command line. For example, to run a nonexecutable fi le named script1 under the control of the Korn shell, type the following:

```
ksh script1
```

## Commands

Some commands can be entered simply by typing one word. It is also possible to combine commands so that the output from one command becomes the input for another command.

## Korn shell

The Korn shell (ksh command) is backwardly compatible with the Bourne shell (bsh command) and contains most of the Bourne shell features as well as several of the best features of the C shell.

## Variables set by the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The following are variables that are set by the shell.

| CDPATH   | Indicates the search path for the cd (change directory) command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| COLUMNS  | De fi nes the width of the edit window for the shell edit modes and for printing select lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| EDITOR   | If the value of this parameter ends in emacs, gmacs, or vi, and the VISUAL variable is not set with the set special built-in command, then the corresponding option is turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ENV      | If this variable is set, then parameter substitution is performed on the value to generate the path name of the script that will be executed when the shell is invoked. This fi le is typically used for alias and function de fi nitions. This variable will be ignored for noninteractive shells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FCEDIT   | Speci fi es the default editor name for the fc regular built-in command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| FPATH    | Speci fi es the search path for function de fi nitions. This path is searched when a function with the -u flag is referenced and when a command is not found. If an executable fi le is found, then it is read and executed in the current environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| HISTFILE | If this variable is set when the shell is invoked, then the value is the path name of the fi le that will be used to store the command history. The initialization process for the history fi le can be dependent on the system start- up fi les because some start-up fi les can contain commands that effectively preempt the settings the user has speci fi ed for HISTFILE and HISTSIZE. For example, function de fi nition commands are recorded in the history fi le. If the system administrator includes function de fi nitions in a system start-up fi le that is called before the ENV fi le or before HISTFILE or HISTSIZE variable is set, the history fi le is initialized before the user can influence its characteristics. |
| HISTSIZE | If this variable is set when the shell is invoked, then the number of previously entered commands that are accessible by this shell will be greater than or equal to this number. The default is 128 commands for nonroot users and 512 commands for the root user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Item                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| HOME                  | Indicates the name of your login directory, which becomes the current directory upon completion of a login. The login program initializes this variable. The cd command uses the value of the $HOME parameter as its default value. Using this variable rather than an explicit path name in a shell procedure allows the procedure to be run from a different directory without alterations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| IFS                   | Speci fi es IFS (internal fi eld separators), which are normally space, tab, and newline, used to separate command words that result from command or parameter substitution and for separating words with the regular built-in command read . The fi rst character of the IFS parameter is used to separate arguments for the $* substitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| KSH_CHOWN_M B_SUPPORT | If the language ( LANG ) variable is changed inside the Korn shell (ksh) script, by default the ksh script ignores the LC_CTYPE variable. Therefore, the wildcard (*) expansion fails for few locales. To solve this issue, you can export the KSH_CHOWN_MB_SUPPORT environment variable by using the following command: export KSH_CHOWN_MB_SUPPORT=ON You can turn off the KSH_CHOWN_MB_SUPPORT environment variable by using the following command:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| KSH_STAK_SIZE         | Increases the internal stack size of the Korn shell (ksh). By default, the size of the internal stack is 16 KB. To increase the size of the internal stack to process large fi les, use the KSH_STAK_SIZE environment variable. The values of the KSH_STAK_SIZE environment variable must be in the range 32 KB - 64 MB. The following examples show the format that you must use to specify the KSH_STAK_SIZE environment variable: â¢ To increase the size of the internal stack to 1 MB, type the following command: export KSH_STAK_SIZE=1MB â¢ To increase the size of the internal stack to 30 KB, type the following command: export KSH_STAK_SIZE=30KB Although you want to increase the internal stack size to 30 KB, the KSH_STAK_SIZE environment variable rounds off the value to 32 KB because the KSH_STAK_SIZE environment variable must be in the range 32 KB - 64 MB. |

| MAIL         | Speci fi es the fi le path name used by the mail system to detect the arrival of new mail. If this variable is set to the name of a mail fi le and the MAILPATH variable is not set, then the shell informs the user of new mail in the speci fi ed fi le.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MAILCHECK    | Speci fi es how often (in seconds) the shell checks for changes in the modi fi cation time of any of the fi les speci fi ed by the MAILPATH or MAIL variables. The default value is 600 seconds. When the time has elapsed, the shell checks before issuing the next prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| MAILPATH     | Speci fi es a list of fi le names separated by colons. If this variable is set, then the shell informs the user of any modi fi cations to the speci fi ed fi les that have occurred during the period, in seconds, speci fi ed by the MAILCHECK variable. Each fi le name can be followed by a ? and a message that will be printed. The message will undergo variable substitution with the $_ variable de fi ned as the name of the fi le that has changed. The default message is you have mail in $_ . |

| SHELL PROMPT | When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of the PS1 parameter before reading a command. If at any time a new line is entered and the shell requires further input to complete a command, the shell issues the secondary prompt (the value of the PS2 parameter).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| TMOUT        | Speci fi es the number of seconds a shell waits inactive before exiting. If the TMOUT variable is set to a value greater than zero (0), the shell exits if a command is not entered within the prescribed number of seconds after issuing the PS1 prompt. (Note that the shell can be compiled with a maximum boundary that cannot be exceeded for this value.) Note: After the timeout period has expired, there is a 60-second pause before the shell exits.                                             |
| VISUAL       | If the value of this variable ends in emacs, gmacs, or vi, then the corresponding option is turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The shell gives default values to the PATH , PS1 , PS2 , MAILCHECK , TMOUT , and IFS parameters, but the HOME , SHELL , ENV , and MAIL parameters are not set by the shell (although the HOME parameter is set by the login command).

## Command substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn Shell, or POSIX Shell, lets you perform command substitution. In command substitution, the shell executes a speci fi ed command in a subshell environment and replaces that command with its output.

To execute command substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell, type the following:

```
$(command) or, for the backquoted version, type the following: `command`
```

Note: Although the backquote syntax is accepted by ksh , it is considered obsolete by the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4 and POSIX standards. These standards recommend that portable applications use the $(command) syntax.

The shell expands the command substitution by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution (the text of command plus the enclosing $( ) or backquotes) with the standard output of the command, removing sequences of one or more newline characters at the end of the substitution.

In the following example, the $( ) surrounding the command indicates that the output of the whoami command is substituted:

echo My name is: $(whoami) You can perform the same command substitution with: echo My name is: `whoami` The output from both examples for user dee is: My name is: dee You can also substitute arithmetic expressions by enclosing them in ( ) . For example, the command: echo Each hour contains $((60 * 60)) seconds produces the following result: Each hour contains 3600 seconds The Korn shell or POSIX shell removes all trailing newline characters when performing command substitution. For example, if your current directory contains the file1 , file2 , and file3 fi les, the command:

```
echo $(ls) removes the newline characters and produces the following output: file1 file2 file3 To preserve newline characters, insert the substituted command in " " : echo "$(ls)"
```

## Arithmetic evaluation in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn shell or POSIX shell regular built-in let command enables you to perform integer arithmetic.

Constants are of the form [ Base ] Number . The Base parameter is a decimal number between 2 and 36 inclusive, representing the arithmetic base. The Number parameter is a number in that base. If you omit the Base parameter, the shell uses a base of 10.

Arithmetic expressions use the same syntax, precedence, and associativity of expression as the C programming language. All of the integral operators, other than double plus ( ++ ), double hyphen ( -), question mark-colon ( ?: ), and comma ( , ), are supported. The following table lists valid Korn shell or POSIX shell operators in decreasing order of precedence:

| Operator                                           | De fi nition            |

| !                                                  | Logical negation        |
| ~                                                  | Bitwise negation        |
| *                                                  | Multiplication          |

| %                                                  | Remainder               |
| +                                                  | Addition                |
| -                                                  | Subtraction             |
| << , >>                                            | Left shift, right shift |
| <= , >= , <> , == , !=                             | Comparison              |

| ^                                                  | Bitwise exclusive OR    |
| |                                                  | Bitwise OR              |
| &&                                                 | Logical AND             |
| ||                                                 | Logical OR              |
| = *= , /= , &= += , -= , <<= , > >= , &= , ^= , |= | Assignment              |

Many arithmetic operators, such as * , &amp; , &lt; , and &gt; , have special meaning to the Korn shell or POSIX shell. These characters must be quoted. For example, to multiply the current value of y by 5 and reassign the new value to y , use the expression:

```
let "y = y * 5"
```

Enclosing the expression in quotation marks removes the special meaning of the * character.

You can group operations inside let command expressions to force grouping. For example, in the expression:

```
let "z = q * (z -10)"
```

the command multiplies q by the reduced value of z .

The Korn shell or POSIX shell includes an alternative form of the let command if only a single expression is to be evaluated. The shell treats commands enclosed in (( )) as quoted expressions. Therefore, the expression:

```
((x = x / 3)) is equivalent to: let "x = x / 3"
```

Named parameters are referenced by name within an arithmetic expression without using the parameter substitution syntax. When a named parameter is referenced, its value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.

Specify an internal integer representation of a named parameter with the -i flag of the typeset special built-in command. Using the -i flag, arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each assignment to a named parameter. If you do not specify an arithmetic base, the fi rst assignment to the parameter determines the arithmetic base. This base is used when parameter substitution occurs.

## Field splitting in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

After performing command substitution, the Korn shell scans the results of substitutions for those fi eld separator characters found in the IFS (Internal Field Separator) variable. Where such characters are found, the shell splits the substitutions into distinct arguments.

The shell retains explicit null arguments ( "" or '' ) and removes implicit null arguments (those resulting from parameters that have no values).

- If the value of IFS is a space, tab, or newline character, or if it is not set, any sequence of space, tab, or newline characters at the beginning or end of the input will be ignored and any sequence of those characters within the input will delimit a fi eld. For example, the following input yields two fi elds, school and days :

&lt;newline&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;school&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;days&lt;space&gt;

- Otherwise, and if the value of IFS is not null, the following rules apply in sequence. IFS white space is used to mean any sequence (zero or more instances) of white-space characters that are in the IFS value (for example, if IFS contains space/comma/tab, any sequence of space and tab characters is considered IFS white space).
1. IFS white space is ignored at the beginning and end of the input.
2. Each occurrence in the input of an IFS character that is not IFS white space, along with any adjacent IFS white space, delimits a fi eld.
3. Nonzero length IFS white space delimits a fi eld.

Special commands are built in to the Korn shell and POSIX shell and executed in the shell process.

## Conditional expressions for the Korn shell or POSIX shell

A conditional expression is used with the [[ compound command to test attributes of fi les and to compare strings.

Word splitting and fi le name substitution are not performed on words appearing between [[ and ]] . Each expression is constructed from one or more of the following unary or binary expressions:

Note: In each of the previous expressions, if the File variable is similar to /dev/fd/ n , where n is an integer, then the test is applied to the open fi le whose descriptor number is n .

You can construct a compound expression from these primitives, or smaller parts, by using any of the following expressions, listed in decreasing order of precedence:

## Item

## Description

| ( Expression )             | True, if the speci fi ed expression is true. Used to group expressions.   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ! Expression               | True, if the speci fi ed expression is false.                             |
| Expression1 && Expression2 | True, if Expression1 and Expression2 are both true.                       |
| Expression1 || Expression2 | True, if either Expression1 or Expression2 is true.                       |

## Quotation of characters in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

When you want the Korn shell or POSIX shell to read a character as a regular character, rather than with any normally associated meaning, you must quote it.

Each metacharacter has a special meaning to the shell and, unless quoted, causes termination of a word. The following characters are considered metacharacters by the Korn shell or POSIX shell and must be quoted if they are to represent themselves:

- pipe ( | )
- ampersand ( &amp; )
- semicolon ( ; )
- less-than sign ( &lt; ) and greater-than sign ( &gt; )
- left parenthesis ( ( ) and right parenthesis ( ) )
- dollar sign ( $ )
- backquote ( ` ) and single quotation mark ( ' )

- backslash ( \ )
- double-quotation marks ( " )
- newline character
- space character
- tab character

To negate the special meaning of a metacharacter, use one of the quoting mechanisms in the following list.

| Item                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Backslash              | A backslash ( \ ) that is not quoted preserves the literal value of the following character, with the exception of a newline character. If a newline character follows the backslash, then the shell interprets this as line continuation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Single Quotation Marks | Enclosing characters in single quotation marks ( ' ' ) preserves the literal value of each character within the single quotation marks. A single quotation mark cannot occur within single quotation marks. A backslash cannot be used to escape a single quotation mark in a string that is set in single quotation marks. An embedded quotation mark can be created by writing, for example: 'a'\''b' , which yields a'b .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Double Quotation Marks | Enclosing characters in double quotation marks ( " " ) preserves the literal value of all characters within the double quotation marks, with the exception of the dollar sign, backquote, and backslash characters, as follows: $ The dollar sign retains its special meaning introducing parameter expansion, a form of command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. The input characters within the quoted string that are also enclosed between $( and the matching ) will not be affected by the double quotation marks, but de fi ne that command whose output replaces the $(...) when the word is expanded. Within the string of characters from an enclosed ${ to the matching } , there must be an even number of unescaped double quotation marks or single quotation marks, if any. A preceding backslash character must be used to escape a literal { or } . ` The backquote retains its special meaning introducing the other form of command substitution. The portion of the quoted string, from the initial backquote and the characters up to the next backquote that is not preceded by a backslash, de fi nes that command whose output replaces ` ... ` when the word is expanded. \ The backslash retains its special meaning as an escape character only when followed by one of the following characters: $ , ` , " , \ , or a newline character. |

A double quotation mark must be preceded by a backslash to be included within double quotation marks. When you use double quotation marks, if a backslash is immediately followed by a character that would

be interpreted as having a special meaning, the backslash is deleted, and the subsequent character is taken literally. If a backslash does not precede a character that would have a special meaning, it is left in place unchanged, and the character immediately following it is also left unchanged. For example:

```
"\$" -> $ "\a" -> \a
```

The following conditions apply to metacharacters and quoting characters in the Korn or POSIX shell:

- The meanings of dollar sign, asterisk ( $* ) and dollar sign, at symbol ( $@ ) are identical when not quoted, when used as a parameter assignment value, or when used as a fi le name.
- When used as a command argument, double quotation marks, dollar sign, asterisk, double quotation marks ( "$*" ) is equivalent to "$1 d $2 d ..." , where d is the fi rst character of the IFS parameter.
- Double quotation marks, at symbol, asterisk, double quotation marks ( "$@" ) are equivalent to "$1" "$2" ... .
- Inside backquotes ( `` ), the backslash quotes the characters backslash ( \ ), single quotation mark ( ' ), and dollar sign ( $ ). If the backquotes occur within double quotation marks ( " " ), the backslash also quotes the double quotation marks character.
- Parameter and command substitution occurs inside double quotation marks ( " " ).
- The special meaning of reserved words or aliases is removed by quoting any character of the reserved word. You cannot quote function names or built-in command names.

## Restricted Korn shell

The Restricted Korn Shell is used to set up login names and execution environments whose capabilities are more controlled than those of the regular Korn shell.

The rksh or ksh -r command opens the Restricted Korn Shell. The behavior of these commands is identical to those of the ksh command, except that the following actions are not allowed:

- Change the current working directory
- Set the value of the SHELL , ENV , or PATH variables
- Specify the pathname of a command containing a / (slash)
- Redirect output of a command with &gt; (right caret), &gt;| (right caret, pipe symbol), &lt;&gt; (left caret, right caret), or &gt;&gt; (two right carets).

If the Restricted Korn Shell determines that a command to be run is a shell procedure, it uses the Korn shell to run the command. In this way, it is possible to provide an end user with shell procedures that access the full power of the Korn shell while imposing a limited menu of commands. This situation assumes that the user does not have write and execute permissions in the same directory.

If the File [ Parameter ] parameter is speci fi ed when the Korn shell is started, the shell runs the script fi le identi fi ed by the File parameter, including any parameters speci fi ed. The script fi le speci fi ed must have read permission. Any setuid and setgid settings for script fi les are ignored. The shell then reads the commands. If either the -c or -s flag is used, do not specify a script fi le.

When started with the rksh command, the shell enforces restrictions after interpreting the .profile and /etc/environment fi les. Therefore, the writer of the .profile fi le has complete control over user actions by performing setup actions and leaving the user in an appropriate directory (probably not the login directory). An administrator can create a directory of commands in the /usr/rbin directory that the rksh command can use by changing the PATH variable to contain the directory. If it is started with the ksh -r command, the shell applies restrictions when interpreting the .profile fi les.

When called with the rksh command, the Restricted Korn Shell reads the user's .profile fi le ( $HOME/.profile ). It acts as the regular Korn shell while doing this, except that an interrupt causes an immediate exit instead of a return to command level.

## Reserved words in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The following reserved words have special meaning to the Korn shell or POSIX shell.

| !        | case   | do   |
|----------|--------|------|
| done     | elif   | else |
| esac     | fi     | for  |
| function | if     | in   |
| select   | then   | time |
| until    | while  | {    |
| }        | [[     | ]]   |

The reserved words are recognized only when they appear without quotation marks and when the word is used as the following:

- First word of a command
- First word following one of the reserved words other than case , for , or in
- Third word in a case or for command (only in is valid in this case)

## Enhanced Korn shell (ksh93)

In addition to the default system Korn shell ( /usr/bin/ksh ), AIX provides an enhanced version available as Korn shell /usr/bin/ksh93 . This enhanced version is mostly upwardly compatible with the current default version, and includes a few additional features that are not available in Korn shell /usr/bin/ksh .

Some scripts might perform differently under Korn shell ksh93 than under the default shell because variable handling is somewhat different under the two shells.

Note: There is also a restricted version of the enhanced Korn shell available, called rksh93 .

The following features are not available in Korn shell /usr/bin/ksh , but are available in Korn shell /usr/bin/ksh93 :

| Item                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arithmetic enhancements | You can use libm functions (math functions typically found in the C programming language), within arithmetic expressions, such as $ value=$((sqrt(9))) . More arithmetic operators are available, including the unary + , ++ , -- , and the ?: construct (for example, " x ? y : z "), as well as the , (comma) operator. Arithmetic bases are supported up to base 64. Floating point arithmetic is also supported. " typeset -E " (exponential) can be used to specify the number of signi fi cant digits and " typeset -F " (float) can be used to specify the number of decimal places for an arithmetic variable. The SECONDS variable now displays to the nearest hundredth of a second, rather than to the nearest second. |
| Compound variables      | Compound variables are supported. A compound variable allows a user to specify multiple values within a single variable name. The values are each assigned with a subscript variable, separated from the parent variable with a period ( . ). For example: $ myvar=( x=1 y=2 ) $ print "${myvar.x}" 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Compound assignments    | Compound assignments are supported when initializing arrays, both for indexed arrays and associative arrays. The assignment values are placed in parentheses, as shown in the following example: $ numbers=( zero one two three ) $ print ${numbers[0]} ${numbers[3]} zero three                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Associative arrays       | An associative array is an array with a string as an index. The typeset command used with the -A flag allows you to specify associative arrays within ksh93. For example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Variable name references | The typeset command used with the -n flag allows you to assign one variable name as a reference to another. In this way, modifying the value of a variable will in turn modify the value of the variable that is referenced. For example: $ greeting="hello" $ typeset -n welcome=greeting # establishes the reference $ welcome="hi there" # overrides previous value $ print $greeting hi there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Parameter expansions     | The following parameter-expansion constructs are available: â¢ ${!varname} is the name of the variable itself. â¢ ${! varname [@]} names the indexes for the varname array. â¢ ${ param : offset } is a substring of param , starting at offset . â¢ ${param:offset:num} is a substring of param , starting at offset , for num number of characters. â¢ ${@: offset } indicates all positional parameters starting at offset . â¢ ${@: offset : num } indicates num positional parameters starting at offset . â¢ ${ param / pattern / repl } evaluates to param , with the fi rst occurrence of pattern replaced by repl . â¢ ${ param // pattern / repl } evaluates to param , with every occurrence of pattern replaced by repl . â¢ ${ param / #pattern / repl } if param begins with pattern , then param is replaced by repl . â¢ ${ param /% pattern / repl } if param ends with pattern , then param is replaced by repl . |

## Description

| Discipline functions   | A discipline function is a function that is associated with a speci fi c variable. This allows you to de fi ne and call a function every time that variable is referenced, set, or unset. These functions take the form of varname.function , where varname is the name of the variable and function is the discipline function. The prede fi ned discipline functions are get , set , and unset .   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                        | â¢ The varname .get function is invoked every time varname is referenced. If the special variable .sh.value is set within this function, then the value of varname is changed to this value. A simple example is the time of day:                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                        | $ function time.get > { > .sh.value=$(date +%r) > } $ print $time 09:15:58 AM $ print $time # it will change in a few seconds 09:16:04 AM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                        | â¢ The varname .set function is invoked every time varname is set. The .sh.value variable is given the value that was assigned. The value assigned to varname is the value of .sh.value when the function completes. For example:                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                        | $ function adder.set > { > let .sh.value=" $ {.sh.value} + 1" > } $ adder=0 $ echo $adder 1 $ adder=$adder $ echo $adder 2 â¢ The varname .unset function is executed every time varname is unset. The variable                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Function environments  | Functions declared with the function myfunc format are run in a separate function environment and support local variables. Functions declared as myfunc () run with the same environment as the parent shell.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Variables              | Variables beginning with .sh. are reserved by the shell and have special meaning. See the description of Discipline Functions in this table for an explanation of .sh.name , .sh.value , and .sh.subscript . Also available is .sh.version , which represents the version of the shell.                                                                                                              |
| Command return values  | Return values of commands are as follows: â¢ If the command to be executed is not found, the return value is set to 127. â¢ If the command to be executed is found, but not executable, the return value is 126. â¢ If the command is executed, but is terminated by a signal, the return value is 256 plus the signal number.                                                                          |
| PATH search rules      | Special built-in commands are searched for fi rst, followed by all functions (including those in FPATH directories), followed by other built-ins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Shell history     | The hist command allows you to display and edit the shells command history. In the ksh shell, the fc command was used. The fc command is an alias to hist . Variables are HISTCMD , which increments once for each command executed in the shells current history, and HISTEDIT , which speci fi es which editor to use when using the hist command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Built-in commands | The enhanced Korn shell contains the following built-in commands: â¢ The builtin command lists all available built-in commands. â¢ The printf command works in a similar manner as the printf() C library routine. See the printf command. â¢ The disown blocks the shell from sending a SIGHUP to the speci fi ed command. â¢ The getconf command works in the same way as the stand-alone command /usr/bin/getconf . See the getconf command. â¢ The read built-in command has the following flags: - read -d { char } allows you to specify a character delimiter instead of the default newline. - read -t { seconds } allows you to specify a time limit, in seconds, after which the read command will time out. If read times out, it will return FALSE . â¢ The exec built-in command has the following flags: - exec -a { name } { cmd } speci fi es that argument 0 of cmd be replaced with name - exec -c { cmd } tells exec to clear the environment before executing cmd . â¢ The kill built-in command has the following flags: - kill -n { signum } is used for specifying a signal number to send to a process, while kill -s { signame } is used to specify a signal name. - kill -l , with no arguments, lists all signal names but not their numbers. â¢ The whence built-in command has the following flags: - The -a flag displays all matches, not only the fi rst one found. - The -f flag tells whence not to search for any functions. â¢ An escape character sequence is used for use by the print and echo commands. The Esc (Escape) key can be represented by the sequence \E . â¢ All regular built-in commands recognize the -? flag, which shows the syntax for the speci fi ed command. â¢ The getopts built-in requires optstring to contain a leading + to allow options |

| Audit support | To enable the auditing feature in the enhanced Korn shell, complete the following steps:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|               | â¢ To enable the auditing feature in the ksh93u command, the /etc/ksh_audit fi le must have an output fi lename an identi fi cation value for the user. For example, /tmp/ ksh_auditfile;205;0 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|               | â¢ You can con fi gure the auditing feature to generate a detailed record for every executable command. You can use the record to monitor, track, and audit activities for one or more users on a system, including the system administrators.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|               | â¢ To enable the auditing feature in the ksh93 command, the fi le /etc/ksh_audit must be created and con fi gured by specifying the location of the audit_log fi le and an identi fi cation value for the user. You can separate the identi fi cation values by using a semicolon.                                                                                                                                                             |
|               | For example, the text /tmp/ksh_audit fi le;0;100;205 in the /etc/ksh_audit fi le refers to the location of the log fi le ( /tmp/ksh_auditfile ), and the user identi fi cation values which are, 0 (root) , 100 , and 205 respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|               | â¢ The users awaiting audit must have Read and Write permissions for the con fi guration and log fi les.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|               | â¢ When the EXTENDED_HISTORY environment variable is switched on, the audit entries will have a timestamp information with non-printable characters at the end of the entry. By default, the EXTENDED_HISTORY environment variable is turned on. However, you can manually turn it on by running the export EXTENDED_HISTORY=ON command. To disable the EXTENDED_HISTORY environment variable, you can run the unset EXTENDED_HISTORY command. |
|               | â¢ The EXTENDED_HISTORY environment variable allows you to view a detailed tracking report for all commands that are executed in the shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| ksh93                                 | â¢ With Korn shell ksh93, a dollar sign followed by a single quote ( $' ) is interpreted as an ANSI C string. You must quote the dollar sign ( \"$\"' ) to get the old (ksh) behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                                       | â¢ Argument parsing logic for Korn shell ksh93 built-in commands has been changed. The undocumented combinations of argument parsing to Korn shell ksh built-in commands do not work in Korn shell ksh93. For example, typeset -4i works similar to typeset -i4 in Korn shell ksh, but does not work in Korn shell ksh93.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                       | â¢ With Korn shell ksh93, command substitution and arithmetic expansion is performed on special environment variables PS1, PS3, and ENV while expanding. Therefore, you must escape the grave symbol ( ` ) and the dollar sign and opening parenthesis symbols ( $( ) using a backslash ( \ ) to retain the old behavior. For example, Korn shell ksh literally assigns x= $' name \t operator ' as $ name \t operator ; Korn shell ksh93 expands \t and assigns it as name <\t expanded> operator . To preserve the Korn shell ksh behavior, you must quote $ . For example, x="$"' name \t operator ' . |

## Exit status in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors, cause the shell to return a nonzero exit status. Otherwise, the shell returns the exit status of the last command carried out.

The shell reports detected runtime errors by printing the command or function name and the error condition. If the number of the line on which an error occurred is greater than 1, then the line number is also printed in [ ] (brackets) after the command or function name.

For a noninteractive shell, an error encountered by a special built-in or other type of command will cause the shell to write a diagnostic message as shown in the following table:

| Error                                          | Special Built-In   | Other Utilities   |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Shell language syntax error                    | will exit          | will exit         |
| Utility syntax error (option or operand error) | will exit          | will not exit     |
| Redirection error                              | will exit          | will not exit     |
| Variable assignment error                      | will exit          | will not exit     |

| Error                | Special Built-In   | Other Utilities   |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Expansion error      | will exit          | will exit         |
| Command not found    | not applicable     | may exit          |
| Dot script not found | will exit          | not applicable    |

If any of the errors shown as "will (may) exit" occur in a subshell, the subshell will (may) exit with a nonzero status, but the script containing the subshell will not exit because of the error.

In all cases shown in the table, an interactive shell will write a diagnostic message to standard error, without exiting.

## Parameters in the Korn shell

Korn shell parameters are discussed below.

A parameter is de fi ned as the following:

- Identi fi er of any of the characters asterisk ( * ), at sign ( @ ), pound sign ( # ), question mark ( ? ), hyphen ( -), dollar sign ( $ ), and exclamation point ( ! ). These are called special parameters .
- Argument denoted by a number ( positional parameter )
- Parameter denoted by an identi fi er, with a value and zero or more attributes ( named parameter/ variables ).

The typeset special built-in command assigns values and attributes to named parameters. The attributes supported by the Korn shell are described with the typeset special built-in command. Exported parameters pass values and attributes to the environment.

The value of a named parameter is assigned by:

```
Name=Value [ Name=Value ] ...
```

If the -i integer attribute is set for the Name parameter, then the Value parameter is subject to arithmetic evaluation.

The shell supports a one-dimensional array facility. An element of an array parameter is referenced by a subscript. A subscript is denoted by an arithmetic expression enclosed by brackets [ ] . To assign values to an array, use set -A Name Value ... . The value of all subscripts must be in the range of 0 through 511. Arrays need not be declared. Any reference to a named parameter with a valid subscript is legal and an array will be created, if necessary. Referencing an array without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the element 0.

Positional parameters are assigned values with the set special command. The $0 parameter is set from argument 0 when the shell is invoked. The $ character is used to introduce parameters that can be substituted.

## Shell startup

You can start the Korn shell with the ksh command, psh command (POSIX shell), or the exec command.

## Korn shell functions

The function reserved word de fi nes shell functions. The shell reads and stores functions internally. Alias names are resolved when the function is read. The shell executes functions in the same manner as commands, with the arguments passed as positional parameters.

## Arithmetic evaluation in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn shell or POSIX shell regular built-in let command enables you to perform integer arithmetic.

Korn shell compound commands

A compound command can be a list of simple commands or a pipeline, or it can begin with a reserved word. Most of the time, you will use compound commands such as if , while , and for when you are writing shell scripts.

Parameter substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, lets you perform parameter substitutions.

The following are substitutable parameters:

| @      | Expands the positional parameters, beginning with $1 . Each parameter is separated by a space. If you place " around $@ , the shell considers each positional parameter a separate string. If no positional parameters exist, the shell expands the statement to an unquoted null string.                                                             |
| *      | Expands the positional parameters, beginning with $1 . The shell separates each parameter with the fi rst character of the IFS parameter value. If you place " around $* , the shell includes the positional parameter values in double quotation marks. Each value is separated by the fi rst character of the IFS parameter.                        |
| #      | Speci fi es the number (in decimals) of positional parameters passed to the shell, not counting the name of the shell procedure itself. The $# parameter thus yields the number of the highest-numbered positional parameter that is set. One of the primary uses of this parameter is to check for the presence of the required number of arguments. |

| ?      | Speci fi es the exit value of the last command executed. Its value is a decimal string. Most commands return 0 to indicate successful completion.

## File name substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, performs fi le name substitution by scanning each command word speci fi ed by the Word variable for certain characters.

If a command word includes the *) , ? or [ characters, and the -f flag has not been set, the shell regards the word as a pattern. The shell replaces the word with fi le names, sorted according to the collating sequence in effect in the current locale, that match that pattern. If the shell does not fi nd a fi le name to match the pattern, it does not change the word.

When the shell uses a pattern for fi le name substitution, the . and / characters must be matched explicitly.

Note: The Korn shell does not treat these characters specially in other instances of pattern matching.

These pattern-matching characters indicate the following substitutions:

| [ ... ] | Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated by a hyphen ( - ) matches any character lexically within the inclusive range of that pair, according to the collating sequence in effect in the current locale. If the fi rst character following the opening [ is ! , then any character not enclosed is matched. A hyphen ( - ) can be included in the character set by putting it as the fi rst or last character. |

You can also use the [:charclass:] notation to match fi le names within a range indication. This format instructs the system to match any single character belonging to class . The de fi nition of which characters constitute a speci fi c character class is present through the LC\_CTYPE category of the setlocale subroutine. All character classes speci fi ed in the current locale are recognized.

The names of some of the character classes are as follows:

- alnum
- alpha
- cntrl
- digit
- graph
- lower
- print
- punct

- space
- upper
- xdigit

For example, [[:upper:]] matches any uppercase letter.

The Korn shell supports fi le name expansion based on collating elements, symbols, or equivalence classes.

A PatternList is a list of one or more patterns separated from each other with a | . Composite patterns are formed with one or more of the following:

| Item             | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ?( PatternList ) | Optionally matches any one of the given patterns       |
| *( PatternList ) | Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns |
| +( PatternList ) | Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns  |
| @( PatternList ) | Matches exactly one of the given patterns              |
| !( PatternList ) | Matches anything, except one of the given patterns     |

Pattern matching has some restrictions. If the fi rst character of a fi le name is a dot ( . ), it can be matched only by a pattern that also begins with a dot. For example, * matches the fi le names myfile and yourfile but not the fi le names .myfile and .yourfile . To match these fi les, use a pattern such as the following:

.*file

If a pattern does not match any fi le names, then the pattern itself is returned as the result of the attempted match.

File and directory names should not contain the characters * , ? , [ , or ] because they can cause in fi nite recursion (that is, in fi nite loops) during pattern-matching attempts.

## Quote removal

Some characters will be removed if they are not quoted.

The quote characters, backslash ( \ ), single quote ( ' ), and double quote ( " ) that were present in the original word will be removed unless they have themselves been quoted.

## Input and output redirection in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

Before the Korn shell executes a command, it scans the command line for redirection characters. These special notations direct the shell to redirect input and output.

Redirection characters can appear anywhere in a simple command or can precede or follow a command. They are not passed on to the invoked command.

The shell performs command and parameter substitution before using the Word or Digit parameter except as noted. File name substitution occurs only if the pattern matches a single fi le and blank interpretation is not performed.

| << [ - ] Word | Reads each line of shell input until it locates a line containing only the value of the Word parameter or an end-of- fi le character. The shell does not perform parameter substitution, command substitution, or fi le name substitution on the fi le speci fi ed. The resulting document, called a here document, becomes the standard input. If any character of the Word parameter is quoted, no interpretation is placed upon the characters of the document.                                                                                        |

The here document is treated as a single word that begins after the next newline character and continues until there is a line containing only the delimiter, with no trailing blank characters. Then the next here document, if any, starts. The format is as follows:

[n]&lt;&lt;word here document delimiter

If any character in word is quoted, the delimiter is formed by removing the quote on word . The here document lines will not be expanded. Otherwise, the delimiter is the word itself. If no characters in word are quoted, all lines of the here document will be expanded for parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

The shell performs parameter substitution for the redirected data. To prevent the shell from interpreting the \ , $ , and single quotation mark ( ' ) characters and the fi rst character of the Word parameter, precede the characters with a \ character.

If a hyphen ( -) is appended to &lt;&lt; , the shell strips all leading tabs from the Word parameter and the document.

If one of these redirection options is preceded by a digit, then the fi le descriptor number referred to is speci fi ed by the digit (instead of the default 0 or 1). In the following example, the shell opens fi le descriptor 2 for writing as a duplicate of fi le descriptor 1:

```
... 2>&1
```

The order in which redirections are speci fi ed is signi fi cant. The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the ( FileDescriptor , File ) association at the time of evaluation. For example, in the statement:

```
... 1>File 2>&1
```

the fi le descriptor 1 is associated with the fi le speci fi ed by the File parameter. The shell associates fi le descriptor 2 with the fi le associated with fi le descriptor 1 ( File ). If the order of redirections were reversed, fi le descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming fi le descriptor 1 had previously been) and fi le descriptor 1 would be associated with the fi le speci fi ed by the File parameter.

If a command is followed by an ampersand ( &amp; ) and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty fi le /dev/null . Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the fi le descriptors of the invoking shell as modi fi ed by input and output speci fi cations.

## Coprocess facility

The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, allows you to run one or more commands as background processes. These commands, run from within a shell script, are called coprocesses .

Designate a coprocess by placing the |&amp; operator after a command. Both standard input and output of the command are piped to your script.

A coprocess must meet the following restrictions:

- Include a newline character at the end of each message
- Send each output message to standard output
- Clear its standard output after each message

The following example demonstrates how input is passed to and returned from a coprocess:

```
echo "Initial process" ./FileB.sh |& read -p a b c d echo "Read from coprocess: $a $b $c $d" print -p "Passed to the coprocess" read -p a b c d echo "Passed back from coprocess: $a $b $c $d"
```

```
FileB.sh echo "The coprocess is running" read a b c d echo $a $b $c $d
```

The resulting standard output is as follows:

```
Initial process Read from coprocess: The coprocess is running Passed back from coprocess: Passed to the coprocess
```

Use the print -p command to write to the coprocess. Use the read -p command to read from the coprocess.

## Korn shell or POSIX shell commands

The Korn shell is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language. It conforms to the Portable Operating System Interface for Computer Environments (POSIX), an international standard for operating systems.

Redirection of coprocess input and output

The standard input and output of a coprocess is reassigned to a numbered fi le descriptor by using I/O redirection.

For example, the command:

```
exec 5>&p
```

moves the input of the coprocess to fi le descriptor 5 .

After this coprocess has completed, you can use standard redirection syntax to redirect command output to the coprocess. You can also start another coprocess. Output from both coprocesses is connected to the same pipe and is read with the read -p command. To stop the coprocess, type the following:

```
read -u5
```

## Korn shell or POSIX shell built-in commands

Special commands are built in to the Korn shell and POSIX shell and executed in the shell process.

Unless otherwise indicated, the output is written to fi le descriptor 1 and the exit status is zero (0) if the command does not contain any syntax errors. Input and output redirection is permitted. There are two types of built-in commands: special built-in commands and regular built-in commands .

Special built-in commands differ from regular built-in commands in the following ways:

- A syntax error in a special built-in command might cause the shell executing the command to end. This does not happen if you have a syntax error in a regular built-in command. If a syntax error in a special built-in command does not end the shell program, the exit value is nonzero.
- Variable assignments speci fi ed with special built-in commands remain in effect after the command completes.
- I/O redirections are processed after parameter assignments.

In addition, words that are in the form of a parameter assignment following the export , readonly , and typeset special commands are expanded with the same rules as a parameter assignment. Tilde substitution is performed after the = , and word-splitting and fi le name substitution are not performed.

| exec [ Argument ...]   | Executes the command speci fi ed by the argument in place of this shell (without creating a new process). Input and output arguments can appear and affect the current process. If you do not specify an argument, the exec command modi fi es fi le descriptors as prescribed by the input and output redirection list. In this case, any fi le descriptor numbers greater than 2 that are opened with this mechanism are closed when invoking another program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| exit [ n ]             | Exits the shell with the exit status speci fi ed by the n parameter. The n parameter must be an unsigned decimal integer with range 0-255. If you omit the n parameter, the exit status is that of the most recent command executed. An end-of- fi le character also exits the shell unless the ignoreeof option of the set special command is turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| export -p [ Name [ = Value ]] ...   | Marks the speci fi ed names for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands. -p writes to standard output the names and values of all exported variables, in the following format: "export %s= %s\n", <name> <value>                                                                         |
| newgrp [ Group ]                    | Equivalent to the exec/usr/bin/newgrp [ Group ] command. Note: This command does not return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| readonly -p [ Name [ = Value ]] ... | Marks the names speci fi ed by the Name parameter as read-only. These names cannot be changed by subsequent assignment. -p writes to standard output the names and values of all exported variables, in the following format: "export %s= %s\n", <name> <value>                                                        |
| return [ n ]                        | Causes a shell function to return to the invoking script. The return status is speci fi ed by the n parameter. If you omit the n parameter, the return status is that of the most recent command executed. If you invoke the return command outside of a function or a script, then it is the same as an exit command. |

| set [ + | - abCefhkmnostuvx ] [ + | -o Option ]... [ + | - A Name ] [ Argument ...] | If no options or arguments are speci fi ed, the set command writes the names and values of all shell variables in the collation sequence of the current locale. When options are speci fi ed, they will set or unset attributes of the shell, described as follows: -A Array assignment. Unsets the Name parameter and assigns values sequentially from the speci fi ed Argument parameter list. If the +A flag is used, the Name parameter is not unset fi rst. -a Automatically exports all subsequent parameters that are de fi ned. -b Noti fi es the user asynchronously of background job completions. -C Equivalent to set -o noclobber . -e Executes the ERR trap, if set, and exits if a command has a nonzero exit status unless the simple command is: + contained in an && or || list + the command immediately following if, while or until + contained in the pipeline following ! This mode is disabled while reading pro fi les. -f Disables fi le name substitution. -h Designates each command as a tracked alias when fi rst encountered. -k Places all parameter-assignment arguments in the environment for a command, not only those arguments that precede the command name. -m Runs background jobs in a separate process and prints a line upon completion. The exit status of background jobs is reported in a completion message. On systems with job control, this flag is turned on automatically for interactive shells. For more information, see 'Job control in the Korn shell or POSIX shell' on page 243. -n Reads commands and checks them for syntax errors, but does not execute them. This flag is ignored for interactive shells. |

|        | -o Option Prints current option settings and an error message if you do not specify an argument. You can set more than one option on a single ksh command line. If the +o flag is used, the speci fi ed option is unset. When arguments are speci fi ed, they will cause positional parameters to be set or unset. Arguments, as speci fi ed by the Option variable, can be one of the following: allexport Same as the -a flag. bgnice Runs all background jobs at a lower priority. This is the default mode. emacs Enters an emacs-style inline editor for command entry. errexit Same as the -e flag. gmacs Enters a gmacs-style inline editor for command entry. ignoreeof Does not exit the shell when it encounters an end-of- fi le character. To exit the shell, you must use the exit command or press the Ctrl-D key sequence more than 11 times. keyword Same as the -k flag. Note: This flag is for backward compatibility with the Bourne shell only.

|        | trackall Same as the -h flag. verbose Same as the -v flag. vi Enters the insert mode of a vi - style inline editor for command entry. Entering escape character 033 puts the editor into the move mode. A return sends the line. viraw Processes each character as it is typed in vi mode. xtrace Same as the -x flag. -p Disables processing of the $HOME/.profile fi le and uses the /etc/ suid_profile fi le instead of the ENV fi le. This mode is enabled whenever the effective user ID (UID) or group ID (GID) is not equal to the real UID or GID. Turning off this option sets the effective UID or GID to the real UID and GID. Note: The system does not support the -p option because the operating system does not support setuid shell scripts. -s Sorts the positional parameters lexicographically. -t Exits after reading and executing one command. Note: This flag is for backward compatibility with the Bourne shell only. Its use is strongly discouraged. -u Treats unset parameters as errors when substituting. -v Prints shell input lines as they are read. -x Prints commands and their arguments as they are executed. - Turns off the -x and -v flags and stops examining arguments for flags. - Prevents any flags from being changed. This option is useful in setting the $1 parameter to a value beginning with - . If no arguments follow this flag, the positional parameters are not set. Preceding any of the set command flags with a + rather than a - turns off the flag. You can use these flags when you invoke the shell. When ' set +o ' is invoked without any arguments, it displays the current option settings in a format that is suitable for re-input to the shell as commands that achieve the same option setting. The current set of flags is found in the $- parameter. Unless you specify the -A flag, the remaining arguments are positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to $1 , $2 , ... , and so on. If no arguments are given, the names and values of all named parameters are printed to standard output. |

| trap [ Command ] [ Signal ] ... | Runs the speci fi ed command when the shell receives the speci fi ed signal or signals. The Command parameter is read once when the trap is set and once when the trap is taken. The Signal parameter can be given as a number or as the name of the signal. Trap commands are executed in order of signal number. Any attempt to set a trap on a signal that was ignored on entry to the current shell is ineffective.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| trap [ Command ] [ Signal ] ... | If the value of the Signal parameter is the ERR signal, the speci fi ed command is carried out whenever a command has a nonzero exit status. If the signal is DEBUG , then the speci fi ed command is carried out after each command. If the value of the Signal parameter is the 0 or EXIT signal and the trap command is executed inside the body of a function, the speci fi ed command is carried out after the function completes. If the Signal parameter is 0 or EXIT for a trap command set outside any function, the speci fi ed command is carried out on exit from the shell. |

| typeset [ +HLRZ fi lrtux [ n ]] [ Name [ = Value ]] ... | Sets attributes and values for shell parameters. When invoked inside a function, a new instance of the Name parameter is created. The parameter value and type are restored when the function completes. You can specify the following flags with the typeset command: -H Provides AIX -to-host- fi le mapping on non-AIX machines. -L Left-justi fi es and removes leading blanks from the Value parameter. If the n parameter has a nonzero value, it de fi nes the width of the fi eld; otherwise, it is determined by the width of the value of its fi rst assignment. When the parameter is assigned, it is fi lled on the right with blanks or truncated, if necessary, to fi t into the fi eld. Leading zeros are removed if the -Z flag is also set. The -R flag is turned off. -R Right-justi fi es and fi lls with leading blanks. If the n parameter has a nonzero value, it de fi nes the width of the fi eld; otherwise, it is determined by the width of the value of its fi rst assignment. The fi eld remains fi lled with blanks or is truncated from the end if the parameter is reassigned. The L flag is turned off. -Z Right-justi fi es and fi lls with leading zeros if the fi rst nonblank character is a digit and the -L flag has not been set. If the n parameter has a nonzero value, it de fi nes the width of the fi eld; otherwise, it is determined by the width of the value of its fi rst assignment. -f Indicates that the names refer to function names rather than parameter names. No assignments can be made and the only other valid flags are -t , -u , and -x . The -t flag turns on execution tracing for this function. The -u flag causes this function to be marked unde fi ned. The FPATH variable is searched to fi nd the function de fi nition when the function is referenced. The -x flag allows the function de fi nition to remain in effect across shell scripts that are not a separate invocation of the ksh command. -i Identi fi es the parameter as an integer, making arithmetic faster. If the n parameter has a nonzero value, it de fi nes the output arithmetic base; otherwise, the fi rst assignment determines the output base. -l Converts all uppercase characters to lowercase. The -u uppercase conversion flag is turned off. -r Marks the names speci fi ed by the Name parameter as read-only. These names cannot be changed by subsequent assignment. |

|                        | -t Tags the named parameters. Tags can be de fi ned by the user and have no special meaning to the shell. -u Converts all lowercase characters to uppercase characters. The -l lowercase flag is turned off. -x Marks the name speci fi ed by the Name parameter for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands. Using a + rather than a - turns off the typeset command flags. If you do not specify Name parameters but do specify flags, a list of names (and optionally the values) of the parameters that have these flags set is printed. (Using a + rather than a - keeps the values from being printed.) If you do not specify any names or flags, the names and attributes of all parameters are printed. |
| unset [ -fv ] Name ... | Unsets the values and attributes of the parameters given by the list of names. If -v is speci fi ed, Name refers to a variable name, and the shell will unset it and remove it from the environment. Read-only variables cannot be unset. Unsetting the ERRNO , LINENO , MAILCHECK , OPTARG , OPTIND , RANDOM , SECONDS , TMOUT , and underscore ( _ ) variables removes their special meanings even if they are subsequently assigned. If the -f flag is set, then Name refers to a function name, and the shell will unset the function de fi nition.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| cd Old New                                 | This command can be in either of two forms. In the fi rst form, it changes the current directory to the one speci fi ed by the Argument parameter. If the value of the Argument parameter is a hyphen ( - ), the directory is changed to the previous directory. The HOME shell variable is the default value of the Argument parameter. The PWD variable is set to the current directory. The CDPATH shell variable de fi nes the search path for the directory containing the value of the Argument parameter. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon ( : ). The default path is null, specifying the current directory. The current directory is speci fi ed by a null path name, which appears immediately after the equal sign or between the colon delimiters anywhere in the path list. If the speci fi ed argument begins with a slash ( / ), the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for the argument. The second form of the cd command substitutes the string speci fi ed by the New variable for the string speci fi ed by the Old variable in the current directory name, PWD , and tries to change to this new directory. |

For more information, see the jobs command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| kill [ -s { SignalName | SignalNumber } ] ProcessID... kill [ - SignalName | -SignalNumber ] | Sends a signal (by default, the SIGTERM signal) to a running process. This default action normally stops processes. If you want to stop a process, specify the process ID (PID) in the ProcessID variable. The shell reports the PID of each process that is running in the background (unless you start more than one process in a pipeline, in which case the shell reports the number of the last process). You can also use the ps command to fi nd the process ID number of commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Job control in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, provides a facility to control command sequences, or jobs .

When you execute the set -m special command, the Korn shell associates a job with each pipeline. It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the jobs command, and assigns them small integer numbers.

When a job is started in the background with an ampersand ( &amp; ), the shell prints a line that looks like the following:

[1] 1234

This output indicates that the job, which was started in the background, was job number 1. It also shows that the job had one (top-level) process with a process ID of 1234 .

If you are running a job and want to do something else, use the Ctrl-Z key sequence. This key sequence sends a STOP signal to the current job. The shell normally indicates that the job has been stopped and then displays a shell prompt. You can then manipulate the state of this job (putting it in the background with the bg command), run other commands, and then eventually return the job to the foreground with the fg command. The Ctrl-Z key sequence takes effect immediately, and is like an interrupt in that the shell discards pending output and unread input when you type the sequence.

A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from the terminal. Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output. You can disable this option by issuing the stty tostop command. If you set this terminal option, then background jobs stop when they try to produce output or read input.

You can refer to jobs in the Korn shell in several ways. A job is referenced by the process ID of any of its processes or in one of the following ways:

Item

Description

% Number

Speci fi es the job with the given number.

% String

Speci fi es any job whose command line begins with the String variable.

%? String

Speci fi es any job whose command line contains the String variable.

%%

Speci fi es the current job.

%+

Equivalent to %% .

%- Speci fi es the previous job.

This shell immediately recognizes changes in the process state. It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible. The shell does this just before it prints a prompt so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.

When the monitor mode is on, each completed background job triggers traps set for the CHLD signal.

If you try to leave the shell (either by typing exit or using the Ctrl-D key sequence) while jobs are stopped or running, the system warns you with the message There are stopped (running) jobs. Use the jobs command to see which jobs are affected. If you immediately try to exit again, the shell terminates the stopped and running jobs without warning.

## Signal handling

The SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals for an invoked command are ignored if the command is followed by an ampersand ( &amp; ) and the job monitor option is not active. Otherwise, signals have the values that the shell inherits from its parent.

When a signal for which a trap has been set is received while the shell is waiting for the completion of a foreground command, the trap associated with that signal will not be executed until after the foreground command has completed. Therefore, a trap on a CHILD signal is not performed until the foreground job terminates.

## Inline editing in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

Normally, you type each command line from a terminal device and follow it by a newline character ( RETURN or LINE FEED ). When you activate the emacs, gmacs, or vi inline editing option, you can edit the command line.

The following commands enter edit modes:

## Item

## Description

set -o emacs

Enters emacs editing mode and initiates an emacs-style inline editor.

set -o gmacs

Enters emacs editing mode and initiates a gmacs-style inline editor.

set -o vi

Enters vi editing mode and initiates a vi-style inline editor.

An editing option is automatically selected each time the VISUAL or EDITOR variable is assigned a value that ends in any of these option names.

Note: To use the editing features, your terminal must accept RETURN as a carriage return without line feed. A space must overwrite the current character on the screen.

Each editing mode opens a window at the current line. The window width is the value of the COLUMNS variable if it is de fi ned; otherwise, the width is 80 character spaces. If the line is longer than the window width minus two, the system noti fi es you by displaying a mark at the end of the window. As

the cursor moves and reaches the window boundaries, the window is centered about the cursor. The marks displayed are as follows:

## Item Description

- &gt; Indicates that the line extends on the right side of the window.
- &lt; Indicates that the line extends on the left side of the window.
* Indicates that the line extends on both sides of the window.

The search commands in each edit mode provide access to the Korn shell history fi le. Only strings are matched. If the leading character in the string is a carat ( ^ ), the match must begin at the fi rst character in the line.

## Related concepts

## Korn shell or POSIX shell commands

The Korn shell is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language. It conforms to the Portable Operating System Interface for Computer Environments (POSIX), an international standard for operating systems.

## emacs editing mode

The emacs editing mode is entered when you enable either the emacs or gmacs option. The only difference between these two modes is the way each handles the Ctrl-T edit command.

To edit, move the cursor to the point needing correction and insert or delete characters or words, as needed. All of the editing commands are control characters or escape sequences.

Edit commands operate from any place on a line (not only at the beginning). Do not press the Enter key or line-feed (Down Arrow) key after edit commands, except as noted.

| Ctrl-R String | Reverses search history for a previous command line containing the string speci fi ed by the String parameter. If a value of 0 is given, the search is forward. The speci fi ed string is terminated by an Enter or newline character. If the string is preceded by a carat ( ^ ), the matched line must begin with the String parameter. If the String parameter is omitted, then the next command line containing the most recent String parameter is accessed. In this case, a value of 0 reverses the direction of the search. |
| Ctrl-O        | (Operate) Executes the current line and fetches the next line relative to the current line from the history fi le.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Esc-[ Letter | (Soft-key) Searches the alias list for an alias named double underscore Letter ( __Letter ). If an alias of this name is de fi ned, its value is placed into the input queue. This command can be used to program function keys on many terminals.                                                                                 |
| Esc-.        | Inserts on the line the last word of the previous command. If preceded by a numeric parameter, the value of this parameter determines which word to insert rather than the last word.                                                                                                                                              |
| Esc-_        | Same as the Esc- . key sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Esc-*        | Attempts fi le name substitution on the current word. An asterisk ( * ) is appended if the word does not match any fi le or contain any special pattern characters.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Esc-Esc      | File name completion. Replaces the current word with the longest common pre fi x of all fi le names that match the current word with an asterisk appended. If the match is unique, a slash ( / ) is appended if the fi le is a directory and a space is appended if the fi le is not a directory.                                  |
| Esc-=        | Lists the fi les that match the current word pattern as if an asterisk ( * ) were appended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Ctrl-U       | Multiplies the parameter of the next command by 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| \            | Escapes the next character. Editing characters and the ERASE , KILL and INTERRUPT (normally the Delete key) characters can be entered in a command line or in a search string if preceded by a backslash ( \ ). The backslash removes the next character's editing features, if any.                                               |
| Ctrl-V       | Displays the version of the shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Esc-#        | Inserts a pound sign ( # ) at the beginning of the line and then executes the line. This causes a comment to be inserted in the history fi le.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## vi editing mode

The vi editing mode has two typing modes.

## The modes are:

- Input mode. When you enter a command, the vi editor is in input mode.
- Control mode. Press the Esc key to enter control mode.

Most control commands accept an optional repeat Count parameter prior to the command. When in vi mode on most systems, canonical processing is initially enabled. The command is echoed again if one or more of the following are true:

- The speed is 1200 baud or greater.
- The command contains any control characters.
- Less than one second has elapsed since the prompt was printed.

The Esc character terminates canonical processing for the remainder of the command, and you can then modify the command line. This scheme has the advantages of canonical processing with the type-ahead echoing of raw mode. If the viraw option is also set, canonical processing is always disabled. This mode

is implicit for systems that do not support two alternate end-of-line delimiters and might be helpful for certain terminals.

Available vi edit commands are grouped into categories. The categories are as follows:

## Input edit commands

The input edit commands for the Korn shell are described below.

Note: By default, the editor is in input mode.

| Item   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Korn shell or POSIX shell commands

The Korn shell is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language. It conforms to the Portable Operating System Interface for Computer Environments (POSIX), an international standard for operating systems.

POSIX is not an operating system, but is a standard aimed at portability of applications, at the source level, across many systems. POSIX features are built on top of the Korn shell. The Korn shell (also known as the POSIX shell) offers many of the same features as the Bourne and C shells, such as I/O redirection capabilities, variable substitution, and fi le name substitution. It also includes several additional command and programming language features:

Note: There is a restricted version of Korn shell available, called rksh . For more details, refer to the rksh command.

| Arithmetic evaluation | The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, can perform integer arithmetic using the built-in let command, using any base from 2 to 36. In order to enable recognition of numbers starting with 0 (Octal) and 0x (Hexadecimal) in the Korn shell, run the following commands: |
| Command history       | The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, stores a fi le that records all of the commands you enter. You can use a text editor to alter a command in this history fi le and then reissue the command.                                                                       |
| Coprocess facility    | Enables you to run programs in the background and send and receive information to these background processes.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Editing               | The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, offers inline editing options that enable you to edit the command line. Editors similar to emacs, gmacs, and vi are available.                                                                                                    |

A Korn shell command is one of the following:

- Simple command
- Pipeline

- List
- Compound command
- Function

When you issue a command in the Korn shell or POSIX shell, the shell evaluates the command and does the following:

- Makes all indicated substitutions.
- Determines whether the command contains a slash ( / ). If it does, the shell runs the program named by the speci fi ed path name.

If the command does not contain a slash ( / ), the Korn shell or POSIX shell continues with the following actions:

- Determines whether the command is a special built-in command. If it is, the shell runs the command within the current shell process.
- Compares the command to user-de fi ned functions. If the command matches a user-de fi ned function, then the positional parameters are saved and then reset to the arguments of the function call. When the function completes or issues a return, the positional parameter list is restored, and any trap set on EXIT within the function is carried out. The value of a function is the value of the last command executed. A function is carried out in the current shell process.
- If the command name matches the name of a regular built-in command, then that regular built-in command will be invoked.
- Creates a process and attempts to carry out the command by using the exec command (if the command is neither a built-in command nor a user-de fi ned function).

The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, searches each directory in a speci fi ed path for an executable fi le. The PATH shell variable de fi nes the search path for the directory containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated with a colon ( : ). The default path is /usr/bin: (specifying the /usr/bin directory, and the current directory, in that order). The current directory is speci fi ed by two or more adjacent colons, or by a colon at the beginning or end of the path list.

If the fi le has execute permission but is not a directory or an a.out fi le, the shell assumes that it contains shell commands. The current shell process creates a subshell to read the fi le. All nonexported aliases, functions, and named parameters are removed from the fi le. If the shell command fi le has read permission, or if the setuid or setgid bits are set on the fi le, then the shell runs an agent that sets up the permissions and carries out the shell with the shell command fi le passed down as an open fi le. A parenthesized command is run in a subshell without removing nonexported quantities.

## Coprocess facility

The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, allows you to run one or more commands as background processes. These commands, run from within a shell script, are called coprocesses .

## Inline editing in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

Normally, you type each command line from a terminal device and follow it by a newline character ( RETURN or LINE FEED ). When you activate the emacs, gmacs, or vi inline editing option, you can edit the command line.

## Arithmetic evaluation in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn shell or POSIX shell regular built-in let command enables you to perform integer arithmetic.

Korn shell or POSIX shell built-in commands

Special commands are built in to the Korn shell and POSIX shell and executed in the shell process.

## Korn shell compound commands

A compound command can be a list of simple commands or a pipeline, or it can begin with a reserved word. Most of the time, you will use compound commands such as if , while , and for when you are writing shell scripts.

The following is a list of list of Korn shell or POSIX shell compound commands:

## Parameters in the Korn shell

Korn shell parameters are discussed below.

## Shell startup

You can start the Korn shell with the ksh command, psh command (POSIX shell), or the exec command.

If the shell is started by the exec command, and the fi rst character of zero argument ( $0 ) is the hyphen ( -), then the shell is assumed to be a login shell. The shell fi rst reads commands from the /etc/profile fi le and then from either the .profile fi le in the current directory or from the $HOME/.profile fi le, if either fi le exists. Next, the shell reads commands from the fi le named by performing parameter substitution on the value of the ENV environment variable, if the fi le exists.

If you specify the File [ Parameter ] parameter when invoking the Korn shell or POSIX shell, the shell runs the script fi le identi fi ed by the File parameter, including any parameters speci fi ed. The script fi le speci fi ed must have read permission; any setuid and setgid settings are ignored. The shell then reads the commands.

Note: Do not specify a script fi le with the -c or -s flags when invoking the Korn shell or POSIX shell.

For more information on positional parameters, see 'Parameters in the Korn shell' on page 224.

## Related concepts

Parameters in the Korn shell

Korn shell parameters are discussed below.

## Korn shell environment

All variables (with their associated values) known to a command at the beginning of its execution constitute its environment .

This environment includes variables that a command inherits from its parent process and variables speci fi ed as keyword parameters on the command line that calls the command. The shell interacts with the environment in several ways. When it is started, the shell scans the environment and creates a parameter for each name found, giving the parameter the corresponding value and marking it for export. Executed commands inherit the environment.

If you modify the values of the shell parameters or create new ones using the export or typeset -x commands, the parameters become part of the environment. The environment seen by any executed command is therefore composed of any name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, whose values might be modi fi ed by the current shell, plus any additions that resulted from using the export or typeset -x commands. The executed command (subshell) will see any modi fi cations it makes to the

environment variables it has inherited, but for its child shells or processes to see the modi fi ed values, the subshell must export these variables.

The environment for any simple command or function is changed by pre fi xing with one or more parameter assignments. A parameter assignment argument is a word of the form Identi fi er = Value . Thus, the two following expressions are equivalent (as far as the execution of the command is concerned):

```
TERM=450 Command arguments (export TERM; TERM=450; Command arguments)
```

## Korn shell functions

The function reserved word de fi nes shell functions. The shell reads and stores functions internally. Alias names are resolved when the function is read. The shell executes functions in the same manner as commands, with the arguments passed as positional parameters.

The Korn shell or POSIX shell executes functions in the environment from which functions are invoked. All of the following are shared by the function and the invoking script, and side effects can be produced:

- Variable values and attributes (unless you use typeset command within the function to declare a local variable)
- Working directory
- Aliases, function de fi nitions, and attributes
- Special parameter $
- Open fi les

The following are not shared between the function and the invoking script, and there are no side effects:

- Positional parameters
- Special parameter #
- Variables in a variable assignment list when the function is invoked
- Variables declared using typeset command within the function
- Options
- Traps. However, signals ignored by the invoking script will also be ignored by the function.

Note: In earlier versions of the Korn shell, traps other than EXIT and ERR were shared by the function as well as the invoking script.

If trap on 0 or EXIT is executed inside the body of a function, then the action is executed after the function completes, in the environment that called the function. If the trap is executed outside the body of a function, then the action is executed upon exit from the Korn shell. In earlier versions of the Korn shell, no trap on 0 or EXIT outside the body of a function was executed upon exit from the function.

When a function is executed, it has the same syntax-error and variable-assignment properties described in Korn shell or POSIX shell built-in commands.

The compound command is executed whenever the function name is speci fi ed as the name of a simple command. The operands to the command temporarily will become the positional parameters during the execution of the compound command. The special parameter # will also change to reflect the number of operands. The special parameter 0 will not change.

The return special command is used to return from function calls. Errors within functions return control to the caller.

Function identi fi ers are listed with the -f or +f option of the typeset special command. The -f option also lists the text of functions. Functions are unde fi ned with the -f option of the unset special command.

Ordinarily, functions are unset when the shell executes a shell script. The -xf option of the typeset special command allows a function to be exported to scripts that are executed without a separate invocation of

the shell. Functions that must be de fi ned across separate invocations of the shell should be speci fi ed in the ENV fi le with the -xf option of the typeset special command.

The exit status of a function de fi nition is zero if the function was not successfully declared. Otherwise, it will be greater than zero. The exit status of a function invocation is the exit status of the most recent command executed by the function.

## Related concepts

## Parameters in the Korn shell

Korn shell parameters are discussed below.

## Korn shell or POSIX shell built-in commands

Special commands are built in to the Korn shell and POSIX shell and executed in the shell process.

## Korn shell or POSIX shell command history

The Korn shell or POSIX shell saves commands entered from your terminal device to a history fi le.

If set, the HISTFILE variable value is the name of the history fi le. If the HISTFILE variable is not set or cannot be written, the history fi le used is $HOME/.sh\_history . If the history fi le does not exist and the Korn shell cannot create it, or if it does exist and the Korn shell does not have permission to append to it, then the Korn shell uses a temporary fi le as the history fi le. The shell accesses the commands of all interactive shells using the same named history fi le with appropriate permissions.

By default, the Korn shell or POSIX shell saves the text of the last 128 commands for nonroot users and 512 commands for the root user. The history fi le size (speci fi ed by the HISTSIZE variable) is not limited, although a very large history fi le can cause the Korn shell to start slowly.

## Command history substitution

Use the fc built-in command to list or edit portions of the history fi le. To select a portion of the fi le to edit or list, specify the number or the fi rst character or characters of the command.

You can specify a single command or range of commands.

If you do not specify an editor program as an argument to the fc regular built-in command, the editor speci fi ed by the FCEDIT variable is used. If the FCEDIT variable is not de fi ned, then the /usr/bin/ed fi le is used. The edited command or commands are printed and run when you exit the editor.

The editor name hyphen ( -) is used to skip the editing phase and run the command again. In this case, a substitution parameter of the form Old=New can be used to modify the command before it is run. For example, if r is aliased to fc -e -, then typing r bad=good c runs the most recent command that starts with the letter c and replaces the fi rst occurrence of the bad string with the good string.

## Command aliasing in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, allows you to create aliases to customize commands.

The alias command de fi nes a word of the form Name=String as an alias. When you use an alias as the fi rst word of a command line, the Korn shell checks to see if it is already processing an alias with the same name. If it is, the Korn shell does not replace the alias name. If an alias with the same name is not already being processed, the Korn shell replaces the alias name by the value of the alias.

The fi rst character of an alias name can be any printable character except the metacharacters. The remaining characters must be the same as for a valid identi fi er. The replacement string can contain any valid shell text, including the metacharacters.

If the last character of the alias value is a blank, the shell also checks the word following the alias for alias substitution. You can use aliases to rede fi ne special built-in commands but not to rede fi ne reserved words. Alias de fi nitions are not inherited across invocations of ksh . However, if you specify alias -x , the alias stays in effect for scripts invoked by name that do not invoke a separate shell. To export an alias de fi nition and to cause child processes to have access to them, you must specify alias -x and the alias de fi nition in your environment fi le.

Use the alias command to create, list, and export aliases.

Use the unalias command to remove aliases.

The format for creating an alias is as follows:

```
alias Name=String
```

where the Name parameter speci fi es the name of the alias, and the String parameter speci fi es the value of the alias.

The following exported aliases are prede fi ned by the Korn shell but can be unset or rede fi ned. It is not recommended that you change them, because this might later confuse anyone who expects the alias to work as prede fi ned by the Korn shell.

```
autoload='typeset -fu' -f'
```

```
false='let 0' functions='typeset hash='alias -t' history='fc -l' integer='typeset -i' nohup='nohup ' r='fc -e -' true=':' type='whence -v'
```

Aliases are not supported on noninteractive invocations of the Korn shell ( ksh ); for example, in a shell script, or with the -c option in ksh , as in the following:

```
ksh -c alias
```

## Creating a command alias (alias shell command)

An alias lets you create a shortcut name for a command, fi le name, or any shell text. By using aliases, you save a lot of time when doing tasks you do frequently. You can create a command alias.

## Tracked aliases

Frequently, aliases are used as shorthand for full path names. One aliasing facility option allows you to automatically set the value of an alias to the full path name of a corresponding command. This special type of alias is a tracked alias.

Tracked aliases speed execution by eliminating the need for the shell to search the PATH variable for a full path name.

The set -h command turns on command tracking so that each time a command is referenced, the shell de fi nes the value of a tracked alias. This value is unde fi ned each time you reset the PATH variable.

These aliases remain tracked so that the next subsequent reference will rede fi ne the value. Several tracked aliases are compiled into the shell.

## Tilde substitution

After the shell performs alias substitution, it checks each word to see if it begins with an unquoted tilde ( ~ ). If it does, the shell checks the word, up to the fi rst slash ( / ), to see if it matches a user name in the /etc/passwd fi le. If the shell fi nds a match, it replaces the ~ character and the name with the login directory of the matched user. This process is called tilde substitution .

The shell does not change the original text if it does not fi nd a match. The Korn shell also makes special replacements if the ~ character is the only character in the word or followed by plus sign ( + ) or hyphen ( -):

| Item   | Description                                                                     |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~      | Replaced by the value of the HOME variable                                      |
| ~+     | Replaced by the $PWD variable (the full path name of the current directory)     |
| ~-     | Replaced by the $OLDPWD variable (the full path name of the previous directory) |

In addition, the shell attempts tilde substitution when the value of a variable assignment parameter begins with a tilde ~ character.

## Bourne shell

The Bourne shell is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language.

The bsh command runs the Bourne shell.

The Bourne shell can be run either as a login shell or as a subshell under the login shell. Only the login command can call the Bourne shell as a login shell. It does this by using a special form of the bsh command name: -bsh . When called with an initial hyphen ( -), the shell fi rst reads and runs commands found in the system /etc/profile fi le and your $HOME/.profile , if one exists. The /etc/profile fi le sets variables needed by all users. Finally, the shell is ready to read commands from your standard input.

If the File [ Parameter ] parameter is speci fi ed when the Bourne shell is started, the shell runs the script fi le identi fi ed by the File parameter, including any parameters speci fi ed. The script fi le speci fi ed must have read permission; any setuid and setgid settings are ignored. The shell then reads the commands. If either the -c or -s flag is used, do not specify a script.

The following are the shells that are provided with AIX.

## Bourne shell environment

All variables (with their associated values) known to a command at the beginning of its execution constitute its environment . This environment includes variables that a command inherits from its parent process and variables speci fi ed as keyword parameters on the command line that calls the command.

The shell passes to its child processes the variables named as arguments to the built-in export command. This command places the named variables in the environments of both the shell and all its future child processes.

Keyword parameters are variable-value pairs that appear in the form of assignments, normally before the procedure name on a command line (but see also the flag for the set command). These variables are placed in the environment of the procedure being called.

See the following examples:

- Consider the following procedure, which displays the values of two variables (saved in a command fi le named key\_command ):

```
# key_command echo $a $b
```

The following command lines produce the output shown:

Input Output a=key1 b=key2 key\_command key1 key2 a=tom b=john key\_command tom john

A procedure's keyword parameters are not included in the parameter count stored in $# .

A procedure can access the values of any variables in its environment. If it changes any of these values, however, the changes are not reflected in the shell environment. The changes are local to the procedure in question. To place the changes in the environment that the procedure passes to its child processes, you must export the new values within that procedure.

See the following examples:

- To obtain a list of variables that are exportable from the current shell, type the following:

```
export
```

- To obtain a list of read-only variables from the current shell, type the following:

readonly

- To obtain a list of variable-value pairs in the current environment, type the following:

env

For more information about user environments, see '/etc/environment fi le' on page 320.

## Conditional substitution in the Bourne shell

Normally, the shell replaces the expression $ Variable with the string value assigned to the Variable variable, if there is one. However, there is a special notation that allows conditional substitution , depending on whether the variable is set or not null, or both.

By de fi nition, a variable is set if it has ever been assigned a value. The value of a variable can be the null string, which you can assign to a variable in any one of the following ways:

| Item   |    | Description                                                                                                     |
|--------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A=     |    |                                                                                                                 |
| bcd="" |    |                                                                                                                 |
| Efg='' |    | Assigns the null string to the A , bcd , and Efg .                                                              |
| set '' | "" | Sets the fi rst and second positional parameters to the null string and unsets all other positional parameters. |

The following is a list of the available expressions you can use to perform conditional substitution:

| Item                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In conditional substitution, the shell does not evaluate the String variable until the shell uses this variable as a substituted string. Thus, in the following example, the shell executes the pwd command only if d is not set or is null:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

User-de fi ned variables in the Bourne shell

The Bourne shell recognizes alphanumeric variables to which string values can be assigned.

## Positional parameters in the Bourne shell

When you run a shell procedure, the shell implicitly creates positional parameters that reference each word on the command line by its position on the command line.

The word in position 0 (the procedure name) is called $0 , the next word (the fi rst parameter) is called $1 , and so on, up to $9 . To refer to command line parameters numbered higher than 9, use the built-in shift command.

You can reset the values of the positional parameters explicitly by using the built-in set command.

Note: When an argument for a position is not speci fi ed, its positional parameter is set to null. Positional parameters are global and can be passed to nested shell procedures.

## File name substitution in the Bourne shell

The Bourne shell permits you to perform fi le name substitutions.

Command parameters are often fi le names. You can automatically produce a list of fi le names as parameters on a command line. To do this, specify a character that the shell recognizes as a patternmatching character. When a command includes such a character, the shell replaces it with the fi le names in a directory.

Note: The Bourne shell does not support fi le name expansion based on equivalence classi fi cation of characters.

Most characters in such a pattern match themselves, but you can also use some special pattern-matching characters in your pattern. These special characters are as follows:

| Item       | Description                                                                                                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *          | Matches any string, including the null string                                                                  |
| ?          | Matches any one character                                                                                      |
| [ . . . ]  | Matches any one of the characters enclosed in square brackets                                                  |
| [! . . . ] | Matches any character within square brackets other than one of the characters that follow the exclamation mark |

Within square brackets, a pair of characters separated by a hyphen ( -) speci fi es the set of all characters lexicographically within the inclusive range of that pair, according to the binary ordering of character values.

Pattern matching has some restrictions. If the fi rst character of a fi le name is a dot ( . ), it can be matched only by a pattern that also begins with a dot. For example, * matches the fi le names my fi le and your fi le but not the fi le names .my fi le and .your fi le . To match these fi les, use a pattern such as the following:

.*file

If a pattern does not match any fi le names, then the pattern itself is returned as the result of the attempted match.

File and directory names should not contain the characters * , ? , [ , or ] because they can cause in fi nite recursion (that is, in fi nite loops) during pattern-matching attempts.

## Input and output redirection in the Bourne shell

There are redirection options that can be used in commands.

In general, most commands do not know whether their input or output is associated with the keyboard, the display screen, or a fi le. Thus, a command can be used conveniently either at the keyboard or in a pipeline.

The following redirection options can appear anywhere in a simple command. They can also precede or follow a command, but are not passed to the command.

Bourne shell built-in commands

Special commands are built into the Bourne shell and run in the shell process.

## Bourne shell commands

You can issue commands in the Bourne shell.

When you issue a command in the Bourne shell, it fi rst evaluates the command and makes all indicated substitutions. It then runs the command provided that:

- The command name is a Bourne shell special built-in command.

OR

- The command name matches the name of a de fi ned function. If this is the case, the shell sets the positional parameters to the parameters of the function.

If the command name matches neither a built-in command nor the name of a de fi ned function and the command names an executable fi le that is a compiled (binary) program, the shell (as parent ) creates a new ( child ) process that immediately runs the program. If the fi le is marked executable but is not a compiled program, the shell assumes that it is a shell procedure. In this case, the shell creates another instance of itself (a subshell ), to read the fi le and execute the commands included in it. The shell also runs a parenthesized command in a subshell. To the user, a compiled program is run in exactly the same way as a shell procedure. The shell normally searches for commands in fi le system directories in this order:

1. /usr/bin
2. /etc
3. /usr/sbin
4. /usr/ucb
5. $HOME/bin
6. /usr/bin/X11
7. /sbin
8. Current directory

The shell searches each directory, in turn, continuing with the next directory if it fails to fi nd the command.

Note: The PATH variable determines the order in which the shell searches directories. You can change the particular sequence of directories searched by resetting the PATH variable.

If you give a speci fi c path name when you run a command (for example, /usr/bin/sort ), the shell does not search any directories other than the one you specify. If the command name contains a slash ( / ), the shell does not use the search path.

You can give a full path name that begins with the root directory (such as /usr/bin/sort ). You can also specify a path name relative to the current directory. If you specify, for example:

## bin/myfile

the shell looks in the current directory for a directory named bin and in that directory for the fi le myfile .

Note: The restricted shell does not run commands containing a slash ( / ).

The shell remembers the location in the search path of each executed command (to avoid unnecessary exec commands later). If it fi nds the command in a relative directory (one whose name does not begin with / ), the shell must redetermine the command's location whenever the current directory changes. The shell forgets all remembered locations each time you change the PATH variable or run the hash -r command.

## Character quotation

Many characters have a special meaning to the shell. Sometimes you want to conceal that meaning. Single ( ' ) and double ( " ) quotation marks surrounding a string, or a backslash ( \ ) before a single character allow you to conceal the character's meaning.

All characters (except the enclosing single quotation marks) are taken literally, with any special meaning removed. Thus, the command:

```
stuff='echo $? $*; ls * | wc'
```

assigns the literal string echo $? $*; ls * | wc to the variable stuff . The shell does not execute the echo , ls , and wc commands or expand the $? and $* variables and the asterisk ( * ) special character.

Within double quotation marks, the special meaning of the dollar sign ( $ ), backquote ( ` ), and double quotation ( " ) characters remains in effect, while all other characters are taken literally. Thus, within double quotation marks, command and variable substitution takes place. In addition, the quotation marks do not affect the commands within a command substitution that is part of the quoted string, so characters there retain their special meanings.

Consider the following sequence:

```
ls * file1 file2 file3 message="This directory contains `ls * ` " echo $message This directory contains file1 file2 file3
```

This shows that the asterisk ( * ) special character inside the command substitution was expanded.

To hide the special meaning of the dollar sign ( $ ), backquote ( ` ), and double quotation ( " ) characters within double quotation marks, precede these characters with a backslash ( \ ). When you do not use double quotation marks, preceding a character with a backslash is equivalent to placing it within single quotation marks. Therefore, a backslash immediately preceding a newline character (that is, a backslash at the end of the line) hides the newline character and allows you to continue the command line on the next physical line.

## Signal handling

The shell ignores INTERRUPT and QUIT signals for an invoked command if the command is terminated with an ampersand ( &amp; ); that is, if it is running in the background. Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by the shell from its parent, with the exception of the SEGMENTATION VIOLATION signal.

For more information, see the Bourne shell built-in trap command.

## Bourne shell compound commands

A compound command is one of the following.

- Pipeline (one or more simple commands separated by the pipe ( | ) symbol)
- List of simple commands
- Command beginning with a reserved word
- Command beginning with the control operator left parenthesis ( ( )

Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a compound command is that of the last simple command executed.

## Reserved words

The following reserved words for the Bourne shell are recognized only when they appear without quotation marks as the fi rst word of a command.

| for                | do                   | done   |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------|
| case if elif while | esac then else until | fi     |

## Bourne shell built-in commands

Special commands are built into the Bourne shell and run in the shell process.

Unless otherwise indicated, output is written to fi le descriptor 1 (standard output) and the exit status is 0 (zero) if the command does not contain any syntax errors. Input and output redirection is permitted.

The following special commands are treated somewhat differently from other special built-in commands:

The Bourne shell processes these commands as follows:

- Keyword parameter assignment lists preceding the command remain in effect when the command completes.
- I/O redirections are processed after parameter assignments.
- Errors in a shell script cause the script to stop processing.

| cd Directory ]          | Changes the current directory to Directory . If you do not specify Directory , the value of the HOME shell variable is used. The CDPATH shell variable de fi nes the search path for Directory . CDPATH is a colon-separated list of alternative directory names. A null path name speci fi es the current directory (which is the default path). This null path name appears immediately after the equal sign in the assignment or between the colon delimiters anywhere else in the path list. If Directory begins with a slash ( / ), the shell does not use the search path. Otherwise, the shell searches each directory in the CDPATH shell variable. Note: The restricted shell cannot run the cd shell command. |

| hash [ -r ] [ Command . . . ] | Finds and remembers the location in the search path of each Command speci fi ed. The -r flag causes the shell to forget all locations. If you do not specify the flag or any commands, the shell displays information about the remembered commands in the following format: Hits Cost Command Hits indicates the number of times a command has been run by the shell process. Cost is a measure of the work required to locate a command in the search path. Command shows the path names of each speci fi ed command. Certain situations require that the stored location of a command be recalculated; for example, the location of a relative path name when the current directory changes. Commands for which that might be done are indicated by an asterisk ( * ) next to the Hits |
| pwd                           | Displays the current directory.

If the assignment precedes a command name, the export attribute is effective only for that command execution environment, except when the assignment precedes one of the special built-in commands. In this case, the export attribute persists after the built-in command has completed. If the assignment does not precede a command name, or if the assignment is a result of the operation of the getopts or read commands, the export attribute persists until the variable is unset. |

| shift [ n ]                      | Shifts command line arguments to the left; that is, reassigns the value of the positional parameters by discarding the current value of $1 and assigning the value of $2 to $1 , of $3 to $2 , and so on. If there are more than 9 command line arguments, the 10 th is assigned to $9 and any that remain are still unassigned (until after another shift ). If there are 9 or fewer arguments, the shift command unsets the highest-numbered positional parameter that has a value. The $0 positional parameter is never shifted. The shift n command is a shorthand notation specifying n number of consecutive shifts. The default value of the n parameter is 1.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| trap [ Command ] [ n ] . . .     | Runs the command speci fi ed by the Command parameter when the shell receives the signal or signals speci fi ed by the n parameter. The trap commands are run in order of signal number. Any attempt to set a trap on a signal that was ignored on entry to the current shell is ineffective. Note: The shell scans the Command parameter once when the trap is set and again when the trap is taken. If you do not specify a command, then all traps speci fi ed by the n parameter are reset to their current values. If you specify a null string, this signal is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes. If the n parameter is zero (0), the speci fi ed command is run when you exit from the shell. If you do not specify either a command or a signal, the trap command displays a list of commands associated with each signal number. |

| ulimit [ -HS ] [ - c | -d | -f | -m | -r | -s | -t | -u ] [ limit ] | Displays or adjusts allocated shell resources. The shell resource settings can be displayed either individually or as a group. The default mode is to display resources set to the soft setting, or the lower bound, as a group. The setting of shell resources depends on the effective user ID of the current shell. The hard level of a resource can be set only if the effective user ID of the current shell is root. You will get an error if you are not root user and you are attempting to set the hard level of a resource. By default, the root user sets both the hard and soft limits of a particular resource. The root user should therefore be careful in using the -S , -H , or default flag usage of limit settings. Unless you are a root user, you can set only the soft limit of a resource. After a limit has been decreased by a nonroot user, it cannot be increased, even back to the original system limit. To set a resource limit, select the appropriate flag and the limit value of the new resource, which should be an integer. You can set only one resource limit at a time. If more than one resource flag is speci fi ed, you receive unde fi ned results. By default, ulimit with only a new value on the command line sets the fi le size of the shell. Use of the -f flag is optional. You can specify the following ulimit command flags: -c Sets or displays core segment for shell. -d Sets or displays data segment for shell. -f Sets or displays fi le size for shell. -H Sets or displays hard resource limit (root user only). -m Sets or displays memory for shell. -r Sets or displays maximum number of threads per process. -s Sets or displays stack segment for shell. -S Sets or displays soft resource limit. -t Sets or displays CPU time maximum for shell. -u |

This value, along with the permissions of the creating process, determines a fi le's permissions when the fi le is created. The default is 022.

Command substitution in the Bourne shell

Command substitution allows you to capture the output of any command as an argument to another command.

When you place a command line within backquotes ( `` ), the shell fi rst runs the command or commands and then replaces the entire expression, including the backquotes, with the output. This feature is often used to give values to shell variables. For example, the statement:

```
today=`date`
```

assigns the string representing the current date to the today variable. The following assignment saves, in the fi les variable, the number of fi les in the current directory:

```
files=`ls | wc -l`
```

You can perform command substitution on any command that writes to standard output.

To nest command substitutions, precede each of the nested backquotes with a backslash ( \ ), as in:

```
logmsg=`echo Your login directory is \`pwd\``
```

You can also give values to shell variables indirectly by using the read special command. This command takes a line from standard input (usually your keyboard) and assigns consecutive words on that line to any variables named. For example:

```
read first init last takes an input line of the form: J. Q. Public and has the same effect as if you had typed: first=J. init=Q. last=Public
```

The read special command assigns any excess words to the last variable.

Variable substitution in the Bourne shell

The Bourne shell permits you to perform variable substitutions.

The Bourne shell has several mechanisms for creating variables (assigning a string value to a name). Certain variables, positional parameters and keyword parameters are normally set only on a command line. Other variables are simply names to which you or the shell can assign string values.

## Unattended terminals

All systems are vulnerable if terminals are left logged in and unattended. The most serious problem occurs when a system manager leaves a terminal unattended that has been enabled with root authority. In general, users should log out anytime they leave their terminals.

## User-de fi ned variables in the Bourne shell

The Bourne shell recognizes alphanumeric variables to which string values can be assigned.

To assign a string value to a name, type the following:

```
Name=String
```

A name is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores that begins with an underscore or a letter. To use the value that you have assigned to a variable, add a dollar sign ( $ ) to the beginning of its name. Thus, the $Name variable yields the value speci fi ed by the String variable. Note that no spaces are on either side of the equal sign ( = ) in an assignment statement. (Positional parameters cannot appear in an assignment statement. You can put more than one assignment on a command line, but remember that the shell performs the assignments from right to left.

If you enclose the String variable with double or single quotation marks ( " or ' ), the shell does not treat blanks, tabs, semicolons, and newline characters within the string as word delimiters, but it imbeds them literally in the string.

If you enclose the String variable with double quotation marks ( " ), the shell still recognizes variable names in the string and performs variable substitution; that is, it replaces references to positional parameters and other variable names that are prefaced by dollar sign ( $ ) with their corresponding values, if any. The shell also performs command substitution within strings that are enclosed in double quotation marks.

If you enclose the String variable with single quotation marks ( ' ), the shell does not substitute variables or commands within the string. The following sequence illustrates this difference:

You:

num=875

number1="Add $num"

number2='Add $num'

echo $number1

System:

Add 875

You:

echo $number2

System:

Add $num

The shell does not reinterpret blanks in assignments after variable substitution. Thus, the following assignments result in $first and $second having the same value:

first='a string with embedded blanks' second=$first

When you reference a variable, you can enclose the variable name (or the digit designating a positional parameter) in braces { } to delimit the variable name from any string following. In particular, if the character immediately following the name is a letter, digit, or underscore, and the variable is not a positional parameter, then the braces are required:

| You:    | a='This is a' echo "${a}n example"   |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| System: | This is an example                   |
| You:    | echo "$a test"                       |
| System: | This is a test                       |

## Positional parameters in the Bourne shell

When you run a shell procedure, the shell implicitly creates positional parameters that reference each word on the command line by its position on the command line.

## Conditional substitution in the Bourne shell

Normally, the shell replaces the expression $ Variable with the string value assigned to the Variable variable, if there is one. However, there is a special notation that allows conditional substitution , depending on whether the variable is set or not null, or both.

## Variables used by the Bourne shell

The shell uses the following variables. Although the shell sets some of them, you can set or reset all of them.

| HOME   | Indicates the name of your login directory , which is the directory that becomes the current directory upon completion of a login. The login program initializes this variable. The cd command uses the value of the $HOME variable as its default value. Using this variable rather than an explicit path name in a shell procedure allows the procedure to be run from a different directory without alterations. |

| MAIL        | Indicates the path name of the fi le used by the mail system to detect the arrival of new mail. If this variable is set, the shell periodically checks the modi fi cation time of this fi le and displays the value of $MAILMSG if the time changes and the length of the fi le is greater than 0. Set the MAIL variable in the .profile fi le. The value normally assigned to it by users of the mail command is /usr/spool/mail/$LOGNAME .                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| MAILCHECK   | The number of seconds that the shell lets elapse before checking again for the arrival of mail in the fi les speci fi ed by the MAILPATH or MAIL variables. The default value is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If you set the MAILCHECK variable to 0, the shell checks before each prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| MAILMSG     | The mail noti fi cation message. If you explicitly set the MAILMSG variable to a null string ( MAILMSG="" ), no message is displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MAILPATH    | A list of fi le names separated by colons. If this variable is set, the shell informs you of the arrival of mail in any of the fi les speci fi ed in the list. You can follow each fi le name by a % and a message to be displayed when mail arrives. Otherwise, the shell uses the value of the MAILMSG variable or, by default, the message [YOU HAVE NEW MAIL] . Note: When the MAILPATH variable is set, these fi les are checked instead of the fi le set by the MAIL variable. To check the fi les set by the MAILPATH variable and the fi le set by the MAIL variable, specify the MAIL fi le in your list of MAILPATH fi les. |

## Positional parameters in the Bourne shell

When you run a shell procedure, the shell implicitly creates positional parameters that reference each word on the command line by its position on the command line.

## Blank interpretation

After the shell performs variable and command substitution, it scans the results for internal fi eld separators (those de fi ned in the IFS shell variable).

The shell splits the line into distinct words at each place it fi nds one or more of these characters separating each distinct word with a single space. It then retains explicit null arguments ( "" or '' ) and discards implicit null arguments (those resulting from parameters that have no values).

## Variables used by the Bourne shell

The shell uses the following variables. Although the shell sets some of them, you can set or reset all of them.

## C shell

The C shell is an interactive command interpreter and a command programming language. It uses syntax that is similar to the C programming language.

## The csh command starts the C shell.

When you log in, the csh command fi rst searches the system-wide setup fi le /etc/csh.cshrc . If the setup fi le exists, the C shell executes the commands stored in that fi le. Next, the C shell executes the system-wide setup fi le /etc/csh.login if it is available. Then, it searches your home directory for

the .cshrc and .login fi les. If they exist, they contain any customized user information pertinent to running the C shell. All variables set in the /etc/csh.cshrc and /etc/csh.login fi les might be overridden by your .cshrc and .login fi les in your $HOME directory. Only the root user can modify the /etc/csh.cshrc and /etc/csh.login fi les.

The /etc/csh.login and $HOME/.login fi les are executed only once at login time. These fi les are generally used to hold environment variable de fi nitions, commands that you want executed once at login, or commands that set up terminal characteristics.

The /etc/csh.cshrc and $HOME/.cshrc fi les are executed at login time and every time the csh command or a C shell script is invoked. They are generally used to de fi ne C shell characteristics, such as aliases and C shell variables (for example, history , noclobber , or ignoreeof ). It is recommended that you only use the C shell built-in commands in the /etc/csh.cshrc and $HOME/.cshrc fi les because using other commands increases the startup time for shell scripts.

C shell built-in commands list

The following are C shell built-in commands.

## C shell limitations

The following are limitations of the C shell.

- Words can be no longer than 1024 bytes.
- Argument lists are limited to ARG\_MAX bytes. Values for the ARG\_MAX variable are found in the /usr/ include/sys/limits.h fi le.
- The number of arguments to a command that involves fi le name expansion is limited to 1/6 th the number of bytes allowed in an argument list.
- Command substitutions can substitute no more bytes than are allowed in an argument list.
- To detect looping, the shell restricts the number of alias substitutions on a single line to 20.
- The csh command does not support fi le name expansion based on equivalence classi fi cation of characters.
- File descriptors (other than standard in, standard out, and standard error) opened before csh executes any application are not available to that application.

## Alias substitution in the C shell

An alias is a name assigned to a command or command string. The C shell allows you to assign aliases and use them as you would commands. The shell maintains a list of the aliases that you de fi ne.

After the shell scans the command line, it divides the commands into distinct words and checks the fi rst word of each command, left to right, to see if there is an alias. If an alias is found, the shell uses the history mechanism to replace the text of the alias with the text of the command referenced by the alias. The resulting words replace the command and argument list. If no reference is made to the history list, the argument list is left unchanged.

The alias and unalias built-in commands establish, display, and modify the alias list. Use the alias command in the following format:

```
alias [ Name [ WordList ]]
```

The optional Name variable speci fi es the alias for the speci fi ed name. If you specify a word list with the WordList variable, the command assigns it as the alias of the Name variable. If you run the alias command without either optional variable, it displays all C shell aliases.

If the alias for the ls command is ls -l , the following command:

```
ls /usr
```

is replaced by the command:

```
ls -l /usr
```

The argument list is undisturbed because there is no reference to the history list in the command with an alias. Similarly, if the alias for the lookup command is as follows:

```
grep \!^ /etc/passwd then the shell replaces lookup bill with the following: grep bill /etc/passwd
```

In this example, !^ refers to the history list, and the shell replaces it with the fi rst argument in the input line, in this case bill .

You can use special pattern-matching characters in an alias. The following command:

```
alias lprint 'pr &bslash2.!* >
```

```
> print'
```

creates a command that formats its arguments to the line printer. The ! character is protected from the shell in the alias by use of single quotation marks so that the alias is not expanded until the pr command runs.

If the shell locates an alias, it performs the word transformation of the input text and begins the alias process again on the reformed input line. If the fi rst word of the next text is the same as the previous text, then looping is prevented by flagging the alias to terminate the alias process. Other subsequent loops are detected and result in an error.

## Related concepts

## History substitution in the C shell

History substitution lets you modify individual words from previous commands to create new commands. History substitution makes it easy to repeat commands, repeat the arguments of a previous command in the current command, or fi x spelling mistakes in the previous command with little typing.

## Variable substitution in the C shell

The C shell maintains a set of variables, each of which has as its value a list of zero or more words. Some of these variables are set by the shell or referred to by it. For example, the argv variable is an image of the shell variable list, and words that comprise the value of this variable are referred to in special ways.

To change and display the values of variables, use the set and unset commands. Of the variables referred to by the shell, a number are toggles (variables that turn something on and off). The shell does not examine toggles for a value, only for whether they are set or unset. For example, the verbose shell variable is a toggle that causes command input to be echoed. The setting of this variable results from issuing the -v flag on the command line.

Other operations treat variables numerically. The @ command performs numeric calculations, and the result is assigned to a variable. Variable values are, however, always represented as (zero or more) strings. For numeric operations, the null string is considered to be zero, and the second and subsequent words of multi-word values are ignored.

When you issue a command, the shell parses the input line and performs alias substitution. Next, before running the command, it performs variable substitution. The $ character keys the substitution. It is, however, passed unchanged if followed by a blank, tab, or newline character. Preceding the $ character with a \ prevents this expansion, except in two cases:

- The command is enclosed in " " . In this case, the shell always performs the substitution.
- The command is enclosed in ' ' . In this case, the shell never performs the substitution. Strings enclosed in ' ' are interpreted for command substitution.

The shell recognizes input and output redirection before variable expansion and expands each separately. Otherwise, the command name and complete argument list expand together. It is therefore possible for the fi rst (command) word to generate more than one word, the fi rst of which becomes the command name, and the rest of which become parameters.

Unless enclosed in " " or given the :q modi fi er, the results of variable substitution might eventually be subject to command and fi le name substitution. When enclosed by double quotation marks, a variable with a value that consists of multiple words expands to a single word or a portion of a single word, with the words of the variable's value separated by blanks. When you apply the :q modi fi er to a substitution, the variable expands to multiple words. Each word is separated by a blank and enclosed in double quotation marks to prevent later command or fi le name substitution.

The following notations allow you to introduce variable values into the shell input. Except as noted, it is an error to reference a variable that is not set with the set command.

You can apply the modi fi ers :gh , :gt , :gr , :h , :r , :q , and :x to the following substitutions. If { } appear in the command form, then the modi fi ers must be placed within the braces. Only one : modi fi er is permitted on each variable expansion.

| ${ Name [ number ]} | Selects only some of the words from the value of the Name variable. The number is subjected to variable substitution and might consist of a single number or two numbers separated by a hyphen ( - ). The fi rst word of a variable's string value is numbered 1. If the fi rst number of a range is omitted, it defaults to 1. If the last number of a range is omitted, it defaults to $# Name . The asterisk ( * ) symbol selects all words. It is not an error for a range to be empty if the second argument is omitted or is in a range.     |

## Related concepts

## Command substitution in the C shell

In command substitution , the shell executes a speci fi ed command and replaces that command with its output.

## File name substitution in the C shell

The C Shell permits you to do fi le name substitutions.

The C shell provides several shortcuts to save time and keystrokes. If a word contains any of the characters * , ? , [ ] , or { } , or begins with a tilde ( ~ ), that word is a candidate for fi le name substitution. The C shell regards the word as a pattern and replaces the word with an alphabetized list of fi le names matching the pattern.

The current collating sequence is used, as speci fi ed by the LC\_COLLATE or LANG environment variables. In a list of words specifying fi le name substitution, an error results if no patterns match an existing fi le name. However, it is not required that every pattern match. Only the character-matching symbols * , ? , and [ ] indicate pattern-matching or fi le name expansion. The tilde ( ~ ) and { } characters indicate fi le name abbreviation.

## File name expansion in the C shell

The asterisk ( * ) character matches any string of characters, including the null string.

For example, in a directory containing the fi les:

```
a aa aax alice b bb c cc
```

the command echo a* prints all fi les names beginning with the character a :

```
a aa aax alice
```

Note: When fi le names are matched, the characters dot ( . ) and slash ( / ) must be matched explicitly.

The question mark ( ? ) character matches any single character. The following command:

ls a?x lists every fi le name beginning with the letter a , followed by a single character, and ending with the letter x :

```
aax
```

To match a single character or a range of characters, enclose the character or characters inside of [ ] . The following command:

```
ls [abc]
```

lists all fi le names exactly matching one of the enclosed characters:

```
a b c
```

Within brackets, a lexical range of characters is indicated by [a-z] . The characters matching this pattern are de fi ned by the current collating sequence.

## File name abbreviation in the C shell

The tilde ( ~ ) and { characters indicate fi le name abbreviation. A ~ at the beginning of a fi le name is used to represent home directories. Standing alone, the ~ character expands to your home directory as reflected in the value of the home shell variable.

For example, the following command:

ls ~

lists all fi les and directories located in your $HOME directory.

When the command is followed by a name consisting of letters, digits, and hyphen ( -) characters, the shell searches for a user with that name and substitutes that user's $HOME directory.

Note: If the ~ character is followed by a character other than a letter or slash ( / ), or appears anywhere except at the beginning of a word, it does not expand.

To match characters in fi le names without typing the entire fi le name, use { } around the fi le names. The pattern a{b,c,d}e is another way of writing abe ace ade . The shell preserves the left-to-right order and separately stores the results of matches at a low level to preserve this order. This construct might be nested. Thus, the following:

```
~source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c expands to: /usr/source/s1/oldls.c /usr/source/s1/ls.c if the home directory for source is /usr/source . Similarly, the following: ../{memo,*box} might expand to: ../memo ../box ../mbox
```

Note: memo is not sorted with the results of matching *box . As a special case, the { , } , and { } characters are passed undisturbed.

## Character classes in the C shell

You can use character classes to match fi le names within a range indication.

The following format instructs the system to match any single character belonging to the speci fi ed class:

```
[: charclass :]
```

The following classes correspond to ctype subroutines:

| Character Class   | De fi nition                                                                          |

| punct             | Punctuation character                                                                 |
| space             | Space, horizontal tab, carriage return, newline, vertical tab, or form-feed character |
| upper             | Uppercase characters                                                                  |
| xdigit            | Hexadecimal digits                                                                    |

Suppose that you are in a directory containing the following fi les:

```
a aa aax Alice b bb c cc
```

Type the following command at a C shell prompt:

| ls [:lower:]                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The C shell lists all fi le names that begin with lowercase characters: |
| a aa aax b bb c cc                                                      |

## Environment variables in the C shell

Certain variables have special meaning to the C shell. Of these, argv , cwd , home , path , prompt , shell , and status are always set by the shell.

Except for the cwd and status variables, the action of being set by the shell occurs only at initialization. All of the above variables maintain their settings unless you explicitly reset them.

The csh command copies the USER , TERM , HOME , and PATH environment variables into the csh variables, user , term , home , and path , respectively. The values are copied back into the environment whenever the normal shell variables are reset. The path variable cannot be set in other than in the .cshrc fi le because csh subprocesses import the path de fi nition from the environment and reexport it if changed.

The following variables have special meanings:

| Item      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

For commands that are not built-in, all expansions occur before echoing. Built-in commands are echoed before command and fi le name substitution because these substitutions are then done selectively.                                                |
| histchars | Speci fi es a string value to change the characters used in history substitution. Use the fi rst character of its value as the history substitution character, this replaces the default character, ! . The second character of its value replaces the ^ character in quick substitutions. Note: Setting the histchars value to a character used in command or fi le names might |
| history   | Contains a numeric value to control the size of the history list. Any command that is referenced within the number of events permitted is not discarded. Very large values of the history variable might cause the shell to run out of memory. Regardless of whether this variable is set, the C shell always saves the last command that ran on the history list.               |
| home      | Indicates your home directory initialized from the environment. The fi le name expansion of the tilde ( ~ ) character refers to this variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ignoreeof | Speci fi es that the shell ignore an end-of- fi le character from input devices that are workstations. This prevents shells from accidentally being killed when the shell reads an end-of- fi le character (Ctrl-D).                                                                                                                                                             |
| mail      | Speci fi es the fi les where the shell checks for mail. This is done after each command completion which results in a prompt if a speci fi ed time interval has elapsed. The shell displays the message Mail in file if the fi le exists with an access time less than its change time.                                                                                          |

| Item      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| noclobber | If the fi rst word of the value of the mail variable is numeric, it speci fi es a different mail-checking time interval (in seconds); the default is 600 (10 minutes). If you specify multiple mail fi les, the shell displays the message New mail in file , when there is mail in the speci fi ed fi le. Places restrictions on output redirection to ensure that fi les are not accidentally destroyed and that redirections append to existing fi les. |
| noglob    | Inhibits fi le name expansion. This is most useful in shell scripts that do not deal with fi le names or when a list of fi le names has been obtained and further expansions are not desirable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| nonomatch | Speci fi es that no error results if a fi le name expansion does not match any existing fi les; rather, the primitive pattern returns. It is still an error for the primitive pattern to be malformed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| notify    | Speci fi es that the shell send asynchronous noti fi cation of changes in job status. The default presents status changes just before displaying the shell prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| path      | Speci fi es directories in which commands are sought for execution. A null word speci fi es the current directory. If there is no path variable set, then only full path names can run. The default search path (from the /etc/environment fi le used during login) is as follows:                                                                                                                                                                         |
| prompt    | Speci fi es the string displayed before each command is read from an interactive workstation input. If a ! appears in the string, it is replaced by the current event number. If the ! character is in a quoted string enclosed by single or double quotation marks, the ! character must be preceded by a \ . The default prompt for users without root authority is % . The default prompt for the user with root authority is # .                       |
| savehist  | Speci fi es a numeric value to control the number of entries of the history list that are saved in the ~/.history fi le when you log out. Any command referenced in this number of events is saved. During startup, the shell reads ~/.history into the history list, enabling history to be saved across logins. Very large values of the savehist variable slow down the shell startup.                                                                  |
| shell     | Speci fi es the fi le in which the C shell resides. This is used in forking shells to interpret fi les that have execute bits set, but which are not executable by the system. This is initialized to the home of the C shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| status    | Speci fi es the status returned by the last command. If the command ends abnormally, 0200 is added to the status. Built-in commands that are unsuccessful return an exit status of 1. Successful built-in commands set status to a value of 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| time      | Controls automatic timing of commands. If this variable is set, any command that takes more than the speci fi ed number of CPU seconds will display a line of resources used at the end of execution. For more information about the default outputs, see the built-in time command.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| verbose   | Set by the -v command line flag, this variable causes the words of each command to display after history substitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Job control in the C shell

The shell associates a job number with each process. The shell keeps a table of current jobs and assigns them small integer numbers.

When you start a job in the background with an ampersand ( &amp; ) , the shell prints a line that looks like the following:

[1] 1234

This line indicates that the job number is 1 and that the job is composed of a single process with a process ID of 1234 . Use the built-in jobs command to see the table of current jobs.

A job running in the background competes for input if it tries to read from the workstation. Background jobs can also produce output for the workstation that gets interleaved with the output of other jobs.

You can refer to jobs in the shell in several ways. Use the percent ( % ) character to introduce a job name. This name can be either the job number or the command name that started the job, if this name is unique. For example, if a make process is running as job 1, you can refer to it as %1 . You can also refer to it as %make if there is only one suspended job with a name that begins with the string make . You can also use the following:

%?String to specify a job whose name contains the String variable, if there is only one such job.

The shell detects immediately whenever a process changes its state. If a job becomes blocked so that further progress is impossible, the shell sends a message to the workstation. This message displays only after you press the Enter key. If, however, the notify shell variable is set, the shell immediately issues a message that indicates changes in the status of background jobs. Use the built-in notify command to mark a single process so that its status changes are promptly reported. By default, the notify command marks the current process.

|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| endsw    | Marks the end of a switch ( String ) case String : ... breaksw default: ... breaksw endsw command sequence. This command sequence successively matches each case label against the value of the String variable. Execution continues after the endsw command if a breaksw command is executed or if no label matches and there is no default. |
| eval     | Reads variable values as input to the shell and executes the resulting command or commands in the context of the current shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| exec     | Runs the speci fi ed command in place of the current shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| exit     | Exits the shell with either the value of the status shell variable or the value of the speci fi ed expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## C shell

The C shell is an interactive command interpreter and a command programming language. It uses syntax that is similar to the C programming language.

C shell built-in commands

Built-in commands are run within the shell. If a built-in command occurs as any component of a pipeline, except the last, the command runs in a subshell.

## Signal handling in the C shell

The C shell normally ignores quit signals. Jobs running detached are not affected by signals generated from the keyboard ( INTERRUPT , QUIT , and HANGUP ).

Other signals have the values the shell inherits from its parent. You can control the shell's handling of INTERRUPT and TERMINATE signals in shell procedures with onintr . Login shells catch or ignore TERMINATE signals depending on how they are set up. Shells other than login shells pass TERMINATE signals on to the child processes. In no cases are INTERRUPT signals allowed when a login shell is reading the .logout fi le.

## C shell commands

A simple command is a sequence of words separated by blanks or tabs. A word is a sequence of characters or numerals, or both, that does not contain blanks without quotation marks.

In addition, the following characters and doubled characters also form single words when used as command separators or terminators:

<!-- image -->

These special characters can be parts of other words. Preceding them with a backslash ( \ ), however, prevents the shell from interpreting them as special characters. Strings enclosed in ' ' or " " (matched pairs of quotation characters) or backquotes can also form parts of words. Blanks, tab characters, and special characters do not form separate words when they are enclosed in these marks. In addition, you can enclose a newline character within these marks by preceding it with a backslash ( \ ).

The fi rst word in the simple command sequence (numbered 0) usually speci fi es the name of a command. Any remaining words, with a few exceptions, are passed to that command. If the command speci fi es an executable fi le that is a compiled program, the shell immediately runs that program. If the fi le is marked executable but is not a compiled program, the shell assumes that it is a shell script. In this case, the shell starts another instance of itself (a subshell) to read the fi le and execute the commands included in it.

## C shell built-in commands

Built-in commands are run within the shell. If a built-in command occurs as any component of a pipeline, except the last, the command runs in a subshell.

Note: If you enter a command from the C shell prompt, the system searches for a built-in command fi rst. If a built-in command does not exist, the system searches the directories speci fi ed by the path shell variable for a system-level command. Some C shell built-in commands and operating system commands have the same name. However, these commands do not necessarily work the same way. For more information on how the command works, check the appropriate command description.

If you run a shell script from the shell, and the fi rst line of the shell script begins with #!/ ShellPathname , the C shell runs the shell speci fi ed in the comment to process the script. Otherwise, it runs the default shell (the shell linked to /usr/bin/sh ). If run by the default shell, C shell builtin commands might not be recognized. To run C shell commands, make the fi rst line of the script #!/usr/bin/csh .

| chdir [ Name ]             | Changes the current directory to that speci fi ed by the Name variable. If you do not specify Name , the command changes to your home directory. If the value of the Name variable is not a subdirectory of the current directory and does not begin with / , ./ , or ../ , the shell checks each component of the cdpath shell variable to see if it has a subdirectory matching the Name variable. If the Name variable is a shell variable with a value that begins with a slash ( / ), the shell tries this to see if it is a directory. The chdir command is equivalent to the cd command. |

| end                                 | Successively sets the Name variable to each member speci fi ed by the List variable and runs the sequence of Commands between the foreach and the matching end statements. The foreach and end statements must appear alone on separate lines. Uses the continue statement to continue the loop and the break statement to end the loop prematurely. When the foreach command is read from the terminal, the C shell prompts with a ? to allow Commands to be entered. Commands within loops, prompted for by ? , are not placed in the history list.                                                                                                                                                               |
| endif                               | If the Expression variable is true, runs the Commands that follow the fi rst then statement. If the else if Expression2 is true, runs the Commands that follow the second then statement. If the else if Expression2 is false, runs the Commands that follow the else . Any number of else if pairs are possible. Only one endif statement is needed. The else segment is optional. The words else and endif can be used only at the beginning of input lines. The if segment must appear alone on its input line or after an else command.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| endsw                               | Successively matches each case label against the value of the string variable. The string is command and fi le name expanded fi rst. Use the pattern-matching characters * , ? , and [ . . . ] in the case labels, which are variable-expanded. If none of the labels match before a default label is found, the execution begins after the default label. The case label and the default label must appear at the beginning of the line. The breaksw command causes execution to continue after the endsw command. Otherwise, control might fall through the case and default labels, as in the C programming language. If no label matches and there is no default , execution continues after the endsw command. |

| hashstat                                  | Displays statistics indicating how successful the hash table has been at locating commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| history [ -r | -h ] [ n ]                 | Displays the history event list. The oldest events are displayed fi rst. If you specify a number n , only the speci fi ed number of the most recent events are displayed. The -r flag reverses the order in which the events are displayed so the most recent is displayed fi rst. The -h flag displays the history list without leading numbers. Use this flag to produce fi les suitable for use with the -h flag of the source command.               |
| if ( Expression ) Command                 | Runs the speci fi ed Command (including its arguments) if the speci fi ed Expression is true. Variable substitution on the Command variable happens early, at the same time as the rest of the if statement. The speci fi ed Command must be a simple command (rather than a pipeline, command list, or parenthesized command list). Note: Input and output redirection occurs even if the Expression variable is false and the Command is not executed. |
| jobs [ -l ]                               | Lists the active jobs. With the -l (lowercase L ) flag, the jobs command lists process IDs in addition to the job number and name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| kill -l | [[- Signal ]% Job ...| PID ...] | Sends either the TERM (terminate) signal or the signal speci fi ed by Signal to the speci fi ed Job or PID (process). Specify signals either by number or by name (as given in the /usr/include/sys/signal.h fi le, stripped of the SIG pre fi x). The -l (lowercase L ) flag lists the signal names.                                                                                                                                                    |

| limit [ -h ] [ Resource [ Max-Use ]] | Limits the usage of the speci fi ed resource by the current process and each process it creates. Process resource limits are de fi ned in the /etc/security/limits fi le. Controllable resources are the central processing unit (CPU) time, fi le size, data size, core dump size, and memory use. Maximum allowable values for these resources are set with the mkuser command when the user is added to the system. They are changed with the chuser command. Limits are categorized as either soft or hard. Users may increase their soft limits up to the ceiling imposed by the hard limits. You must have root user authority to increase a soft limit above the hard limit, or to change hard limits. The -h flag displays hard limits instead of the soft limits. If a Max-Use parameter is not speci fi ed, the limit command displays the current limit of the speci fi ed resource. If the Resource parameter is not speci fi ed, the limit command displays the current limits of all resources. For more information about the resources controlled by the limit subcommand, see the getrlimit , setrlimit , or vlimit subroutine. The Max-Use parameter for CPU time is speci fi ed in the hh : mm : ss format. The Max-Use parameter for other resources is speci fi ed as a floating-point number or an integer optionally followed by a scale factor. The scale factor is k or kilobytes (1024 bytes), mor megabytes, or b or blocks (the units used by the ulimit subroutine. If you do not specify a scale factor, k is assumed for all resources. For both resource names and scale factors, unambiguous pre fi xes of the names suf fi ce. Note: This command limits the physical memory (memory use) available for a process only if there is contention for system memory by other active processes. |
| login                                | Ends a login shell and replaces it with an instance of the /usr/bin/ login command. This is one way to log out (included for compatibility with the ksh and bsh commands).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| nice [ + n ] [ Command ]             | If no values are speci fi ed, sets the priority of commands run in this shell to 24. If the + n flag is speci fi ed, sets the priority plus the speci fi ed number. If the + n flag and Command are speci fi ed, runs Command at priority 24 plus the speci fi ed number. If you have root user authority, you can run the nice statement with a negative number. The Command always runs in a subshell, and the restrictions placed on commands in simple if statements apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| nohup [ Command ]                    | Causes hangups to be ignored for the remainder of the script when no Command is speci fi ed. If Command is speci fi ed, causes the speci fi ed Command to be run with hangups ignored. To run a pipeline or list of commands, put the pipeline or list in a shell script, give the script execute permission, and use the shell script as the value of the Command variable. All processes run in the background with an ampersand ( & ) are effectively protected from being sent a hangup signal when you log out. However, these processes are still subject to explicitly sent hangups unless the nohup statement is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| notify [ % Job ...]                                 | Causes the shell to notify you asynchronously when the status of the current job or speci fi ed Job changes. Normally, the shell provides noti fi cation just before it presents the shell prompt. This feature is automatic if the notify shell variable is set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| onintr [ - | Label ]                                | Controls the action of the shell on interrupts. If no arguments are speci fi ed, restores the default action of the shell on interrupts, which ends shell scripts or returns to the command input level. If a - flag is speci fi ed, causes all interrupts to be ignored. If Label is speci fi ed, causes the shell to run a goto Label statement when the shell receives an interrupt or when a child process ends due to an interruption. In any case, if the shell is running detached and interrupts are being ignored, all forms of the onintr statement have no meaning. Interrupts continue to be ignored by the shell and all invoked commands.                                                                                                                              |
| popd [ + n ]                                        | Pops the directory stack and changes to the new top directory. If you specify a + n variable, the command discards the n th entry in the stack. The elements of the directory stack are numbered from the top, starting at 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| pushd [ + n | Name ]                                | With no arguments, exchanges the top two elements of the directory stack. With the Name variable, the command changes to the new directory and pushes the old current directory (as given in the cwd shell variable) onto the directory stack. If you specify a + n variable, the command rotates the n th component of the directory stack around to be the top element and changes to it. The members of the directory stack are numbered from the top, starting at 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| rehash                                              | Causes recomputation of the internal hash table of the contents of the directories in the path shell variable. This action is needed if new commands are added to directories in the path shell variable while you are logged in. The rehash command is necessary only if commands are added to one of the user's own directories or if someone changes the contents of one of the system directories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| repeat Count Command                                | Runs the speci fi ed Command , subject to the same restrictions as commands in simple if statements, the number of times speci fi ed by Count . Note: I/O redirections occur exactly once, even if the Count variable equals 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| set [[ Name [ n ]] [ = Word ]] | [ Name = ( List )] | Shows the value of all shell variables when used with no arguments. Variables that have more than a single word as their value are displayed as a parenthesized word list. If only Name is speci fi ed, the C shell sets the Name variable to the null string. Otherwise, sets Name to the value of the Word variable, or sets the Name variable to the list of words speci fi ed by the List variable. When n is speci fi ed, the n th component of the Name variable is set to the value of the Word variable; the n th component must already exist. In all cases, the value is command and fi le name expanded. These arguments may be repeated to set multiple values in a single set command. However, variable expansion happens for all arguments before any setting occurs. |

| setenv Name Value  | Sets the value of the environment variable speci fi ed by the Name variable to Value , a single string. The most commonly used environment variables, USER , TERM , HOME , and PATH , are automatically imported to and exported from the C shell variables user , term , home , and path . There is no need to use the setenv statement for these.                                                             |
| shift [ Variable ] | Shifts the members of the argv shell variable or the speci fi ed Variable to the left. An error occurs if the argv shell variable or speci fi ed Variable is not set or has less than one word as its value.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| source [ -h ] Name | Reads commands written in the Name fi le. You can nest the source commands. However, if they are nested too deeply, the shell might run out of fi le descriptors. An error in a source command at any level ends all nested source commands. Normally, input during source commands is not placed on the history list.

| switch ( string )  | Starts a switch ( String ) case String : ... breaksw default: ... breaksw endsw command sequence. This command sequence successively matches each case label against the value of the String variable. If none of the labels match before a default label is found, the execution begins after the default label.                                                                                               |

| time [ Command ]   | The time command controls automatic timing of commands. If you do not specify the Command variable, the time command displays a summary of time used by this shell and its children. If you specify a command with the Command variable, it is timed. The shell then displays a time summary, as described under the time shell variable. If necessary, an extra shell is created to display the time statistic when the command completes. |
|                    | The following example uses time with the sleep command:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| while ( Expression ) Command . . . end | Evaluates the Commands between the while and the matching end statements while the expression speci fi ed by the Expression variable evaluates nonzero. You can use the break statement to end and the continue statement to continue the loop prematurely. The while and end statements must appear alone on their input lines. If the input is from a terminal, prompts occur after the while ( Expression ) similar to the foreach statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| @ [ Name [ n ] = Expression ]          | Displays the values of all the shell variables when used with no arguments. Otherwise, sets the name speci fi ed by the Name variable to the value of the Expression variable. If the expression contains < , > , & , or | characters, this part of the expression must be placed within parentheses. When n is speci fi ed, the n th component of the Name variable is set to the Expression variable. Both the Name variable and its n th component must already exist. C language operators, such as *= and += , are available. The space separating the Name variable from the assignment operator is optional. Spaces are, however, required in separating components of the Expression variable, which would otherwise be read as a single word. Special suf fi x operators, double plus sign ( ++ ) and double hyphen ( -- ) increase and decrease, respectively, the value of the Name variable. |

## C shell expressions and operators

The @ built-in command and the exit , if , and while statements accept expressions that include operators similar to those of C language, with the same precedence.

The following operators are available:

| Operator    | What it means                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| ()          | change precedence                  |
| ~           | complement                         |
| !           | negation                           |
| */ %        | multiply, divide, modulo           |
| + -         | add, subtract                      |
| << > >      | left shift, right shift            |
| <= >= < >   | relational operators               |
| == != =~ !~ | string comparison/pattern matching |
| &           | bitwise AND                        |
| ^           | bitwise exclusive OR               |

## Operator What it means

| |   | bitwise inclusive OR   |
|-----|------------------------|
| &&  | logical AND            |
| ||  | logical OR             |

In the previous list, precedence of the operators decreases down the list (left to right, top to bottom).

Note: The operators + and -are right-associative. For example, evaluation of a + b -c is performed as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and not as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The ==, != , =~ , and !~ operators compare their arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers. The =~ and !~ operators are similar to == and != , except that the rightmost side is a pattern against which the leftmost operand is matched. This reduces the need for use of the switch statement in shell procedures.

The logical operators or ( | |) and and ( &amp;&amp; ) are also available. They can be used to check for a range of numbers, as in the following example:

```
if ($#argv > 2 && $#argv < 7) then
```

In the preceding example, the number of arguments must be greater than 2 and less than 7.

Strings beginning with zero (0) are considered octal numbers. Null or missing arguments are considered 0. All expressions result in strings representing decimal numbers. Note that two components of an expression can appear in the same word. Except when next to components of expressions that are syntactically signi fi cant to the parser ( &amp; | &lt; &gt; ( ) ), expression components should be surrounded by spaces.

Also available in expressions as primitive operands are command executions enclosed in parentheses ( ) and fi le inquiries of the form ( -operator Filename ), where operator is one of the following:

## Ite Description

m

- r Read access
- w Write access
- x Execute access
- e Existence
- o Ownership
- z Zero size
- f Plain fi le
- d Directory

The speci fi ed Filename is command and fi le name expanded and then tested to see if it has the speci fi ed relationship to the real user. If Filename does not exist or is inaccessible, all inquiries return false(0) . If the command runs successfully, the inquiry returns a value of true(1) . Otherwise, if the command fails, the inquiry returns a value of false(0) . If more detailed status information is required, run the command outside an expression and then examine the status shell variable.

## Command substitution in the C shell

In command substitution , the shell executes a speci fi ed command and replaces that command with its output.

To perform command substitution in the C shell, enclose the command or command string in backquotes ( ` ` ). The shell normally breaks the output from the command into separate words at blanks, tabs, and newline characters. It then replaces the original command with this output.

In the following example, the backquotes ( ` ` ) around the date command indicate that the output of the command will be substituted:

```
echo The current date and time is: `date` The output from this command might look like the following: The current date and time is: Wed Apr 8 13:52:14 CDT 1992
```

The C shell performs command substitution selectively on the arguments of built-in shell commands. This means that it does not expand those parts of expressions that are not evaluated. For commands that are not built-in, the shell substitutes the command name separately from the argument list. The substitution occurs in a child of the main shell, but only after the shell performs input or output redirection.

If a command string is surrounded by " " , the shell treats only newline characters as word separators, thus preserving blanks and tabs within the word. In all cases, the single fi nal newline character does not force a new word.

## Related concepts

## Variable substitution in the C shell

The C shell maintains a set of variables, each of which has as its value a list of zero or more words. Some of these variables are set by the shell or referred to by it. For example, the argv variable is an image of the shell variable list, and words that comprise the value of this variable are referred to in special ways.

## Nonbuilt-in C shell command execution

When the C shell determines that a command is not a built-in shell command, it attempts to run the command with the execv subroutine.

Each word in the path shell variable names a directory from which the shell attempts to run the command. If given neither the -c nor -t flag, the shell hashes the names in these directories into an internal table. The shell tries to call the execv subroutine on a directory only if there is a possibility that the command resides there. If you turn off this mechanism with the unhash command or give the shell the -c or -t flag, the shell concatenates with the given command name to form a path name of a fi le. The shell also does this in any case for each directory component of the path variable that does not begin with a slash ( / ). The shell then attempts to run the command.

Parenthesized commands always run in a subshell. For example:

```
(cd ; pwd) ; pwd displays the home directory without changing the current directory location. However, the command: cd ; pwd
```

changes the current directory location to the home directory. Parenthesized commands are most often used to prevent the chdir command from affecting the current shell.

If the fi le has execute permission, but is not an executable binary to the system, then the shell assumes it is a fi le containing shell commands and runs a new shell to read it.

If there is an alias for the shell, then the words of the alias are pre fi xed to the argument list to form the shell command. The fi rst word of the alias should be the full path name of the shell.

## History substitution in the C shell

History substitution lets you modify individual words from previous commands to create new commands. History substitution makes it easy to repeat commands, repeat the arguments of a previous command in the current command, or fi x spelling mistakes in the previous command with little typing.

History substitutions begin with the exclamation mark ( ! ) character and can appear anywhere on the command line, provided they do not nest (in other words, a history substitution cannot contain another history substitution). You can precede the ! with a \ to cancel the exclamation point's special meaning. In addition, if you place the ! before a blank, tab, newline character, = , or ( , history substitution does not occur.

History substitutions also occur when you begin an input line with a carat ( ^ ). The shell echoes any input line containing history substitutions at the workstation before it executes that line.

## Alias substitution in the C shell

An alias is a name assigned to a command or command string. The C shell allows you to assign aliases and use them as you would commands. The shell maintains a list of the aliases that you de fi ne.

## History lists for the C shell

The history list saves commands that the shell reads from the command line that consist of one or more words. History substitution reintroduces sequences of words from these saved commands into the input stream.

The history shell variable controls the size of the history list. You must set the history shell variable either in the .cshrc fi le or on the command line with the built-in set command. The previous command is always retained regardless of the value of the history variable. Commands in the history list are numbered sequentially, beginning with 1. The built-in history command produces output similar to the following:

```
9 write michael 10 ed write.c 11 cat oldwrite.c 12 diff *write.c
```

The shell displays the command strings with their event numbers. The event number appears to the left of the command and represent when the command was entered in relation to the other commands in the history. It is not usually necessary to use event numbers to refer to events, but you can have the current event number displayed as part of your system prompt by placing an exclamation mark ( ! ) in the prompt string assigned to the PROMPT environment variable.

A full history reference contains an event speci fi cation, a word designator, and one or more modi fi ers in the following general format:

```
Event[.]Word:Modifier[:Modifier] . . .
```

Note: Only one word can be modi fi ed. A string that contains blanks is not allowed.

In the previous sample of history command output, the current event number is 13. Using this example, the following refer to previous events:

## Item

Description

!10 Event number 10.

!-2 Event number 11 (the current event minus 2).

!d

Command word beginning with d (event number 12).

!?mic? Command word containing the string mic (event number 9).

These forms, without further modi fi cation, simply reintroduce the words of the speci fi ed events, each separated by a single blank. As a special case, !! refers to the previous command; the command !! alone on an input line reruns the previous command.

## Event speci fi cation for the C shell

To select words from an event, follow the event speci fi cation with a colon ( : ) and one of the following word designators (the words of an input line are numbered sequentially starting from 0)

## Ite Description

m

- 0 First word (the command name)
- n n th argument
- ^ First argument
- $ Last argument
- % Word matched by an immediately preceding ? string ? search
- x-y Range of words from the x th word to the y th word
- -y Range of words from the fi rst word (0) to the y th word
* First through the last argument, or nothing if there is only one word (the command name) in the event
- x * x th argument through the last argument
- x -Same as x * but omitting the last argument

If the word designator begins with a ^ , $ , * , -, or % , you can omit the colon that separates the event speci fi cation from the word designator. You can also place a sequence of the following modi fi ers after the optional word designator, each preceded by a colon:

## Item

## Description

| h                      | Removes a trailing path name extension, leaving the head.                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| r                      | Removes a trailing . xxx component, leaving the root name.                           |
| e                      | Removes all but the . xxx trailing extension.                                        |
| s/ OldWord / NewWord / | Substitutes the value of the NewWord variable for the value of the OldWord variable. |

The left side of a substitution is not a pattern in the sense of a string recognized by an editor; rather, it is a word, a single unit without blanks. Normally, a slash ( / ) delimits the original word ( OldWord ) and its replacement ( NewWord ). However, you can use any character as the delimiter. In the following example, using the % as a delimiter allows a / to be included in the words:

s%/home/myfile%/home/yourfile%

The shell replaces an ampersand ( &amp; ) with the OldWord text in the NewWord variable. In the following example, /home/myfile becomes /temp/home/myfile .

s%/home/myfile%/temp&amp;%

The shell replaces a null word in a substitution with either the last substitution or with the last string used in the contextual scan !? String ? . You can omit the trailing delimiter ( / ) if a newline character follows immediately. Use the following modi fi ers to delimit the history list:

## Item Description

- t Removes all leading path name components, leaving the tail
- &amp; Repeats the previous substitution
- g Applies the change globally; that is, all occurrences for each line
- p Displays the new command, but does not run it

## Item Description

- q Quotes the substituted words, thus preventing further substitutions
- x Acts like the q modi fi er, but breaks into words at blanks, tabs, and newline characters

When using the preceding modi fi ers, the change applies only to the fi rst modi fi able word unless the g modi fi er precedes the selected modi fi er.

If you give a history reference without an event speci fi cation (for example, !$ ), the shell uses the previous command as the event. If a previous history reference occurs on the same line, the shell repeats the previous reference. Thus, the following sequence gives the fi rst and last arguments of the command that matches ?foo? .

```
!?foo?^ !$
```

A special abbreviation of a history reference occurs when the fi rst nonblank character of an input line is a carat ( ^ ). This is equivalent to !:s^ , thus providing a convenient shorthand for substitutions on the text of the previous line. The command ^ lb^ lib corrects the spelling of lib in the command.

If necessary, you can enclose a history substitution in braces { } to insulate it from the characters that follow. For example, if you want to use a reference to the command:

```
ls -ld ~paul
```

to perform the command:

```
ls -ld ~paula
```

use the following construction:

!{l}a

In this example, !{l} a looks for a command starting with l and appends a to the end.

Quotation with single and double quotes

To prevent further interpretation of all or some of the substitutions, enclose strings in single and double quotation marks.

Enclosing strings in ' ' prevents further interpretation, while enclosing strings in " " allows further expansion. In both cases, the text that results becomes all or part of a single word.

## Input and output redirection in the C shell

Before the C shell executes a command, it scans the command line for redirection characters. These special notations direct the shell to redirect input and output.

You can redirect the standard input and output of a command with the following syntax statements:

| << Word | Reads the shell input up to the line that matches the value of the Word variable. The Word variable is not subjected to variable, fi le name, or command substitution. Each input line is compared to the Word variable before any substitutions are done on the line. Unless a quoting character ( \ , " , ' or ` ) appears in the Word variable, the shell performs variable and command substitution on the intervening lines, allowing the \ character to quote the $ , \ , and ` characters. Commands that are substituted have all blanks, tabs, and newline characters preserved, except for the fi nal newline character, which is dropped. The resultant text is placed in an anonymous temporary fi le, which is given to the command as standard input. |

If File does not exist, it is created. If File exists, it is truncated, and its previous contents are lost. If the noclobber shell variable is set, File must not exist or be a character special fi le, or an error results. This helps prevent accidental destruction of fi les. In this case, use the forms including a ! to suppress this check. File is expanded in the same way as < input fi le names. The form >& redirects both standard output and standard error to the speci fi ed File .

A command receives the environment in which the shell was invoked, as changed by the input/output parameters and the presence of the command as a pipeline. Thus, unlike some previous shells, commands that run from a shell script do not have access to the text of the commands by default. Instead, they receive the original standard input of the shell. Use the &lt;&lt; mechanism to present inline data, which allows shell command fi les to function as components of pipelines and also lets the shell block read its input. Note that the default standard input for a command run detached is not changed to the empty /dev/null fi le. Instead, the standard input remains the original standard input of the shell.

To redirect the standard error through a pipe with the standard output, use the form |&amp; rather than only the | .

## Flow control in the C shell

The shell contains commands that can be used to regulate the flow of control in command fi les (shell scripts) and (in limited but useful ways) from shell command-line input. These commands all operate by forcing the shell to repeat, or skip, in its input.

The foreach , switch , and while statements, and the if-then-else form of the if statement, require that the major keywords appear in a single simple command on an input line.

If the shell input is not searchable, the shell buffers input whenever a loop is being read and searches the internal buffer to do the re-reading implied by the loop. To the extent that this is allowed, backward goto s succeed on inputs that you cannot search.

## Operating system security

The goal of computer security is the protection of information stored on the computer system.

Information security is aimed at the following:

| Item         | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integrity    | The value of all information depends upon its accuracy. If unauthorized changes are made to data, this data loses some or all of its value. |
| Privacy      | The value of much information depends upon its secrecy.                                                                                     |
| Availability | Information must be readily available.                                                                                                      |

It is helpful to plan and implement your security policies before you begin using the system. Security policies are very time-consuming to change later, so up-front planning can save a lot of time later.

## Identi fi cation and authentication

Identi fi cation and authentication establish your identity.

You are required to log in to the system. You supply your user name and a password if the account has one (in a secure system, all accounts should either have passwords or be invalidated). If the password is correct, you are logged in to that account; you acquire the access rights and privileges of the account.

Because the password is the only protection for your account, select and guard your password carefully. Many attempts to break into a system start with attempts to guess passwords. The operating system provides signi fi cant password protection by storing user passwords separately from other user information. The encrypted passwords and other security-relevant data for users are stored in the /etc/ security/passwd fi le. This fi le should be accessible only by the root user. With this restricted access to the encrypted passwords, an attacker cannot decipher the password with a program that simply cycles through all possible or likely passwords.

It is still possible to guess passwords by repeatedly attempting to log in to an account. If the password is trivial or is infrequently changed, such attempts might easily succeed.

## Login user IDs

The operating system can identify users by their login user ID .

The login user ID allows the system to trace all user actions to their source. After a user logs in to the system and before the initial user program is run, the system sets the login ID of the process to the user ID found in the user database. All subsequent processes during the login session are tagged with this ID. These tags provide a trail of all activities performed by the login user ID.

You can reset the effective user ID , real user ID , effective group ID , real group ID , and supplementary group ID during the session, but you cannot change the login user ID.

## Unattended terminals

All systems are vulnerable if terminals are left logged in and unattended. The most serious problem occurs when a system manager leaves a terminal unattended that has been enabled with root authority. In general, users should log out anytime they leave their terminals.

You can force a terminal to log out after a period of inactivity by setting the TMOUT and TIMEOUT parameters in the /etc/profile fi le. The TMOUT parameter works in the ksh (Korn) shell, and the TIMEOUT parameter works in the bsh (Bourne) shell.

The following example, taken from a .profile fi le, forces the terminal to log out after an hour of inactivity:

```
TO=3600 echo "Setting Autologout to $TO" TIMEOUT=$TO TMOUT=$TO export TIMEOUT TMOUT
```

Note: You can override the TMOUT and TIMEOUT values in the /etc/profile fi le by specifying different values in the .profile fi le in your home directory.

Parameter substitution in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

The Korn shell, or POSIX shell, lets you perform parameter substitutions.

## File ownership and user groups

Initially, a fi le's owner is identi fi ed by the user ID of the person who created the fi le.

The owner of a fi le determines who may read, write (modify), or execute the fi le. Ownership can be changed with the chown command.

Every user ID is assigned to a group with a unique group ID. The system manager creates the groups of users when setting up the system. When a new fi le is created, the operating system assigns permissions to the user ID that created it, to the group ID containing the fi le owner, and to a group called others , consisting of all other users. The id command shows your user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and the names of all groups you belong to.

In fi le listings (such as the listings shown by the ls command), the groups of users are always represented in the following order: user, group, and others. If you need to fi nd out your group name, the groups command shows all the groups for a user ID.

## Changing fi le or directory ownership

Use the chown command to change the owner of your fi les.

When you specify the -R option, the chown command recursively descends through the directory structure from the speci fi ed directory. When symbolic links are encountered, the ownership of the fi le or directory pointed to by the link is changed; the ownership of the symbolic link is not changed.

Note: Only the root user can change the owner of another fi le. Errors are not displayed when the -f option is speci fi ed.

For example, to change the owner of the program.c fi le, type the following:

chown jim program.c

The user-access permissions for the program.c fi le now apply to jim . As the owner, jim can use the chmod command to permit or deny other users access to the program.c fi le.

See the chown command for the complete syntax.

## File and directory access modes

Every fi le has an owner. For new fi les, the user who creates the fi le is the owner of that fi le. The owner assigns an access mode to the fi le. Access modes grant other system users permission to read, modify, or execute the fi le. Only the fi le's owner or users with root authority can change the access mode of a fi le.

There are the three classes of users: user/owner, group, and all others. Access is granted to these user classes in some combination of three modes: read, write, or execute. When a new fi le is created, the default permissions are read, write, and execute permission for the user who created the fi le. The other two groups have read and execute permission. The following table illustrates the default fi le-access modes for the three classes of user groups:

|         | Description   |       | Item       |
|---------|---------------|-------|------------|
| Classes | Read          | Write | Execute    |
| Yes     |               | Yes   | Owner Yes  |
| Yes     |               | No    | Group Yes  |
| Yes     |               | No    | Others Yes |

The system determines who has permission and the level of permission they have for each of these activities. Access modes are represented both symbolically and numerically in the operating system.

## Related concepts

Types of fi les

The types of fi les recognized by the system are either regular , directory , or special . However, the operating system uses many variations of these basic types.

Symbolic representation of access modes Access modes are represented symbolically.

## Ite Description

m

- r Indicates read permission, which allows users to view the contents of a fi le.
- w Indicates write permission, which allows users to modify the contents of a fi le.
- x Indicates execute permission. For executable fi les (ordinary fi les that contain programs), execute permission means that the program can be run. For directories, execute permission means the contents of the directory can be searched.

The access modes for fi les or directories are represented by nine characters. The fi rst three characters represent the current Owner permissions, the second sent of three characters represents the current Group permissions, and the third set of three characters represents the current settings for the Other permissions. A hyphen ( -) in the nine-character set indicates that no permission is given. For example, a fi le with the access modes set to rwxr-xr-x gives read and execute permission to all three groups and write permission only to the owner of the fi le. This is the symbolic representation of the default setting.

The ls command, when used with the -l (lower case L) flag, gives a detailed listing of the current directory. The fi rst 10 characters in the ls -l listing show the fi le type and permissions for each of the three groups. The ls -l command also lists the owner and group associated with each fi le and directory.

The fi rst character indicates the type of fi le. The remaining nine characters contain the fi le permission information for each of the three classes of users. The following symbols are used to represent the type of fi le:

## Ite m Description

- -Regular fi les
- d Directory
- b Block special fi les
- c Character special fi les
- p Pipe special fi les
- l Symbolic links
- s Sockets

For example, this is a sample ls -l listing:

```
-rwxrwxr-x 2 janet acct 512 Mar 01 13:33 january
```

Here, the fi rst hyphen (-) indicates a regular fi le. The next nine characters ( rwxrwxr-x represent the User, Group, and Other access modes, as discussed above. janet is the fi le owner, and acct is the name of Janet's group. 512 is the fi le size in bytes, Mar 01 13:33 is the last date and time of modi fi cation, and january is the fi le name. The 2 indicates how many links exist to the fi le.

## Numeric representation of access modes

Numerically, read access is represented by a value of 4, write permission is represented by a value of 2, and execute permission is represented by a value of 1. The total value between 1 and 7 represents the access mode for each group (user, group, and other).

The following table illustrates the numeric values for each level of access:

|   Total Value | Read   | Write   | Execute   |
|---------------|--------|---------|-----------|
|             0 | -      | -       | -         |
|             1 | -      | -       | 1         |
|             2 | -      | 2       | -         |
|             3 | -      | 2       | 1         |
|             4 | 4      | -       | -         |
|             5 | 4      | -       | 1         |
|             6 | 4      | 2       | -         |
|             7 | 4      | 2       | 1         |

When a fi le is created, the default fi le access mode is 755 . This means the user has read, write, and execute permissions (4+2+1=7) , the group has read and execute permission (4+1=5) , and all others have read and execute permission (4+1=5) . To change access permission modes for fi les you own, run the chmod (change mode) command.

## Displaying group information

Use the lsgroup command to display the attributes of all the groups on the system (or of speci fi ed groups). If one or more attributes cannot be read, the lsgroup command lists as much information as possible.

The attribute information displays as Attribute = Value de fi nitions, each separated by a blank space.

1. To list all of the groups on the system, type the following:

lsgroup ALL

The system displays each group, group ID, and all of the users in the group in a list similar to the following:

```
system 0 arne,pubs,ctw,geo,root,chucka,noer,su,dea,backup,build,janice,denise staff 1 john,ryan,flynn,daveb,jzitt,glover,maple,ken,gordon,mbrady bin 2 root,bin sys 3 root,su,bin,sys
```

2. To display speci fi c attributes for all groups, do either of the following:
- You can list attributes in the form Attribute = Value separated by a blank space. This is the default style. For example, to list the ID and users for all of the groups on the system, type the following:

lsgroup -a id users ALL | pg A list similar to the following is displayed: system id=0 users=arne,pubs,ctw,geo,root,chucka,noer,su,dea,backup,build staff id=1 users=john,ryan,flynn,daveb,jzitt,glover,maple,ken

- You can also list the information in stanza format. For example, to list the ID and users for all of the groups on the system in stanza format, type the following:

```
lsgroup -a -f id users ALL | pg
```

A list similar to the following is displayed:

```
system:
```

```
id=0 users=pubs,ctw,geo,root,chucka,noer,su,dea,backup,build staff: id=1 users=john,ryan,flynn,daveb,jzitt,glover,maple,ken
```

```
bin: id=2 users=root,bin sys: id=3 users=root,su,bin,sys
```

3. To display all attributes for a speci fi c group, you can use one of two styles for listing speci fi c attributes for all groups:
- You can list each attribute in the form Attribute = Value separated by a blank space. This is the default style. For example, to list all attributes for the group system, type the following:

```
lsgroup system
```

A list similar to the following is displayed:

system id=0 users=arne,pubs,ctw,geo,root,chucka,noer,su,dea,backup,build,janice,denise

- You can also list the information in stanza format. For example, to list all attributes for the group bin in stanza format, type the following:
4. To list speci fi c attributes for a speci fi c group, type the following:

```
lsgroup -f system A list similar to the following is displayed: system: id=0 users=arne,pubs,ctw,geo,root,chucka,noer,su,dea,backup,build,janice,denise
```

```
lsgroup -a Attributes Group For example, to list the ID and users for group bin , type the following: lsgroup -a id users bin A list similar to the following is displayed: bin id=2 users=root,bin
```

See the lsgroup command for the complete syntax.

## Changing fi le or directory permissions

Use the chmod command to change the permissions of your fi les.

1. To add a type of permission to the chap1 and chap2 fi les, type the following:

```
chmod g+w chap1 chap2
```

This adds write permission for group members to the fi les chap1 and chap2 .

2. To make several permission changes at once to the mydir directory, type the following:

```
chmod go-w+x mydir
```

This denies ( -) group members ( g ) and others ( o ) the permission to create or delete fi les ( w ) in the mydir directory and allows ( + ) group members and others to search the mydir directory or use ( x ) it in a path name. This is equivalent to the following command sequence:

```
chmod g-w mydir chmod o-w mydir chmod g+x mydir chmod o+x mydir
```

3. To permit only the owner to use a shell procedure named cmd as a command, type the following:

```
chmod u=rwx,go= cmd
```

This gives read, write, and execute permission to the user who owns the fi le ( u=rwx ). It also denies the group and others the permission to access cmd in any way ( go= ).

4. To use the numeric mode form of the chmod command to change the permissions of the text , fi le type the following:

```
chmod 644 text
```

This sets read and write permission for the owner, and it sets read-only mode for the group and others.

See the chmod command for the complete syntax.

## Access control lists

Access control consists of protected information resources that specify who can be granted access to such resources.

The operating system allows for need-to-know or discretionary security. The owner of an information resource can grant other users read or write access rights for that resource. A user who is granted access rights to a resource can transfer those rights to other users. This security allows for user-controlled information flow in the system; the owner of an information resource de fi nes the access permissions to the object.

Users have user-based access only to the objects that they own. Typically, users receive either the group permissions or the default permissions for a resource. The major task in administering access control is to de fi ne the group memberships of users, because these memberships determine the users' access rights to the fi les that they do not own.

## Access control lists for fi le system objects

File system objects are typically associated with an Access Control List (ACL), which normally consists of series of Access Control Entries (ACEs). Each ACE de fi nes the identity and its related access rights.

To maintain access control lists, use the aclget , acledit , aclput and aclconvert commands.

Note that ACL is typically stored and managed on the media by the physical fi le system (PFS). The AIX operating system provides an infrastructure for physical fi le systems to support and manage multiple ACL types. The JFS2 fi le system shipped with AIX supports two ACL types:

- AIXC
- NFS4

Earlier fi le systems supported only the AIXC ACL type as in the previous AIX releases. These ACL types are discussed in detail in the Security.

## AIXC access control list type

The AIXC (AIX Classic) ACL type provides for the ACL behavior as de fi ned on previous releases of AIX. This ACL type consists of the regular base mode bits and extended permissions (ACEs).

With extended permissions, you can permit or deny fi le access to speci fi c individuals or groups without changing the base permissions.

Note: The AIXC ACL for a fi le cannot exceed one memory page (approximately 4096 bytes) in size.

The chmod command in numeric mode (with octal notations) can set base permissions and attributes. The chmod subroutine, which the command calls, disables extended permissions. Extended permissions are disabled if you use the numeric mode of the chmod command on a fi le that has an ACL. The symbolic mode of the chmod command does not disable extended permissions when the ACL associated is of type AIXC. For more information on numeric and symbolic mode, refer to the chmod command. For information about the chmod command, see chmod .

## Base permissions

AIXC ACL speci fi c base permissions are the traditional fi le-access modes assigned to the fi le owner, fi le group, and other users. The access modes are read ( r ), write ( w ), and execute/search ( x ).

Note: AIXC ACL type Base Permissions will be same as the fi le mode bits stored in the fi le system object's inode headers. That is, the information in base mode bits is same as the value returned by fi le system when stat is performed on the fi le system object.

In an access control list, base permissions are in the following format, with the Mode parameter expressed as rwx (with a hyphen (-) replacing each unspeci fi ed permission):

```
base permissions: owner(name): Mode group(group): Mode others: Mode
```

## Attributes

Three attributes can be added to an access control list:

## setuid (SUID)

Set-user-ID mode bit. This attribute sets the effective and saved user IDs of the process to the owner ID of the fi le on execution.

## setgid (SGID)

Set-group-ID mode bit. This attribute sets the effective and saved group IDs of the process to the group ID of the fi le on execution.

## savetext (SVTX)

Saves the text in a text fi le format.

The above attributes are added in the following format:

```
attributes: SUID, SGID, SVTX
```

## Extended permissions

AIXC ACL extended permissions allow the owner of a fi le to more precisely de fi ne access to that fi le. Extended permissions modify the base fi le permissions (owner, group, others) by permitting, denying, or specifying access modes for speci fi c individuals, groups, or user and group combinations. Permissions are modi fi ed through the use of keywords.

The permit, deny, and specify keywords are de fi ned as follows:

## permit

Grants the user or group the speci fi ed access to the fi le

## deny

Restricts the user or group from using the speci fi ed access to the fi le

## specify

Precisely de fi nes the fi le access for the user or group

If a user is denied a particular access by either a deny or a specify keyword, no other entry can override that access denial.

The enabled keyword must be speci fi ed in the ACL for the extended permissions to take effect. The default value is the disabled keyword.

In an AIXC ACL, extended permissions are in the following format:

```
extended permissions: enabled | disabled permit Mode UserInfo...: deny Mode UserInfo...: specify Mode UserInfo...:
```

Use a separate line for each permit, deny, or specify entry. The Mode parameter is expressed as rwx (with a hyphen (-) replacing each unspeci fi ed permission). The UserInfo parameter is

expressed as u:UserName , or g:GroupName , or a comma-separated combination of u:UserName and g:GroupName .

Note: If more than one user name is speci fi ed in an entry, that entry cannot be used in an access control decision because a process has only one user ID.

## NFS4 access control list type

JFS2 fi le system in AIX also supports NFS4 ACL type. This ACL implementation follows the ACL de fi nition as speci fi ed in NFS4 version 4 protocol related RFC.

This ACL provides much fi ner granular control over the access rights and also provides for features such as inheritance. NFS4 ACL consists of an array of ACEs. Each ACE de fi nes access rights for an identity. As de fi ned in the RFC, the main components of NFS4 ACE are as follows:

```
struct nfsace4 { acetype4 type; aceflag4 flag; acemask4 access_mask; utf8str_mixed who; };
```

Where:

## type

Bit mask that de fi nes the type of the ACE. Details such as whether this ACE allows access or denies access are de fi ned here.

## flag

Bit mask that describes the inheritance aspects of the ACE. De fi nes whether this ACE is applicable to the fi le system object, or its children, or both.

## access\_mask

Bit mask that de fi nes various access rights possible. Rights de fi ned include, read, write, execute, create, delete, create child, delete child, etc.

## who

This null-terminated string de fi nes the identity of the person to which this ACE will apply. Note that per RFC, the size of this string is unlimited, and a loose de fi nition allows for de fi ning domains within NFS version 4 networks to manage access control. Natively (most of the time) AIX does not interpret this string, and each ACE is associated with an AIX-understood identity (such as uid or gid ). It is expected that the NFS version 4 fi le system will interpret these strings as necessary to convert them to OS-understood user or group IDs. AIX only understands some of the special who strings de fi ned in the RFC.

In AIX, use the aclget , acledit , aclput and aclconvert commands to manage NFS4 ACLs.

Note: Any type of chmod command will erase the fi le's ACL.

## Access control list example for AIXC

The following is an example of an AIXC access control list (ACL).

The following is an example of an AIXC ACL:

```
attributes: SUID base permissions: owner(frank): rwgroup(system): r-x others: ---extended permissions: enabled permit rwu:dhs deny r-u:chas, g:system specify r-u:john, g:gateway, g:mail permit rwg:account, g:finance
```

The parts of the ACL and their meanings are as follows:

- The fi rst line indicates that the setuid bit is turned on.

- The next line, which introduces the base permissions, is optional.
- The next three lines specify the base permissions. The owner and group names in parentheses are for information only. Changing these names does not alter the fi le owner or fi le group. Only the chown command and the chgrp command can change these fi le attributes.
- The next line, which introduces the extended permissions, is optional.
- The next line indicates that the extended permissions that follow are enabled.
- The last four lines are the extended entries.
- The fi rst extended entry grants user dhs read ( r ) and write ( w ) permission on the fi le.
- The second extended entry denies read ( r ) access to user chas only when he is a member of the system group.
- The third extended entry speci fi es that as long as user john is a member of both the gateway group and the mail group, this user has read ( r ) access. If user john is not a member of both groups, this extended permission does not apply.
- The last extended entry grants any user in both the account group and the finance group read ( r ) and write ( w ) permission.

Note: More than one extended entry can be applied to a process, with restrictive modes taking precedence over permissive modes.

See the acledit command for the complete syntax.

## Access control list access authorization

The owner of the information resource is responsible for managing access rights. Resources are protected by permission bits, which are included in the mode of the object.

For AIXC ACL, the permission bits de fi ne the access permissions granted to the owner of the object, the group of the object, and for the others default class. AIXC ACL type supports three different modes of access (read, write, and execute) that can be granted separately.

When a user logs in to an account (using the login or su command), the user IDs and group IDs assigned to that account are associated with the user's processes. These IDs determine the access rights of the process.

For fi les, directories, named pipes, and devices (special fi les) with an associated AIX ACL, access is authorized as follows:

- For each access control entry (ACE) in the access control list (ACL), the identi fi er list is compared to the identi fi ers of the process. If there is a match, the process receives the permissions and restrictions de fi ned for that entry. The logical unions for both permissions and restrictions are computed for each matching entry in the ACL. If the requesting process does not match any of the entries in the ACL, it receives the permissions and restrictions of the default entry.
- If the requested access mode is permitted (included in the union of the permissions) and is not restricted (included in the union of the restrictions), access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.

Further, for an AIXC ACL type, the identi fi er list of an ACL matches a process if all identi fi ers in the list match the corresponding type of effective identi fi er for the requesting process. A USER-type identi fi er matched is equal to the effective user ID of the process, and a GROUP-type identi fi er matches if it is equal to the effective group ID of the process or to one of the supplementary group IDs. For instance, an ACE with an identi fi er list such as the following:

USER:fred, GROUP:philosophers, GROUP:software\_programmer would match a process with an effective user ID of fred and a group set of:

philosophers, philanthropists, software\_programmer, doc\_design but would not match for a process with an effective user ID of fred and a group set of:

philosophers, iconoclasts, hardware\_developer, graphic\_design

Note that an ACE with an identi fi er list of the following would match for both processes:

```
USER:fred, GROUP:philosophers
```

In other words, the identi fi er list in the ACE functions is a set of conditions that must hold for the speci fi ed access to be granted.

The discretionary access control mechanism allows for effective access control of information resources and provides for separate protection of the con fi dentiality and integrity of the information. Ownercontrolled access control mechanisms are only as effective as users make them. All users must understand how access permissions are granted and denied, and how these are set.

Note that fi le system objects with an associated NFS4 ACL type, access checks are based on various ACEs that form the ACL as per the rules setup in the NFS version 4 protocol-related RFC. Identity matching is done based on the user ID or group ID or special who strings de fi ned in the ACE against the process's credentials. If a match occurs, the access rights requested are checked against the access rights de fi ned in the ACE. If any of the access rights are allowed, those will be taken out, and the compare operation continues on to the next ACE. This process is continued until either the ACL end is reached, or all the access rights are met, or if any of the access rights requested are denied. The following steps capture the access checking in the case of a fi le system object with an associated NFS4 ACL:

1. For each access control entry (ACE) in the access control list (ACL), the identi fi er list is compared to the identi fi ers of the process. Identity checks include the user ID or group ID de fi ned in the ACE. Also, if the identity is de fi ned as special with strings such as OWNER@ , a match will occur if the calling process is by the owner of the fi le. If there is a match, the process receives the access rights de fi ned for that entry. Else, continue to the next ACE.
2. Requested access rights are compared with the access rights retrieved from ACE entry. If any of the access rights requested are explicitly denied by the ACE, then the access checking process is ended, and the requesting process will be denied access.
3. If some of the requested access rights are met by the ACE, then those access rights will be taken out from the requests access rights list, and the compare operation continues to the next ACE.
4. If all of the requested access rights are met by the ACEs, then the requested access is allowed.
5. If ACL end is reached before all of the requested access rights are resolved, then the access is denied.

Note that apart from the ACL type-based access checks, individual physical fi le systems might also choose to provide for privilege-based access to the fi le system objects. For example, an owner might always at least have the permission to modify the ACL, irrespective of the existing ACL access rights. A process with a user ID of 0 is known as a root user process. These processes are generally allowed all access permissions. However, if a root user process requests execute permission for a program, access is granted only if execute permission is granted to at least one user.

All access permission checks for these objects are made at the system call level when the object is fi rst accessed. Because System V Interprocess Communication (SVIPC) objects are accessed statelessly, checks are made for every access. However, it is possible that checks are made by the physical fi le systems at open time of the fi le system object and not at the time of read or write operation. For objects with fi le system names, it is necessary to be able to resolve the name of the actual object. Names are resolved either relatively (to the process' working directory) or absolutely (to the process' root directory). All name resolution begins by searching one of these.

## Command for displaying access control information (aclget command)

The aclget command displays the access control information of a fi le. The information that you view includes attributes, base permissions, and extended permissions.

For example, to display the access control information for the status fi le, type the following:

aclget status

The access control information that displays includes a list of attributes, base permissions, and extended permissions.

## Related concepts

Access control list example and description The following is an example and description of access control lists (ACLs).

## Setting access control information (aclput command)

To set the access control information for a fi le, use the aclput command.

Note: The access control list for a fi le cannot exceed one memory page (approximately 4096 bytes) in size.

See the following examples:

For example, to set the access control information for the status fi le with the access control information stored in the acldefs fi le, type the following:

```
aclput -i acldefs status To set the access control information for the status fi le with the same information used for the plans fi le,
```

type the following:

```
aclget plans | aclput status
```

## Access control list example and description

The following is an example and description of access control lists (ACLs).

The following is an example of an ACL:

```
g:mail
```

```
attributes: SUID base permissions: owner(frank): rwgroup(system): r-x others: ---extended permissions: enabled permit rwu:dhs deny r-u:chas, g:system specify r-u:john, g:gateway, permit rwg:account, g:finance
```

The parts of the ACL and their meanings are the following:

- The fi rst line indicates that the setuid bit is turned on.
- The next line, which introduces the base permissions, is optional.
- The next three lines specify the base permissions. The owner and group names in parentheses are for information only. Changing these names does not alter the fi le owner or fi le group. Only the chown command and the chgrp command can change these fi le attributes.
- The next line, which introduces the extended permissions, is optional.
- The next line indicates that the extended permissions that follow are enabled.
- The last four lines are the extended entries. The fi rst extended entry grants user dhs read ( r ) and write ( w ) permission on the fi le.
- The second extended entry denies read ( r ) access to user chas only when he is a member of the system group.
- The third extended entry speci fi es that as long as user john is a member of both the gateway group and the mail group, has read ( r ) access. If user john is not a member of both groups, this extended permission does not apply.
- The last extended entry grants any user in both the account group and the finance group read ( r ) and write ( w ) permission.

Note: More than one extended entry can be applied to a process, with restrictive modes taking precedence over permissive modes.

See the acledit command for the complete syntax.

## Related tasks

Editing access control information (acledit command)

Use the acledit command to change the access control information of a fi le. The command displays the current access control information and lets the fi le owner change it.

## Editing access control information (acledit command)

Use the acledit command to change the access control information of a fi le. The command displays the current access control information and lets the fi le owner change it.

Before making any permanent changes, the acledit command asks if you want to proceed.

Note: The EDITOR environment variable must be speci fi ed with a complete path name; otherwise, the acledit command will fail.

The access control information that displays is ACL type speci fi c and includes a list of attributes, base permissions, and extended permissions.

For example, to edit the access control information of the plans fi le, type the following:

```
acledit plans
```

## Locking your terminal (lock or xlock command)

Use the lock command to lock your terminal. The lock command requests your password, reads it, and requests the password a second time to verify it.

In the interim, the command locks the terminal and does not relinquish it until the password is received the second time. The timeout default value is 15 minutes, but this can be changed with the -Number flag.

Note: If your interface is AIXwindows, use the xlock command in the same manner.

For example, to lock your terminal under password control, type the following:

lock

You are prompted for the password twice so the system can verify it. If the password is not repeated within 15 minutes, the command times out.

To reserve a terminal under password control with a timeout interval of 10 minutes, type the following:

```
lock -10
```

## Authentication

The xlock command is a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) enabled X server command that locks the X server until the user enters a password. It supports both local UNIX authentication and PAM authentication for unlocking the X server.

You can set the system-wide con fi guration to use PAM for authentication by providing root user access and by modifying the value of the auth\_type attribute to PAM\_AUTH in the usw stanza of the /etc/ security/login.cfg fi le.

The authentication mechanisms that are used when PAM is enabled are dependent on the con fi guration of the login service in the /etc/pam.conf fi le. The xlock command requires

the /etc/pam.conf fi le entry for the auth , account , password , and session module types. The following con fi guration is recommended for the /etc/pam.conf fi le entry in the xlock command:

| xlock   | auth     | required   | pam_aix   |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
| xlock   | account  | required   | pam_aix   |
| xlock   | password | required   | pam_aix   |
| xlock   | session  | required   | pam_aix   |

## System devices list (lscfg command)

To display the name, location, and description of each device found in the current con fi guration, use the lscfg command. The list is sorted by device location.

For example, to list the devices con fi gured in your system, at the prompt, type the following:

lscfg

The system displays output similar to the following:

```
INSTALLED RESOURCE LIST The following resources are installed on your machine. +/- = Added/Deleted from Diagnostic Test List. * = NOT Supported by Diagnostics. Model Architecture: chrp Model Implementation: Multiple Processor, PCI bus + sysplanar0 00-00 CPU Planar + fpa0 00-00 Floating Point Processor + mem0 00-0A Memory Card + mem1 00-0B Memory Card + ioplanar0 00-00 I/O Planar + rs2320 00-01 RS232 Card + tty0 00-01-0-01 RS232 Card Port - tty1 00-01-0-02 RS232 Card Port .. .. ..
```

The device list is not sorted by device location alone. It is sorted by the parent/child hierarchy. If the parent has multiple children, the children are sorted by device location. If the children have the same device location, they are displayed in the order in which they were obtained by the software. To display

information about a speci fi c device, you can use the -l flag. For example, to list the information on device sysplanar0 , at the prompt, type the following:

```
lscfg -l sysplanar0
```

The system displays output similar to the following:

```
DEVICE LOCATION DESCRIPTION sysplanar0 00-00 CPU Planar
```

You can also use the lscfg command to display vital product data (VPD), such as part numbers, serial numbers, and engineering change levels. For some devices, the VPD is collected automatically and added to the system con fi guration. For other devices, the VPD is typed manually. An ME preceding the data indicates that the data was typed manually.

For example, to list VPD for devices con fi gured in your system, at the prompt, type the following:

lscfg -v

The system displays output similar to the following:

```
INSTALLED RESOURCE LIST WITH VPD The following resources are installed in your machine. Model Architecture: chrp Model Implementation: Multiple Processor, PCI bus sysplanar0 00-00 CPU Planar Part Number.........342522 EC Level............254921 Serial Number.......353535 fpa0 00-00 Floating Point Processor mem0 00-0A Memory Card EC Level............990221 . . .
```

## Displaying console names

To write the name of the current console device to standard output (usually your screen), use the lscons command.

For example, at the prompt, type the following:

lscons

The system displays output similar to the following:

/dev/lft0

See the lscons command for the complete syntax.

## Displaying the terminal name (tty command)

To display the name of your terminal, use the tty command.

For example, at the prompt, type the following:

tty

The system displays information similar to the following:

/dev/tty06

In this example, tty06 is the name of the terminal, and /dev/tty06 is the device fi le that contains the interface to this terminal.

## Listing available displays (lsdisp command)

To list the displays currently available on your system, providing a display identi fi cation name, slot number, display name, and description of each of the displays, use the lsdisp command.

For example, to list all available displays, type the following:

lsdisp

The following is an example of the output. The list displays in ascending order according to slot number.

## Listing available fonts (lsfont command)

To display a list of the fonts available to your display, use the lsfont command.

For example, to list all fonts available to the display, type the following:

lsfont

The following is an example of the output, showing the font identi fi er, fi le name, glyph size, and font encoding:

| FONT    | FILE                | GLYPH      | FONT               |
|---------|---------------------|------------|--------------------|
| ID ==== | NAME ============== | SIZE ===== | ENCODING ========= |
| 0       | Erg22.iso1.snf      | 12x30      | ISO8859-1          |
|         | Erg11.iso1.snf      | 8x15       |                    |
| 1       |                     |            | ISO8859-1          |

## Listing the current software keyboard map (lskbd command)

To display the absolute path name of the current software keyboard map loaded into the system, use the lskbd command.

For example, to list your current keyboard map, type the following:

```
lskbd The following is an example of the listing displayed by the lskbd command: The current software keyboard map = /usr/lib/nls/loc/C.lftkeymap
```

## Listing available software products (lslpp command)

To display information about software products available on your system, use the lslpp command.

For example, to list all the software products in your system, at the system prompt, type the following:

```
lslpp -l -a
```

The following is an example of the output:

```
Fileset Level State Description ----------------------------------------------------Path: /usr/lib/objrepos X11_3d.gl.dev.obj APPLIED AIXwindows/3D GL Development Utilities Fonts X11fnt.oldX.fnt APPLIED AIXwindows Miscellaneous X Fonts X11mEn_US.msg APPLIED AIXwindows NL Message files . . .
```

If the listing is very long, the top portion may scroll off the screen. To display the listing one page (screen) at a time, use the lslpp command piped to the pg command. At the prompt, type the following:

```
lslpp -l -a | pg
```

## List of control key assignments for your terminal (stty command)

To display your terminal settings, use the stty command. Note especially which keys your terminal uses for control keys.

For example, at the prompt, type the following:

```
stty -a The system displays information similar to the following: . . . intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = ^@ start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; dsusp = ^Y; reprint = ^R discard = ^O; werase = ^W; lnext = ^V . . .
```

In this example, lines such as intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; display your control key settings. The ^H key is the Backspace key, and it is set to perform the erase function.

If the listing is very long, the top portion may scroll off the screen. To display the listing one page (screen) at a time, use the stty command piped to the pg command. At the prompt, type the following:

```
stty -a | pg
```

## Related concepts

Foreground process cancellation

If you start a foreground process and then decide that you do not want it to fi nish, you can cancel it by pressing INTERRUPT. This is usually Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Backspace.

## Listing environment variables (env command)

To display your current environment variables, use the env command. An environment variable that is accessible to all your processes is called a global variable .

For example, to list all environment variables and their associated values, type the following:

env

The following is an example of the output:

```
TMPDIR=/usr/tmp myid=denise LANG=En_US UNAME=barnard PAGER=/bin/pg VISUAL=vi PATH=/usr/ucb:/usr/lpp/X11/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/u/denise:/u/denise/bin:/u/bin1 MAILPATH=/usr/mail/denise?denise has mail !!! MAILRECORD=/u/denise/.Outmail EXINIT=set beautify noflash nomesg report=1 showmode showmatch EDITOR=vi PSCH=> HISTFILE=/u/denise/.history LOGNAME=denise MAIL=/usr/mail/denise PS1=denise@barnard:${PWD}> PS3=# PS2=> epath=/usr/bin USER=denise SHELL=/bin/ksh HISTSIZE=500 HOME=/u/denise FCEDIT=vi TERM=lft MAILMSG=**YOU HAVE NEW MAIL. USE THE mail COMMAND TO SEE YOUR PWD=/u/denise ENV=/u/denise/.env
```

If the listing is very long, the top portion scrolls off the screen. To display the listing one page (screen) at a time, use the env command piped to the pg command. At the prompt, type the following:

```
env | pg
```

## Displaying an environment variable value (printenv command)

To display the values of environment variables, use the printenv command.

If you specify the Name parameter, the system only prints the value associated with the variable you requested. If you do not specify the Name parameter, the printenv command displays all current environment variables, showing one Name = Value sequence per line.

For example, to fi nd the current setting of the MAILMSG environment variable, type the following:

```
printenv MAILMSG
```

The command returns the value of the MAILMSG environment variable. For example:

```
YOU HAVE NEW MAIL
```

## Bidirectional languages (aixterm command)

The aixterm command supports Arabic and Hebrew, which are bidirectional languages.

Bidirectional languages have the ability to be read and written in two directions: from left to right and from right to left. You can work with Arabic and Hebrew applications by opening a window specifying an Arabic or Hebrew locale.

## Command summary for user environment and system information

The following are commands for user environment and system information.

| Item     | Description                                                                             |

| tty      | Displays the full path name of your terminal                                            |

## User environment customization

The operating system provides various commands and initialization fi les that enable you to customize the behavior and the appearance of your user environment.

You can also customize some of the default resources of the applications you use on your system. Defaults are initiated by the program at startup. When you change the defaults, you must exit and then restart the program for the new defaults take effect.

For information about customizing the behavior and appearance of the Common Desktop Environment, see the Common Desktop Environment 1.0: Advanced User's and System Administrator's Guide .

## System startup fi les

When you log in, the shell de fi nes your user environment after reading the initialization fi les that you have set up. The characteristics of your user environment are de fi ned by the values given to your environment variables. You maintain this environment until you log out of the system.

The shell uses two types of pro fi le fi les when you log in to the operating system. It evaluates the commands contained in the fi les and then executes the commands to set up your system environment. The fi les have similar functions, except that the /etc/profile fi le controls pro fi le variables for all users on a system, whereas the .profile fi le allows you to customize your own environment.

The shell fi rst runs the commands to set up your system environment in the /etc/environment fi le and then evaluates the commands contained in the /etc/profile fi le. After these fi les are run, the system then checks to see if you have a .profile fi le in your home directory. If the .profile fi le exists, the system runs this fi le. The .profile fi le will specify if an environment fi le also exists. If an environment fi le exists (usually named .env ), the system then runs this fi le and sets up your environment variables.

The /etc/environment , /etc/profile , and .profile fi les are run once at login time. The .env fi le, on the other hand, is run every time you open a new shell or a window.

## /etc/environment fi le

The fi rst fi le that the operating system uses at login time is the /etc/environment fi le. The /etc/ environment fi le contains variables specifying the basic environment for all processes.

When a new process begins, the exec subroutine makes an array of strings available that have the form Name = Value . This array of strings is called the environment . Each name de fi ned by one of the strings is called an environment variable or shell variable . The exec subroutine allows the entire environment to be set at one time.

When you log in, the system sets environment variables from the /etc/environment fi le before reading your login pro fi le, named .profile . The following variables make up the basic environment:

| Item    | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HOME    | The full path name of the user's login or HOME directory. The login program sets this to the name speci fi ed in the /etc/passwd fi le.         |
| LANG    | The locale name currently in effect. The LANG variable is initially set in the /etc/profile fi le at installation time.                         |
| NLSPATH | The full path name for message catalogs.                                                                                                        |
| LOCPATH | The full path name of the location of National Language Support tables.                                                                         |
| PATH    | The sequence of directories that commands, such as sh , time , nice and nohup, search when looking for a command whose path name is incomplete. |
| TZ      | The time zone information. The TZ environment variable is initially set by the /etc/profile fi le, the system login pro fi le.                  |

For detailed information about the /etc/environment fi le, see the Files Reference .

## /etc/pro fi le fi le

The second fi le that the operating system uses at login time is the /etc/profile fi le.

The /etc/profile fi le controls system-wide default variables, such as:

- Export variables
- File creation mask (umask)
- Terminal types
- Mail messages to indicate when new mail has arrived

The system administrator con fi gures the /etc/profile fi le for all users on the system. Only the system administrator can change this fi le.

The following example is a typical /etc/profile fi le:

```
#Set file creation mask sequence
```

```
umask 022 #Tell me when new mail arrives MAIL=/usr/mail/$LOGNAME #Add my /bin directory to the shell search PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/etc:: #Set terminal type TERM=lft #Make some environment variables global export MAIL PATH TERM
```

For detailed information about the /etc/profile fi le, see the Files Reference .

## .pro fi le fi le

The .profile fi le is present in your home ( $HOME ) directory and lets you customize your individual working environment.

Because the .profile fi le is hidden, use the ls -a command to list it.

After the login program adds the LOGNAME (login name) and HOME (login directory) variables to the environment, the commands in the $HOME/.profile fi le are executed if the fi le is present. The .profile fi le contains your individual pro fi le that overrides the variables set in the /etc/profile fi le. The .profile fi le is often used to set exported environment variables and terminal modes. You can customize your environment by modifying the .profile fi le. Use the .profile fi le to control the following defaults:

- Shells to open
- Prompt appearance
- Keyboard sound

The following example is a typical .profile fi le:

```
PATH=/usr/bin:/etc:/home/bin1:/usr/lpp/tps4.0/user:: epath=/home/gsc/e3: export PATH epath csh
```

This example has de fi ned two path variables ( PATH and epath ), exported them, and opened a C shell ( csh ).

You can also use the .profile fi le (or if it is not present, the /etc/profile fi le) to determine login shell variables. You can also customize other shell environments. For example, use the .cshrc fi le and .kshrc fi le to customize a C shell and a Korn shell, respectively, when each type of shell is started.

## .env fi le

A fourth fi le that the operating system uses at login time is the .env fi le, if your .profile contains the following line: export ENV=$HOME/.env

The .env fi le lets you customize your individual working environment variables. Because the .env fi le is hidden, use the ls -a command to list it. For more information about the ls command, see ls . The .env fi le contains the individual user environment variables that override the variables set in the /etc/environment fi le. You can customize your environment variables as desired by modifying your .env fi le.

The following example is a typical .env fi le:

```
export myid=`id | sed -n -e 's/).*$//' -e 's/^.*(//p'` #set prompt: login & system name & path if [ $myid = root ] then typeset -x PSCH='#:\${PWD}> ' PS1="#:\${PWD}> " else typeset -x PSCH='>' PS1="$LOGNAME@$UNAME:\${PWD}> " PS2=">" PS3="#?" fi export PS1 PS2 PS3 #setup my command aliases alias ls="/bin/ls -CF" \ d="/bin/ls -Fal | pg" \ rm="/bin/rm -i" \ up="cd .."
```

Note: When modifying the .env fi le, ensure that newly created environment variables do not conflict with standard variables such as MAIL , PS1 , PS2 , and IFS .

## AIXwindows startup fi les

Different computer systems have different ways of starting the X Server and AIXwindows.

Because different computer systems have different ways of starting the X Server and AIXwindows, consult with your system administrator to learn how to get started. Usually, the X Server and AIXwindows are started from a shell script that runs automatically when you log in. You might, however, fi nd that you need to start the X Server or AIXwindows, or both.

If you log in and fi nd that your display is functioning as a single terminal with no windows displayed, you can start the X Server by typing the following:

```
xinit
```

Note: Before entering this command, make sure that the pointer rests within a window that has a system prompt.

If this command does not start the X Server, check with your system administrator to ensure that your search path contains the X11 directory containing executable programs. The appropriate path might differ from one system to another.

If you log in and fi nd one or more windows without frames, you can start AIXwindows Window Manager by typing the following:

```
mwm &
```

Because AIXwindows permits customization both by programmers writing AIXwindows applications and by users, you might fi nd that mouse buttons or other functions do not operate as you might expect from reading this documentation. You can reset your AIXwindows environment to the default behavior by pressing and holding the following four keys:

## Alt-Ctrl-Shift-!

You can return to the customized behavior by pressing this key sequence again. If your system does not permit this combination of keystrokes, you can also restore default behavior from the default root menu.

## .xinitrc fi le

The xinit command uses a customizable shell script fi le that lists the X Client programs to start. The .xinitrc fi le in your home directory controls the windows and applications that start when you start AIXwindows.

The xinit command works with shell scripts in the following order:

1. The xinit command fi rst looks for the $XINITRC environment variable to start AIXwindows.
2. If the $XINITRC environment variable is not found, the xinit command looks for the $HOME/.xinitrc shell script.
3. If the $HOME/.xinitrc shell script is not found, the xinit command starts the /usr/lib/X11/$LANG/xinitrc shell script.
4. If /usr/lib/X11/$LANG/xinitrc is not found, it looks for the /usr/lpp/X11/defaults / $LANG/xinitrc shell script. If that script is not found, it searches for the /usr/lpp/X11/ defaults/xinitrc shell script.
5. The xinitrc shell script starts commands, such as the mwm (AIXwindows Window Manager), aixterm , and xclock commands.

The xinit command performs the following operations:

- Starts an X Server on the current display
- Sets up the $DISPLAY environment variable
- Runs the xinitrc fi le to start the X Client programs

The following example shows the part of the xinitrc fi le you can customize:

```
# This script is invoked by /usr/lpp/X11/bin/xinit . . . #*************************************************************** # Start the X clients. Change the following lines to * # whatever command(s) you desire! * # The default clients are an analog clock (xclock), an lft * # terminal emulator (aixterm), and the Motif Window Manager *
```

```
# (mwm). *
```

```
#**************************************************************** exec mwm
```

## .Xdefaults fi le

If you work in an AIXwindows interface, you can customize this interface with the .Xdefaults fi le. AIXwindows allows you to specify your preferences for visual characteristics, such as colors and fonts.

Many aspects of Windows operating system based application's appearance and behavior are controlled by sets of variables called resources . The visual or behavioral aspect of a resource is determined by its assigned value. There are several different types of values for resources. For example, resources that control color can be assigned prede fi ned values such as DarkSlateBlue or Black . Resources that specify dimensions are assigned numeric values. Some resources take Boolean values ( True or False ).

If you do not have a .Xdefaults fi le in your home directory, you can create one with any text editor. After you have this fi le in your home directory, you can set resource values in it as you wish. A sample default fi le called Xdefaults.tmpl is in the /usr/lpp/X11/defaults directory.

The following example shows part of a typical .Xdefaults fi le:

```
*AutoRaise: on CornflowerBlue
```

```
*DeIconifyWarp: on *warp:on *TitleFont:andysans12 *scrollBar: true *font: Rom10.500 Mwm*menu*foreground: black Mwm*menu*background: CornflowerBlue Mwm*menu*RootMenu*foreground: black Mwm*menu*RootMenu*background: Mwm*icon*foreground: grey25 Mwm*icon*background: LightGray Mwm*foreground: black Mwm*background: LightSkyBlue Mwm*bottomShadowColor: Blue1 Mwm*topShadowColor: CornflowerBlue Mwm*activeForeground: white Mwm*activeBackground: Blue1 Mwm*activeBottomShadowColor: black Mwm*activeTopShadowColor: LightSkyBlue Mwm*border: black Mwm*highlight:white
```

```
aixterm.foreground: green aixterm.background: black aixterm.fullcursor: true aixterm.ScrollKey: on aixterm.autoRaise: true aixterm.autoRaiseDelay: 2 aixterm.boldFont:Rom10.500 aixterm.geometry: 80x25 aixterm.iconFont: Rom8.500 aixterm.iconStartup: false aixterm.jumpScroll: true aixterm.reverseWrap: true aixterm.saveLines: 500 aixterm.scrollInput: true aixterm.scrollKey: false aixterm.title: AIX
```

## .mwmrc fi le

Most of the features that you want to customize can be set with resources in your .Xdefaults fi le. However, key bindings, mouse button bindings, and menu de fi nitions for your window manager are speci fi ed in the supplementary .mwmrc fi le, which is referenced by resources in the .Xdefaults fi le.

If you do not have a .mwmrc fi le in your home directory, you can copy it as follows:

```
cp /usr/lib/X11/system.mwmrc .mwmrc
```

Because the .mwmrc fi le overrides the system-wide effects of the system.mwmrc fi le, your speci fi cations do not interfere with the speci fi cations of other users.

The following example shows part of a typical system.mwmrc fi le:

```
# DEFAULT mwm RESOURCE DESCRIPTION FILE (system.mwmrc)
```

```
# # menu pane descriptions # # Root Menu Description
```

```
Menu RootMenu

## Exporting shell variables (export shell command)

A local shell variable is a variable known only to the shell that created it. If you start a new shell, the old shell's variables are unknown to it. If you want the new shells that you open to use the variables from an old shell, export the variables to make them global .

You can use the export command to make local variables global. To make your local shell variables global automatically, export them in your .profile fi le.

Note: Variables can be exported down to child shells but not exported up to parent shells.

See the following examples:

- To make the local shell variable PATH global, type the following:

export PATH

- To list all your exported variables, type the following:

export

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
DISPLAY=unix:0 EDITOR=vi ENV=$HOME/.env HISTFILE=/u/denise/.history HISTSIZE=500 HOME=/u/denise LANG=En_US LOGNAME=denise MAIL=/usr/mail/denise MAILCHECK=0 MAILMSG=**YOU HAVE NEW MAIL. USE THE mail COMMAND TO SEE YOUR MAILPATH=/usr/mail/denise?denise has mail !!! MAILRECORD=/u/denise/.Outmail PATH=/usr/ucb:/usr/lpp/X11/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/u/denise:/u/denise/bin:/u/bin1 PWD=/u/denise SHELL=/bin/ksh
```

## Changing the default font (chfont command)

To change the default font at system startup, use the chfont or smit command. A font palette is a fi le that the system uses to de fi ne and identify the fonts it has available.

Note: To run the chfont command, you must have root authority.

## chfont command

See the following examples on how to use the chfont command:

- To change the active font to the fi fth font in the font palette, type the following:
- To change the font to an italic, roman, and bold face of the same size, type the following:

```
chfont -a5
```

```
chfont -n /usr/lpp/fonts/It114.snf /usr/lpp/fonts/Bld14.snf /usr/lpp/fonts/Rom14.snf
```

f.resize

## smit command

The chfont command can also be run using smit .

To select the active font, type the following:

```
smit chfont To select the font palette, type the following: smit chfontpl
```

## Changing control keys (stty command)

To change the keys that your terminal uses for control keys, use the stty command.

Your changes to control keys remain in effect until you log out. To make your changes permanent, place them in your .profile fi le.

See the following examples:

- To assign Ctrl-Z as the interrupt key, type the following:

stty intr ^Z

Be sure to place a space character between intr and ^Z .

- To reset all control keys to their default values, type the following:

stty sane

- To display your current settings, type the following:

stty -a

## Changing your system prompt

You can change your system prompt.

Your shell uses the following prompt variables:

Item

Description

PS1

Prompt used as the normal system prompt

PS2

Prompt used when the shell expects more input

PS3

Prompt used when you have root authority

You can change any of your prompt characters by changing the value of its shell variable. Your prompt changes remain in effect until you log out. To make your changes permanent, place them in your .env fi le.

See the following examples:

- To display the current value of the PS1 variable, type the following:

echo "prompt is $PS1"

The system displays information similar to the following:

prompt is $

- To change your prompt to Ready&gt; , type the following:

PS1="Ready&gt; "

- To change your continuation prompt to Enter more-&gt; , type the following:

PS2="Enter more-&gt;"

- To change your root prompt to Root-&gt; , type the following:

```
PS3="Root-> "
```

## BSD systems reference

This appendix is for system administrators who are familiar with 4.3 BSD UNIX or System V operating systems. This information explains the differences and the similarities between those systems and AIX.

Topics discussed in this appendix are:

## BSD concepts

Before you start working with Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) you need to understand some of the difference between BSD and AIX.

## Introduction to AIX for BSD system managers

The following are tips to help Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) system managers get started managing AIX.

- Start by logging in as root at the graphics console.
- Perform system management from the system console until you become experienced with the system. It is easier to work from the system console than a remote terminal. Once you are experienced with the system, you can work remotely from an xterm or an ASCII terminal.
- Take advantage of the several AIX facilities for system management tasks. They include:
- System Management Interface Tool (SMIT). SMIT provides an interface between system managers and con fi guration and management commands. SMIT can help system managers perform most system administration tasks.
- The Object Data Manager (ODM). The ODM provides routines that access objects from the ODM databases. The ODM databases contain device con fi guration information
- The System Resource Controller (SRC). The SRC provides access and control of daemons and other system resources through a single interface.

## Related concepts

System Resource Controller

The System Resource Controller (SRC) provides a set of commands and subroutines to make it easier for the system manager and programmer to create and control subsystems.

## Related information

Con fi guration of a large number of devices

## Major differences between 4.3 BSD and AIX

The following is a summary of the major differences between AIX and 4.3 BSD systems.

On AIX, the network daemons are started from the /etc/rc.tcpip fi le, not the /etc/rc.local fi le. The /etc/rc.tcpip shell script is invoked from the /etc/inittab fi le, not the /etc/rc fi le.

If the System Resource Controller (SRC) is running, the TCP/IP daemons run under SRC control. If you do not want the TCP/IP daemons running under SRC control, use the smit setbootup\_option fast path to change the system to BSD-style rc con fi guration.

These network management functions available on 4.3 BSD are supported by AIX:

- Kernel-level SYSLOG logging facilities
- Access rights for UNIX domain sockets.

## Con fi guration data storage

4.3 BSD usually stores con fi guration data in ASCII fi les. Related pieces of information are kept on the same line and record processing (sorting and searching) can be done on the ASCII fi le itself.

Records can vary in length and are terminated by a line feed. 4.3 BSD provides tools to convert some potentially large ASCII fi les to a database (dbm) format. Relevant library functions search the pair of dbm fi les if they exist, but search the original ASCII fi le if the dbm fi les are not found.

Some con fi guration data for AIX is stored in ASCII fi les, but often in a stanza format. A stanza is a set of related pieces of information stored in a group of several lines. Each piece of information has a label to make the contents of the fi le more understandable.

AIX also supports dbm versions of password and user information. Furthermore, the /etc/ passwd , /etc/group , and /etc/inittab fi les are examples of fi les for AIX where the information is stored in traditional form rather than in stanza form.

Other con fi guration data for AIX are stored in fi les maintained by the Object Data Manager (ODM). System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) can manipulate and display information in ODM fi les. Alternatively, you can use the ODM commands directly to view these fi les. To query the ODM fi les, use the following commands:

- odmget
- odmshow .

The following ODM commands alter ODM fi les:

- odmadd
- odmcreate
- odmdrop
- odmchange
- odmdelete .

<!-- image -->

Attention: Altering ODM fi les incorrectly can cause the system to fail, and might prevent you from successfully restarting the system. Only use ODM commands directly on ODM fi les when task-speci fi c commands, such as those generated by SMIT, is unsuccessful.

## Con fi guration management

When a system running AIX starts up, a set of con fi guration-speci fi c commands are invoked by the Con fi guration Manager. These con fi guration-speci fi c commands are called methods . Methods identify the devices on the system and update the appropriate ODM fi les in the /etc/objrepos directory.

Device special fi les in the /dev directly are not preinstalled. Some special fi les, such as those for hard disks, are created automatically during the startup con fi guration process. Other special fi les, such as those for ASCII terminals, must be created by the system administrator by using the SMIT Devices menu. This information is retained in the ODM for later use by the system.

## Disk management

In AIX, disk drives are referred to as physical volumes . Partitions are referred to as logical volumes . As in 4.3 BSD, a single physical volume can have multiple logical volumes. However, unlike 4.3 BSD, a single logical volume in AIX can span multiple physical volumes. To do this, you must make several physical volumes into a volume group and create logical volumes on the volume group.

Commands in AIX used for fi le system and volume management include:

- crfs
- varyonvg
- varyoffvg
- lsvg
- importvg
- exportvg .

The following 4.3 BSD commands are also available:

- mkfs

- fsck
- fsdb
- mount
- umount .

Differences between these commands for 4.3 BSD and for AIX are discussed in 'File systems for BSD 4.3 system managers' on page 347.

4.3 BSD maintains a list of fi le systems in the /etc/fstab fi le. AIX maintains a stanza for each fi le system in the /etc/filesystems fi le.

## The tn3270 command

The tn3270 command is a link to the telnet command, but it uses the /etc/map3270 fi le and the current TERM environment variable value to provide 3270 keyboard mappings. Thus, the tn3270 command operates exactly like the BSD version.

If you want to change the escape sequences from the defaults used by the tn3270 , telnet , or tn commands, set the TNESC environment variable before starting these commands.

## New commands

To handle new con fi guration and disk management systems, AIX has about 150 commands that are new to 4.3 BSD administrators.

## Startup

AIX supports automatic identi fi cation and con fi guration of devices. Consequently, the startup process is very different from 4.3 BSD systems. In addition to the kernel, an image of a boot fi le system and the previous base device con fi guration information is loaded to a RAM disk. In the fi rst phase of startup, suf fi cient con fi guration information is loaded and checked to permit accessing logical volumes. The paging space device is identi fi ed to the kernel and the hard disk root fi le system is checked. At this time, the operating system changes the root fi le system from the RAM disk to the hard disk and completes the startup procedure, including con fi guring other devices.

## User authorization

4.3 BSD, and versions of AT&amp;T UNIX operating systems before SVR4, store all user authentication information, including encrypted passwords, in the /etc/passwd fi le. Traditionally, the /etc/ passwd fi le could be read by all.

On SVR4 systems, encrypted passwords are removed from the /etc/passwd fi le and stored in the /etc/shadow fi le. Only users with root authority and trusted programs (such as the /bin/login program) can read the /etc/shadow fi le.

AIX stores encrypted passwords in the /etc/security/passwd fi le. Other fi les in the /etc/ security directory are the user and limits fi les. These three fi les de fi ne the way a user is allowed to access the system (such as using the rlogin or telnet commands) and the user's resource limits (such as fi le size and address space).

## Printing

Most 4.3 BSD printing commands are supported with minor differences. One difference is that the /etc/qconfig fi le is the con fi guration fi le in AIX.

The line printing system for AIX can interoperate with the 4.3 BSD line printing system, both for submitting print jobs to 4.3 BSD systems and for printing jobs submitted from a 4.3 BSD system.

## Shells

AIX supports the Bourne shell, C shell and Korn shell. The full path name for the Bourne shell program is /bin/bsh . The /bin/sh fi le is a hard link to the /bin/ksh fi le. This fi le can be changed by the administrator.

AIX does not support setuid or setgid for shell scripts in any shell.

## Note:

1. AIX has no shell scripts that rely on the /bin/sh . However, many shell scripts from other systems rely on /bin/sh being the Bourne shell.
2. Although the Bourne shell and Korn shell are similar, the Korn shell is not a perfect superset of the Bourne shell.

Note: The fi le names named.ca , named.hosts , named.local , and named.rev are user de fi nable in the named.boot fi le. However, these are the names used for these fi les in the documentation for AIX.

## Name and address resolution

The gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr subroutines in the libc library provide support for Domain Name Service, Network Information Services (NIS, formerly called Yellow Pages), and the /etc/hosts database.

If the /etc/resolv.conf fi le exists, the name server is always checked fi rst. If the name is not resolved and NIS is running, NIS is checked. If NIS is not running, the /etc/hosts fi le is checked.

## Online documentation and man command for BSD 4.3 system managers

AIX supports the man -k , apropos , and whatis commands, but the database used by these commands must fi rst be created with the catman -w command.

The man command fi rst searches for flat text pages in the /usr/man/cat? fi les. Next, it searches nroff -formatted pages in /usr/man/man? fi les. New man pages can be added in flat text or nroff form.

## Note:

- The man command text pages are not provided with the system. The catman command creates the database from these text pages. These pages can be either flat text pages stored in the /usr/man/ cat? fi les or nroff -formatted pages stored the in /usr/man/man? fi les.
- The Text Formatting licensed program must be installed for the nroff command to be available for the man command to read nroff -formatted man pages.

For more information about these commands, see man , apropos , whatis , and catman .

## NFS and NIS (formerly Yellow Pages) for BSD 4.3 system managers

The following describes NFS and NIS for BSD 4.3 system managers.

Network File System (NFS) and Network Information Services (NIS) daemons are started from the /etc/ rc.nfs fi le. However, before the NFS and NIS daemons can be started, the portmap daemon must be started in the /etc/rc.tcpip fi le. By default, the /etc/rc.nfs fi le is not invoked by the /etc/ inittab fi le. If you add a line in the /etc/inittab fi le to invoke the /etc/rc.nfs script, it should be invoked after the /etc/rc.tcpip script.

If NIS is active, include a root entry prior to the +:: (plus sign, colon, colon) entry in the /etc/passwd fi le and a system entry prior to the +:: entry in the /etc/group fi le. This allows a system administrator to log in as root and make changes if the system is unable to communicate with the NIS server.

NFS can be con fi gured by using the SMIT fast path, smit nfs . The and SMIT menus refer to NIS (formerly Yellow Pages) as NIS. Many of the NFS and NIS commands are found in the /etc and /usr/etc directory.

Some NFS environments use an arch command to identify machine families and types of machines. For example if you are using the IBM RS/6000, specify the power identi fi er for family (CPU), and the ibm6000 identi fi er for type (machine).

## User passwords for BSD 4.3 system managers

When you use the /bin/passwd command for AIX as the root user, you are prompted for the current root user password.

An example of using the /bin/passwd command follows:

```
# passwd cslater Changing password for "cslater" Enter root's Password or cslater's Old password: cslater's New password: Re-enter cslater's new password: #
```

The 4.3 BSD version does not prompt for the current root user password. An example of the 4.3 BSD version follows:

```
# passwd cslater New password: Retype new password: #
```

## Administering BSD

There are multiple commands for BSD you can use to measure performance, print, and manage your system.

## Accounting for BSD 4.3 system managers

The accounting fi les in the /usr/lib/acct directory and the system activity reporting tools in the /usr/lib/sa directory for AIX are identical to those available with AT&amp;T System V Release 4 (SVR4) with the addition of 4.3 BSD accounting utilities.

Many of the accounting commands are in the /usr/lib/acct directory. To begin system accounting, use the /usr/lib/acct/startup command. If accounting is not started, commands such as lastcomm(1) cannot return information.

AIX provides these 4.3 BSD accounting facilities:

Item

Description

last(1)

Indicates last logins of users and terminals

lastcomm(1)

Shows in reverse order the last commands executed

Item

Description

acct(3)

Enables and disables process accounting

ac(8)

Login accounting

accton(8)

Turns system accounting on or off

sa(8)

Generally maintains system accounting fi les.

AIX also provides these System V Interface De fi nition (SVID) Issue II accounting commands and library functions:

## Backup for BSD 4.3 system managers

BSD 4.3 system managers can back up data.

The tar and cpio commands can move data between systems. The tar command for AIX is not fully compatible with the 4.3 BSD tar command. The tar command for AIX requires the -B flag (blocking input) if it is reading from a pipe. The AT&amp;T cpio command is compatible with this version.

AIX can read and write in dump and restore command format. For example, the backup command for AIX with the syntax:

```
backup -0uf Device Filesystemname
```

is the same as the 4.3 BSD dump command with the syntax:

dump 0uf Device Filesystemname

Similarly, the restore command for AIX with the syntax:

```
restore -mivf Device
```

is the same as the 4.3 BSD restore command with the syntax:

restore ivf Device

AIX also has the 4.3 BSD rdump and rrestore commands. The only difference in the two versions is that for AIX, each argument must be preceded by a -(dash). For example, the following command:

```
rdump -0 -f orca:/dev/rmt0 /dev/hd2
```

is equivalent to the 4.3 BSD command:

rdump 0f orca:/dev/rmt0 /dev/hd2

The backup command for AIX with the following syntax:

backup -0f /dev/rmt0 /dev/hd2

is equivalent to the 4.3 BSD dump command with this syntax:

```
dump 0f /dev/rmt0 /dev/hd2
```

## Non-IBM SCSI tape support

AIX does not directly support non-IBM SCSI tape drives. However, you can add your own header and interface that use the IBM SCSI driver.

## Related concepts

## System backup

Once your system is in use, your next consideration should be to back up the fi le systems, directories, and fi les. If you back up your fi le systems, you can restore fi les or fi le systems in the event of a hard disk crash. There are different methods for backing up information.

## Startup for BSD 4.3 system managers

The following discusses AIX system startup for BSD 4.3 system managers.

On 4.3 BSD systems, the init program is the last step in the startup procedure. The main role of the init program is to create processes for each available terminal port. The available terminal ports are found by reading the /etc/ttys fi le.

On System V, the init program is started at system initialization. The init process starts processes according to entries in the /etc/inittab fi le.

AIX follows the System V initialization procedure. You can edit the /etc/inittab fi le by directly editing the fi le, using the telinit command, or by using the following commands:

| Item      | Description                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| chitab(1) | Changes records in the /etc/inittab fi le |
| lsitab(1) | Lists records in the /etc/inittab fi le   |
| mkitab(1) | Makes records in the /etc/inittab fi le   |
| rmitab(1) | Removes records in the /etc/inittab fi le |

Changes made to the /etc/inittab fi le take effect the next time the system is rebooted, or when the telinit q command is run.

## Finding and examining fi les for BSD 4.3 system managers

The following is a list of the BSD fi le commands that AIX supports.

AIX supports the following 4.3 BSD fi le commands:

- which
- whereis
- what
- file .

AIX does not support the 4.3 BSD fast fi nd syntax of the find command. At this time, there is no replacement function. The following ffind shell script can be used to simulate the functionality:

```
#!/bin/bsh PATH=/bin for dir in /bin /etc /lib /usr do find $dir -print | egrep $1 done
```

The syntax for the ffind script is:

ffind Filename

## Paging space for BSD 4.3 system managers

The following commands assist in managing paging space (also known as swap space).

Item

Description

chps(1)

Changes attributes of a paging space

lsps(1)

List attributes of a paging space

mkps(1)

Add an additional paging space to the system

rmps(1)

Removes a paging space from the system

swapoff(1)

Deactivates one or more paging spaces

swapon(1)

Speci fi es additional devices for paging and swapping

If a large paging space is required, place one paging logical volume for each hard disk. This allows scheduling of paging across multiple disk drives.

## Changing the default startup to permit 4.3 BSD ASCII con fi guration

You can administer network interfaces for AIX through the SMIT and ODM fi les, or through 4.3 BSD ASCII con fi guration fi les.

To administer network interfaces through 4.3 BSD ASCII con fi guration fi les, uncomment the commands in the /etc/rc.net fi le below the heading:

# Part II -Traditional Configuration

Then if you want flat fi le con fi guration and SRC support, edit the /etc/rc.net fi le and uncomment the hostname , ifconfig , and route commands with the appropriate parameters.

If you want flat fi le con fi guration without SRC support, use the smit setbootup\_option fast path to change the system to BSD-style rc con fi guration. This option con fi gures the system to use the /etc/ rc.bsdnet fi le at startup. You also have to edit the /etc/rc.bsdnet fi le and uncomment the hostname , ifconfig , and route commands with the appropriate parameters.

## Additional options for ifcon fi g and netstat commands

The following is a list of additional options for the ifconfig and netstat commands.

The ifconfig command for AIX has the following additional options:

## mtu

The mtu variable speci fi es the maximum transmission unit (MTU) used on the local network (and local subnets) and the MTU used for remote networks. To maximize compatibility with Ethernet and other networks, set both the Token-Ring and Ethernet default mtu value to 1500.

## allcast

The allcast flag sets the Token-Ring broadcast strategy. Setting the allcast flag optimizes connectivity through Token-Ring bridges. Clearing the allcast flag (by specifying -allcast ) minimizes excess traf fi c on the ring.

The netstat command for AIX has the -v flag. The netstat -v command prints driver statistics such as transmit byte count, transmit error count, receive byte count, and receive error count. For more information about the ifconfig and netstat commands, see ifconfig and netstat .

## Additional network management commands

The following additional commands are supported on AIX.

Item

## Description

securetcpip

The securetcpip shell script enables controlled access mode, which provides enhanced network security. It disallows the running of several unsecured TCP/IP programs, such as the tftp , rcp , rlogin , and rsh programs. It also restricts the use of the .netrc fi le.

gated

The gated command provides MIB support for SNMP.

## Item

no iptrace

ipreport

## Description

The no command sets network options that include:

## dogticks

Sets timer granularity for ifwatchdog routines

## subnetsarelocal

Determines if packet address is on the local network

## ipsendredirects

Speci fi es whether the kernel should send redirect signals

## ipforwarding

Speci fi es whether the kernel should forward packets

## tcp\_ttl

Speci fi es the time-to-live for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets

## udp\_ttl

Speci fi es the time-to-live for User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets

## maxttl

Speci fi es the time-to-live for Routing Information Protocol (RIP) packets

## ipfragttl

Speci fi es the time-to-live for Internet Protocol (IP) fragments

## lowclust

Speci fi es a low water mark for cluster mbuf pool

## lowmbuf

Speci fi es a low water mark for the mbuf pool

## thewall

Speci fi es the maximum amount of memory that is allocated to the mbuf and cluster mbuf pool

## arpt\_killc

Speci fi es the time in minutes before an inactive complete Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entry is deleted

The iptrace command provides interface-level packet tracing for Internet protocols.

The ipreport command formats the trace into human-readable form. An example of using this command is the following:

```
iptrace -i en0 /tmp/iptrace.log }'`
```

# kill iptrace daemon kill `ps ax | grep iptrace | awk '{ print $1 ipreport /tmp/iptrace.log | more

## Importing a BSD 4.3 password fi le

You can import a BSD 4.3 password fi le into AIX.

To import a BSD 4.3 password fi le, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the BSD 4.3 password fi le to the /etc/passwd fi le and enter:
2. Update the /etc/security/limits fi le with a null stanza for any new users.

```
pwdck -y ALL
```

The usrck command does this, but using the usrck command can cause problems unless the /etc/ group fi le is imported with the /etc/passwd fi le. For more information about the usrck command, see usrck .

<!-- image -->

Attention: If the /etc/security/limits fi le is modi fi ed, the stack must not exceed 65,536 bytes. If it does, running the usrck command can cause problems. Change the stack size to 65,536 and run usrck command again.

3. Run the grpck and usrck commands to verify group and user attributes.

## Editing the password fi le for BSD 4.3 system managers

The following explains how to change entries in the password fi le and how to administer passwords on AIX in a BSD 4.3 manner.

In AIX, the lsuser , mkuser , chuser , and rmuser commands are provided for managing passwords. All of these commands can be used by running SMIT. However, all of these commands deal with only one user at a time.

For more information about these commands, see lsuser , mkuser , chuser , and rmuser .

Note: Using an editor to change several user name entries at one time requires editing of several fi les simultaneously, because passwords are stored in the /etc/security/passwd fi le, authorization information is stored in the /etc/security/user fi le, and the remaining user data is stored in the /etc/passwd fi le.

AIX does not support the vipw command but does support the mkpasswd command. However, you can still administer passwords in AIX in a BSD 4.3 manner. Use the following procedure:

1. Put a BSD 4.3 password fi le in the /etc/shadow fi le.
2. Change the permissions to the fi le by entering:
3. Place the following vipw shell script in the /etc directory:

```
chmod 000 /etc/shadow
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------#!/bin/bsh # # vipw. Uses pwdck for now. May use usrck someday # PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/ucb # Add to this if your editor is # some place else if [ -f /etc/ptmp ] ; then echo "/etc/ptmp exists. Is someone else using vipw?" exit 1 fi if [ ! -f /`which "$EDITOR" | awk '{ print $1 }'` ] ; then EDITOR=vi fi cp /etc/shadow /etc/ptmp if (cmp /etc/shadow /etc/ptmp) ; then $EDITOR /etc/ptmp else echo cannot copy shadow to ptmp exit 1 fi if (egrep "^root:" /etc/ptmp >/dev/null) ; then cp /etc/ptmp /etc/shadow ; cp /etc/ptmp /etc/passwd chmod 000 /etc/passwd /etc/shadow pwdck -y ALL 2>1 >/dev/null # return code 114 may change rc=$? if [ $rc -eq 114 ]; then chmod 644 /etc/passwd rm -f /etc/passwd.dir /etc/passwd.pag mkpasswd /etc/passwd # update /etc/security/limits, or ftp # will fail else pwdck -y ALL fi else echo bad entry for root in ptmp fi rm /etc/ptmp -----------------------------------------------------------
```

4. If you use the vipw shell script or the mkpasswd command, be aware that SMIT, and the mkuser , chuser , and rmuser commands do not use the mkpasswd command. You must run:

```
mkpasswd /etc/passwd
```

Attention: Initialization of the IFS variable and the trap statements guard against some of the common methods used to exploit security holes inherent in the setuid feature. However, the vipw and passwd shell scripts are intended for relatively open environments where compatibility is an important consideration. If you want a more secure environment, use only the standard commands for AIX.

5. Put the following passwd shell script in the /usr/ucb directory:
6. Change the permissions to the passwd script by entering:
7. Ensure that each user PATH environmental variable speci fi es that the /usr/ucb directory be searched before the /bin directory.

## Performance measurement and tuning for BSD 4.3 system managers

Thie following discusses AIX device attributes and performance measurement and tuning.

All devices on AIX have attributes associated with them. To view device attributes, enter:

```
lsattr -E -l devicename
```

Any attributes with the value True can be modi fi ed with the command:

```
chdev -l devicename -a attr=value
```

<!-- image -->

Attention: Changing device parameters incorrectly can damage your system.

By default, the maximum number of processes per user is 40. The default value might be too low for users who have many windows open simultaneously. The following command can be used to change the value systemwide:

```
hdev -l sys0 -a maxuproc=100 This example changes the maximum number to 100. The new value is set once the system has restarted. To view the current setting of this and other system attributes, type:
```

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The maxmbuf attribute is not currently supported by the mbuf services.

AIX supports the vmstat and iostat commands, but not the systat command or load averages. For more information about these commands, see vmstat and iostat .

## Printers for BSD 4.3 system managers

The AIX operating system supports two printing subsystems: 4.3 BSD and System V.

The System V style of printing subsystem uses System V Release 4 commands, queues, and fi les and is administered the same way. The following paragraphs describe what you need to know to manage the 4.3 BSD style of printing subsystem. You control which subsystem is made active through SMIT. Only one subsystem can be active at a time.

Printing is managed by programs and con fi gurations in the /usr/lpd directory. The design, con fi guration, queueing mechanism, and daemon processes of the 4.3 BSD and printer subsystems for AIX are different. However, they both use the lpd protocol for remote printing. Both systems use /etc/hosts.lpd , if it exists, or /etc/host.equiv otherwise. The printer subsystem for AIX offers a gateway to 4.3 BSD printer subsystems, so systems using AIX can submit print jobs to 4.3 BSD systems and accept print jobs submitted by 4.3 BSD systems.

The /etc/printcap fi le of 4.3 BSD does not exist in AIX. This fi le is a combination of spooler con fi guration and printer capability database. Users need to understand the format and keywords of the printcap fi le to set up a printer correctly.

The /etc/qconfig fi le of AIX contains only the spooler con fi guration information. The printer capability is de fi ned in the ODM prede fi ned or customized database. You can use the mkvirprt (make virtual printer) command to de fi ne to the system the capabilities of a particular printer.

To make printer lp0 available to print on the remote host viking, put the following in a 4.3 BSD system /etc/printcap fi le:

```
lp0|Print on remote printer attached to
```

```
viking:Z :lp=:rm=viking:rp=lp:st=/usr/spool/lp0d
```

To do the same in AIX, put the following in the /etc/qconfig fi le:

```
lp0: device = dlp0 host = viking rq = lp dlp0: backend = /usr/lib/lpd/rembak
```

AIX supports the following printer commands and library functions:

Major differences between 4.3 BSD and AIX

The following is a summary of the major differences between AIX and 4.3 BSD systems.

## Cron for BSD 4.3 system managers

The cron daemon for this operating system is similar to the System V Release 2 cron daemon.

An entry in the /etc/inittab fi le starts the cron daemon.

The following discusses devices for BSD 4.3 system managers.

A device on a 4.3 BSD system is accessible to an application only when:

- The device is physically installed and functioning.
- The driver for the device is in the kernel.
- The device special fi les for the device exist in the /dev directory.

A device on AIX is accessible to an application only when:

- The device is physically installed and functioning.
- The driver for the device is in the kernel or in a loaded kernel extension.
- The device special fi les for the device exist in the /dev directory.
- The object database in the /etc/objrepos directory contains entries for the device that match the physical con fi guration.

The device speci fi c programs called methods , found in the /etc/methods directory, maintain the object database. The methods are invoked by the Con fi guration Manager (accessed through the cfgmgr command) and other commands.

If a device can no longer be accessed by an application program, it can mean that the hardware is faulty or it can mean that the con fi guration database in the /etc/objrepos directory is damaged.

The cfgmgr command processes the con fi guration database in the /etc/objrepos directory and is processed at startup time by the cfgmgr command (the Con fi guration Manager).

The pseudocode below shows the Con fi guration Manager logic:

```
/* Main */ While there are rules in the Config_Rules database { Get the next rule and execute it Capture stdout from the last execution Parse_Output(stdout) } /* Parse Output Routine */ /* stdout will contain a list of devices found */ Parse_OutPut(stdout) { While there are devices left in the list { Lookup the device in the database if (!defined) Get define method from database and execute if (! configured) { Get config method from database and execute Parse_Output(stdout) } } }
```

## File systems for BSD 4.3 system managers

Similar commands are used to mount and unmount fi le systems.

AIX uses the /etc/filesystem fi le to list fi le system device information, and has similar commands for mounting and unmounting fi le systems.

## /etc/ fi lesystems fi le and /etc/fstab fi le

4.3 BSD systems store lists of block devices and mount points in the /etc/fstab fi le. SVR4 systems store block devices and mount point information in /etc/vfstab fi le. AIX stores block device and mount points information in /etc/filesystems fi le.

The crfs , chfs , and rmfs commands update the /etc/filesystems fi le.

4.3 BSD system administrators might be interested in the check variable in the /etc/filesystems fi le. The check variable can be set to the value True , False , or to a number. For example, you can specify check=2 in the /etc/filesystems fi le. The number speci fi es the pass of the fsck command that will check this fi le system. The check parameter corresponds to the fi fth fi eld in an /etc/fstab fi le record.

There is no dump frequency parameter in the /etc/filesystems fi le.

## File system support on AIX

AIX supports various fi le systems.

AIX supports disk quotas.

AIX does not allow mounting of diskettes as fi le systems.

The syntax of the mount and umount commands for AIX differs from 4.3 BSD and from SVR4 versions of these commands. The commands to mount and unmount all fi le systems at once are shown for all three systems in the following table:

## mount and unmount Commands

| Function                  | Syntax for this operating system   | 4.3 BSD Syntax   | SVR4 Syntax   |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| mount all fi le systems   | mount all                          | mount -a         | mountall      |
| unmount all fi le systems | umount all                         | umount -a        | umountall     |

See ../devicemanagement/ fi le\_sys.html# fi le\_sys for more information.

## Terminals for BSD 4.3 system managers

The following discusses terminals for BSD 4.3 system managers.

Traditionally, 4.3 BSD system managers enable or disable terminal ports by modifying the /etc/ttys fi le and sending a HUP signal to the init program.

AIX stores terminal port information in the ODM and starts terminals when the init program reads the /etc/inittab fi le. In AIX, use the SMIT interface to con fi gure terminal ports.

There is no fi xed mapping between the port and the device special fi le name in the /dev directory. Consequently, it is confusing to system managers who are new to AIX which port is to be con fi gured. When using SMIT, the fi rst planar serial port (physically labeled s1 ) is referred to as location 00-00-S1 , adapter sa0 , and port s1 in the SMIT menus. The second planar serial port (physically labeled s2 ) is referred to as location 00-00-S2 , adapter sa1 , and port s2 .

Use the penable and pdisable commands to enable and disable a port.

## termcap and terminfo

Like System V, this operating system uses terminfo entries in /usr/lib/terminfo/?/* fi les.

Users with 4.3 BSD Systems might fi nd the following commands helpful:

## captoinfo(1)

Converts a termcap fi le to a terminfo fi le

## tic(1)

Translates the terminfo fi les from source to compiled format.

This operating system includes source for many terminfo entries. Some of these might need to be compiled with the tic command. The termcap fi le is provided in /lib/libtermcap/termcap.src fi le.

## Input and output redirection

The AIX operating system allows you to manipulate the input and output (I/O) of data to and from your system by using speci fi c I/O commands and symbols.

You can control input by specifying the location from which to gather data. For example, you can specify to read input while data is entered on the keyboard (standard input) or to read input from a fi le. You can control output by specifying where to display or store data. You can specify to write output data to the screen (standard output) or to write it to a fi le.

Because AIX is a multitasking operating system, it is designed to handle processes in combination with each other.

## Related concepts

Commands for displaying fi le contents (pg, more, page, and cat commands)

The pg , more , and page commands allow you to view the contents of a fi le and control the speed at which your fi les are displayed.

Input and output redirection in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

Before the Korn shell executes a command, it scans the command line for redirection characters. These special notations direct the shell to redirect input and output.

## Standard input, standard output, and standard error fi les

When a command begins running, it usually expects that the following fi les are already open: standard input, standard output, and standard error (sometimes called error output or diagnostic output).

A number, called a fi le descriptor, is associated with each of these fi les, as follows:

Item

Description

| File descriptor 0   | Standard input                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| File descriptor 1   | Standard output                    |
| File descriptor 2   | Standard error (diagnostic) output |

A child process normally inherits these fi les from its parent. All three fi les are initially assigned to the workstation (0 to the keyboard, 1 and 2 to the display). The shell permits them to be redirected elsewhere before control is passed to a command.

When you enter a command, if no fi le name is given, your keyboard is the standard input , sometimes denoted as stdin . When a command fi nishes, the results are displayed on your screen.

Your screen is the standard output , sometimes denoted as stdout . By default, commands take input from the standard input and send the results to standard output.

Error messages are directed to standard error, sometimes denoted as stderr . By default, this is your screen.

These default actions of input and output can be varied. You can use a fi le as input and write results of a command to a fi le. This is called input/output redirection .

The output from a command, which normally goes to the display device, can be redirected to a fi le instead. This is known as output redirection . This is useful when you have a lot of output that is dif fi cult to read on the screen or when you want to put fi les together to create a larger fi le.

Though not used as much as output redirection, the input for a command, which normally comes from the keyboard, can also be redirected from a fi le. This is known as input redirection . Redirection of input lets you prepare a fi le in advance and then have the command read the fi le.

## Standard output redirection

When the notation &gt; filename is added to the end of a command, the output of the command is written to the speci fi ed fi le name. The &gt; symbol is known as the output redirection operator .

Any command that outputs its results to the screen can have its output redirected to a fi le.

## Redirecting output to a fi le

The output of a process can be redirected to a fi le by typing the command followed by the output redirection operator and fi le name.

For example, to redirect the results of the who command to a fi le named users , type the following:

```
who > users
```

Note: If the users fi le already exists, it is deleted and replaced, unless the noclobber option of the set built-in ksh (Korn shell) or csh (C shell) command is speci fi ed.

To see the contents of the users fi le, type the following:

cat users

A list similar to the following is displayed:

```
denise lft/0 May 13 08:05 marta pts/1 May 13 08:10 endrica pts/2 May 13 09:33
```

## Redirecting output to append to a fi le

When the notation &gt;&gt; fi lename is added to the end of a command, the output of the command is appended to the speci fi ed fi le name, rather than writing over any existing data. The &gt;&gt; symbol is known as the append redirection operator .

For example, to append file2 to file1 , type the following:

```
cat file2 >> file1
```

Note: If the file1 fi le does not exist, it is created, unless the noclobber option of the set built-in ksh (Korn shell) or csh (C shell) command is speci fi ed.

## Creating a text fi le with redirection from the keyboard

Used alone, the cat command uses whatever you type at the keyboard as input. You can redirect this input to a fi le.

Press Ctrl-D on a new line to signal the end of the text.

At the system prompt, type the following:

```
cat > filename This is a test. ^D
```

## Text fi le concatenation

You can combine multiple fi les into one fi le. Combining various fi les into one fi le is known as concatenation .

The following example creates file4 , which consists of file1 , file2 , and file3 , appended in the order below.

See the following examples:

- At the system prompt, type the following:
- The following example shows a common error when concatenating fi les:

```
cat file1 file2 file3 > file4
```

```
cat file1 file2 file3 > file1
```

<!-- image -->

Attention: In this example, you might expect the cat command to append the contents of file1 , file2 , and file3 into file1 . The cat command creates the output fi le fi rst, so it actually erases the contents of file1 and then appends file2 and file3 to it.

## Standard input redirection

When the notation &lt; filename is added to the end of a command, the input of the command is read from the speci fi ed fi le name. The &lt; symbol is known as the input redirection operator .

Note: Only commands that normally take their input from the keyboard can have their input redirected.

For example, to send the fi le letter1 as a message to user denise with the mail command, type the following:

```
mail denise < letter1
```

## Discarding output with the /dev/null fi le

The /dev/null fi le is a special fi le. This fi le has a unique property: it is always empty. Any data sent to /dev/null is discarded. This is a useful feature when you run a program or command that generates output that you want to ignore.

For example, you have a program named myprog that accepts input from the screen and generates messages while it is running that you would rather not see on your screen. To read input from the fi le myscript and discard the standard output messages, type the following:

```
myprog < myscript >/dev/null
```

In this example, myprog uses the fi le myscript as input, and all standard output is discarded.

## Standard error and other output redirection

In addition to the standard input and standard output, commands often produce other types of output, such as error or status messages known as diagnostic output. Like standard output, standard error output is written to the screen unless it is redirected.

To redirect standard error or other output, use a fi le descriptor. A fi le descriptor is a number associated with each of the I/O fi les that a command ordinarily uses. File descriptors can also be speci fi ed to redirect standard input and standard output. The following numbers are associated with standard input, output, and error:

## Ite Description

m

- 0 Standard input (keyboard)
- 1 Standard output (display)
- 2 Standard error (display)

To redirect standard error output, type the fi le descriptor number 2 in front of the output or append redirection symbols ( &gt; or &gt; &gt; ) and a fi le name after the symbol. For example, the following command takes the standard error output from the cc command where it is used to compile the testfile.c fi le and appends it to the end of the ERRORS fi le:

```
cc testfile.c 2>> ERRORS
```

Other types of output can also be redirected using the fi le descriptors from 0 through 9 . For example, if the cmd command writes output to fi le descriptor 9 , you can redirect that output to the savedata fi le with the following command:

```
cmd 9> savedata
```

If a command writes to more than one output, you can independently redirect each one. Suppose that a command directs its standard output to fi le descriptor 1, directs its standard error output to fi le descriptor 2, and builds a data fi le on fi le descriptor 9. The following command line redirects each of these outputs to a different fi le:

```
command > standard 2> error 9> data
```

## Redirecting output to inline input (here) documents

You can redirect output to inline input (here) documents.

If a command is in the following form:

```
command << eofstring
```

and eofstring is any string that does not contain pattern-matching characters, then the shell takes the subsequent lines as the standard input of command until the shell reads a line consisting of only eofstring (possibly preceded by one or more tab characters). The lines between the fi rst eofstring and the second are frequently referred to as an inline input document , or a here document . If a hyphen (-) immediately follows the &lt;&lt; redirection characters, the shell strips leading tab characters from each line of the here document before it passes the line to command .

The shell creates a temporary fi le containing the here document and performs variable and command substitution on the contents before passing the fi le to the command. It performs pattern matching on fi le names that are part of command lines in command substitutions. To prohibit all substitutions, quote any character of the eofstring :

```
command << \eofstring
```

The here document is especially useful for a small amount of input data that is more conveniently placed in the shell procedure rather than kept in a separate fi le (such as editor scripts). For example, you could type the following:

```
cat <<-xyz removed.
```

```
This message will be shown on the display with leading tabs xyz
```

## Related concepts

Input and output redirection in the Korn shell or POSIX shell

Before the Korn shell executes a command, it scans the command line for redirection characters. These special notations direct the shell to redirect input and output.

## Redirecting output using pipes and fi lters

You can connect two or more commands so that the standard output of one command is used as the standard input of another command. A set of commands connected this way is known as a pipeline .

The connection that joins the commands is known as a pipe . Pipes are useful because they let you tie many single-purpose commands into one powerful command. You can direct the output from one command to become the input for another command using a pipeline. The commands are connected by a pipe ( | ) symbol.

When a command takes its input from another command, modi fi es it, and sends its results to standard output, it is known as a fi lter . Filters can be used alone, but they are especially useful in pipelines. The most common fi lters are as follows:

- sort
- more
- pg

See the following examples:

- The ls command writes the contents of the current directory to the screen in one scrolling data stream. When more than one screen of information is presented, some data is lost from view. To control the output so the contents display screen by screen, you can use a pipeline to direct the output of the ls command to the pg command, which controls the format of output to the screen. For example, type the following:

```
ls | pg
```

In this example, the output of the ls command becomes the input for the pg command. Press Enter to continue to the next screen.

Pipelines operate in one direction only (left to right). Each command in a pipeline runs as a separate process, and all processes can run at the same time. A process pauses when it has no input to read or when the pipe to the next process is full.

- Another example of using pipes is with the grep command. The grep command searches a fi le for lines that contain strings of a certain pattern. To display all your fi les created or modi fi ed in July, type the following:

```
ls -l | grep Jul
```

In this example, the output of the ls command becomes the input for the grep command.

## Displaying program output and copying to a fi le (tee command)

The tee command, used with a pipe, reads standard input, then writes the output of a program to standard output and simultaneously copies it into the speci fi ed fi le or fi les. Use the tee command to view your output immediately and at the same time, store it for future use.

For example, type the following:

```
ps -ef | tee program.ps
```

This displays the standard output of the ps -ef command on the display device, and at the same time, saves a copy of it in the program.ps fi le. If the program.ps fi le already exists, it is deleted and replaced unless the noclobber option of the set built-in command is speci fi ed.

For example, to view and save the output from a command to an existing fi le:

```
ls -l | tee -a program.ls
```

This displays the standard output of ls -l at the display device and at the same time appends a copy of it to the end of the program.ls fi le.

The system displays information similar to the following, and the program.ls fi le contains the same information:

```
-rw-rw-rw1 jones staff 2301 Sep 19 08:53 161414 -rw-rw-rw1 jones staff 6317 Aug 31 13:17 def.rpt -rw-rw-rw1 jones staff 5550 Sep 10 14:13 try.doc
```

## Clearing your screen (clear command)

Use the clear command to empty the screen of messages and keyboard input.

At the prompt, type the following:

clear

The system clears the screen and displays the prompt.

## Sending a message to standard output

Use the echo command to display messages on the screen.

For example, to write a message to standard output, at the prompt, type the following:

```
echo Please insert diskette . . .
```

The following message is displayed:

```
Please insert diskette . . .
```

For example, to use the echo command with pattern-matching characters, at the prompt, type the following:

```
echo The back-up files are: *.bak
```

The system displays the message The back-up files are: followed by the fi le names in the current directory ending with .bak .

## Appending a single line of text to a fi le (echo command)

Use the echo command, used with the append redirection operator, to add a single line of text to a fi le.

For example, at the prompt, type the following:

```
echo Remember to back up mail files by end of week.>>notes
```

This adds the message Remember to back up mail files by end of week. to the end of the fi le notes .

## Copying your screen to a fi le (capture and script commands)

Use the capture command, which emulates a VT100 terminal, to copy everything printed on your terminal to a fi le that you specify. Use the script command to copy everything printed on your terminal to a fi le that you specify, without emulating a VT100 terminal.

Both commands are useful for printing records of terminal dialogs.

For example, to capture the screen of a terminal while emulating a VT100, at the prompt, type the following:

```
capture screen.01
```

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
Capture command is started. The file is screen.01. Use ^P to dump screen to file screen.01. You are now emulating a vt100 terminal. Press Any Key to continue.
```

After entering data and dumping the screen contents, stop the capture command by pressing Ctrl-D or typing exit and pressing Enter. The system displays information similar to the following:

```
Capture command is complete. The file is screen.01. You are NO LONGER emulating a vt100 terminal.
```

Use the cat command to display the contents of your fi le.

For example, to capture the screen of a terminal, at the prompt, type the following:

script

The system displays information similar to the following:

```
Script command is started. The file is typescript.
```

Everything displayed on the screen is now copied to the typescript fi le.

To stop the script command, press Ctrl-D or type exit and press Enter. The system displays information similar to the following:

```
Script command is complete. The file is typescript.
```

Use the cat command to display the contents of your fi le.

## Command to display text in large letters on your screen (banner command)

The banner command displays ASCII characters to your screen in large letters.

Each line in the output can be up to 10 digits (or uppercase or lowercase characters) in length.

For example, at the prompt, type the following:

```
banner GOODBYE! The system displays GOODBYE! in large letters on your screen.
```

## Command summary for input and output redirection

The following are commands for input and output redirection.

| Item    | Description                                                          |

## AIX kernel recovery

Beginning with AIX 6.1, the kernel can optionally recover from errors in selected routines, avoiding an unplanned system outage.

Kernel recovery is disabled by default. If kernel recovery is enabled, the system might pause for a short time during a kernel recovery action. This time is generally less than two seconds. The following actions occur immediately after a kernel recovery action:

- The system console displays the following message:
- AIX adds an entry into the error log. You can send the error log data to IBM for service, similar to sending data from a full system termination. The following is a sample recovery error log entry:

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------A kernel error recovery action has occurred. A recovery log has been logged in the system error log. -------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

```

```

- AIX generates a live dump. The data from a live dump is located by default in the /var/adm/ras/ livedump directory and the fi le is named RECOV\_ timestamp \_ sequence , where timestamp speci fi es the time of the kernel recovery occurrence, and sequence speci fi es the number of times that kernel recovery has been invoked. You can send live dump data to IBM for service, similar to sending data from a full system termination. For more information about live dumps, see live dumps in Kernel Extensions and Device Support Programming Concepts .

Attention : Some functions might be lost after a kernel recovery, but the operating system remains in a stable state. If necessary, shut down and restart your system to restore the lost functions.

## Memory and processor considerations

AIX maintains data on the status of kernel recovery during mainline kernel operations. When kernel recovery is enabled, additional processor instructions are required to maintain the data and additional memory is required to save the data. The impact to processor usage is minimal. Additional memory consumption can be determined by the following equation, where maxthread is the maximum number of threads running on the system and procnum is the number of processors:

```
memory required = 4 KB x maxthread + 128 KB x procnum
```

As show in the following example, a system with 16 processors and a maximum of 1000 threads consumes an additional 6304 KB:

```
4 x 1000 + 128 x 16 = 6304 KB
```

## Enabling and disabling kernel recovery

You can enable or disable kernel recovery from the SMIT path interface.

To enable, or disable kernel recovery, use the following SMIT path:

## Problem Determination &gt; Kernel Recovery &gt; Change Kernel Recovery State &gt; Change Next Boot Kernel Recovery State

You can also display the current kernel recovery state by using the following SMIT path:

## AIX Event Infrastructure for AIX and AIX clusters-AHAFS

AIX Event Infrastructure for AIX and AIX clusters comprise an event monitoring framework for monitoring prede fi ned and user-de fi ned events.

## Introduction to the AIX Event Infrastructure

The AIX Event Infrastructure is an event monitoring framework for monitoring prede fi ned and userde fi ned events.

In the AIX Event Infrastructure, an event is de fi ned as any change of a state or a value that can be detected by the kernel or a kernel extension at the time the change occurs. The events that can be monitored are represented as fi les in a pseudo fi le system. Some advantages of the AIX Event infrastructure are:

- There is no need for constant polling. Users monitoring the events are noti fi ed when those events occur.
- Detailed information about an event (such as stack trace and user and process information) is provided to the user monitoring the event.
- Existing fi le system interfaces are used so that there is no need for a new application programming interface (API).

- Control is handed to the AIX Event Infrastructure at the exact time the event occurs.

## AIX Event Infrastructure components

The AIX Event Infrastructure is made up of the following four components:

- The kernel extension implementing the pseudo fi le system.
- The event consumers that consume the events.
- The event producers that produce events.
- The kernel component that serve as an interface between the kernel extension and the event producers.

<!-- image -->

## AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension

The AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension implements the pseudo fi le system.

All events are represented as fi les in this fi le system. There are four fi le object types:

- .list fi les : There is only one .list fi le in the pseudo fi le system evProds.list . This is a special fi le which when read, will return the names of all currently de fi ned event producers.
- .monFactory directories : Monitor factories are a special type of directory. These are directory representations of the event producers. Monitor factory directories and their parent subdirectories are automatically created for the user.
- subdirectories : Sub directories are used both for ease of management and to represent full path names for monitor fi les (see .mon fi les ).

- .mon fi les : The monitor fi les represent the events that can be monitored. The full pathname of a monitor fi le from its parent monitor factory, minus the .mon extension is the full representation of the event being monitored. For example, the fi le /aha/fs/modFile.monFactory/etc/password.mon is used to monitor the modi fi cations to the /etc/passwd fi le. Monitor fi les can only exist underneath a monitor factory.

No other regular fi les can be created in this pseudo fi le system. Since the AIX Event Infrastructure fi le system is an in-memory fi le system, there is a maximum of 32 KB of inodes that may exist. The number of inodes used will be displayed in the df command output.

An example of the layout of an AIX Event Infrastructure fi le system is shown below:

<!-- image -->

## Note:

The evProds.list fi le exists directly under the root of the fi le system, and contains the list of event producers that are de fi ned and usable under this operating system instance.

Using the LFS interface, the AIX Event Infrastructure will translate text input written to monitor fi les into speci fi cations on how the user wants to be noti fi ed of event occurrences. Once a user has issued a select() or a blocking read() call to signify the beginning of their monitoring, the AIX Event Infrastructure will notify the corresponding event producer to start monitoring the speci fi ed event.

When an event occurrence is detected, the AIX Event Infrastructure will notify all waiting consumers whose monitoring criteria have been met.

## Event consumers

Event consumers are user space processes that are waiting on events to occur.

Consumers set up event monitoring by writing information to a monitor fi le specifying how and when they should be noti fi ed. Consumers may wait for event noti fi cation in a select() call or a blocking read() call.

The AIX Event Infrastructure is not thread safe. Processes should not use multiple threads to monitor the same event.

## Event producers

Event producers are sections of code within the kernel or a kernel extension that can detect an event.

When a monitored event occurs, the event producer noti fi es the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension and sends any associated information about the event to pass on to the consumer.

Currently, there are two main classes of event producers:

- Those that monitor for a state change
- Those that monitor for a value exceeding user-speci fi ed thresholds

## ahafs\_evprods kernel service

The ahafs\_evprods kernel service facilitates communication between the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension and event producers.

To facilitate communication between the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension and event producers, the ahafs\_evprods kernel service is exported. Inside the kernel, a list of registered event producers is used to look up event producers and to pass information between appropriate event producers and the kernel extension.

## Setting up the AIX Event Infrastructure

Steps required for setting up the AIX Event Infrastructure.

The only steps necessary to set up the AIX Event Infrastructure are:

1. Install the bos.ahafs fi leset.
2. Create the directory for the desired mount point.
3. Run the following command:

```
mount -v ahafs <mount point> <mount point>
```

## Example

```
mkdir /aha mount -v ahafs /aha /aha
```

Mounting an AIX Event Infrastructure fi le system will automatically load the kernel extension and create all monitor factories. Only one instance of an AIX Event Infrastructure fi le system may be mounted at a time. An AIX Event Infrastructure fi le system may be mounted on any regular directory, but it is suggested that users use /aha .

## High-level view of how the AIX Event Infrastructure works

A consumer may monitor multiple events, and multiple consumers may monitor the same event. Each consumer may monitor value-based events with a different threshold value. To handle this, the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension keeps a list of each consumer's information including:

- Speci fi ed wait type ( WAIT\_IN\_READ or WAIT\_IN\_SELECT )
- Level of information requested
- Threshold (s) for which to monitor (if monitoring a threshold value event)
- A buffer used to hold information about event occurrences.

Event information is stored per-process so that different processes monitoring the same event do not alter the event data. When a consumer process reads from a monitor fi le, it will only read its own copy of the event data.

## Typical flow of monitoring an event

The steps in monitoring an event is described in this topic.

1. A process attempts to open or create a monitor fi le.
2. AIX Event Infrastructure passes the pathname of the monitor fi le to the appropriate event producer. The event producer veri fi es that the monitor fi le represents a valid event and that the process has access to monitor the event.
3. The process writes information to the fi le specifying:
- a. The wait type ( WAIT\_TYPE = WAIT\_IN\_READ or WAIT\_TYPE = WAIT\_IN\_SELECT ). The default wait type is WAIT\_IN\_SELECT .
- b. When to be noti fi ed. For state change events, the user must specify CHANGED=YES . For threshold value events, the user may specify THRESH\_HI = &lt;value&gt; , THRESH\_LO = &lt;value&gt; , or both, depending on the capabilities of the associated event producer. There is no default for this speci fi cation, and CHANGED=YES and THRESH\_* = &lt;value&gt; may not both be speci fi ed.
4. AIX Event Infrastructure will then allocate the per-process block to store this information if one does not already exist for this process and fi ll it with the information written by the user.
5. The process issues select() or a blocking read() on the monitor fi le
6. AIX Event Infrastructure will call ahafs\_evprods to check that the thresholds speci fi ed are valid for this particular event. For example, the utilFs event producer does not allow values of &gt; 100%. If the threshold is not valid, the select() or read() call will return RC\_FROM\_EVPROD and upon a read of the monitor fi le will be EINVAL returned.
7. For threshold value event producers, only one value is sent to the event producer for each threshold ( hi or lo ) for monitoring. At select() or blocking read() time, AIX Event Infrastructure will register this new threshold with the event producer if one of the following is true:
- a. If no other process is monitoring this event, the threshold (s) speci fi ed by this consumer are registered with the event producer.
- b. If there are other processes monitoring this event, then if the THRESH\_LO speci fi ed by the consumer is higher than the currently monitored low threshold OR if the THRESH\_HI speci fi ed by the consumer is lower than the currently monitored high threshold AIX Event Infrastructure calls into the ahafs\_evprods kernel service to update the currently monitored threshold.
8. Upon return from ahafs\_evprods kernel service, the actual value of the event is returned (in some cases). If the actual value returned has already met or exceeded either threshold, the read() or select() call will return immediately and the RC\_FROM\_EVPROD logged in the event buffer will be EALREADY . The read() or select() calls will return 0.
9. For state change event producers, the ahafs\_evprods function is always called to register the event.
10. Upon a successful registration, AIX Event Infrastructure sets up noti fi cation. For consumers waiting in select() , the noti fi cation is set up through selreg() . For consumers blocking in a read() call, the thread is put to sleep with e\_sleep\_thread() .
11. Once an event producer detects that an event has occurred, it will notify AIX Event Infrastructure with information regarding the event (i.e. information about the process triggering the event, the current value, the return code, etc.).
12. During this callback from the event producer, AIX Event Infrastructure will:
- a. Determine the ahaNode corresponding to the event
- b. Search the list of waiting consumers to determine whose thresholds have been met or exceeded to notify with the selnotify() or e\_wakeup() call. All consumers waiting on a state change event will be noti fi ed.
13. Once the process is noti fi ed of the event, it reads from the monitor fi le to obtain event data. An example of output from an event is below.

An example output for a state change event producer who has speci fi ed that a stack trace should be taken:

BEGIN\_EVENT\_INFO TIME\_tvsec=1269377315 TIME\_tvnsec=955475223 SEQUENCE\_NUM=0 PID=2490594 UID=0 UID\_LOGIN=0 GID=0 PROG\_NAME=cat RC\_FROM\_EVPROD=1000 END\_EVENT\_INFO

An example for a threshold value event:

BEGIN\_EVENT\_INFO TIME\_tvsec=1269378095 TIME\_tvnsec=959865951 SEQUENCE\_NUM=0 CURRENT\_VALUE=2 RC\_FROM\_EVPROD=1000 END\_EVENT\_INFO

Note: Due to the asynchronous nature of process noti fi cation, the current value returned may be stale by the time a process reads the monitor fi le. Users are noti fi ed when the threshold is fi rst met or exceeded, but other operations which may alter the values being monitored will not be blocked.

## Using the AIX Event Infrastructure

All directories in the AIX Event Infrastructure fi le system have an access mode of 1777 and all fi les have access mode of 0666.

Currently, all directories in the AIX Event Infrastructure fi le system have a mode of 1777 and all fi les have a mode of 0666. These modes cannot be changed, but the ownership of fi les and directories may be changed. Access control for monitoring events is done at the event producer level. Creation / modi fi cation times are not maintained and are always returned as the current time when issuing stat () on a fi le object within the pseudo fi le system. Any attempt to modify these times will return an error.

## Monitoring events

## Creating the monitor fi le

The monitor fi le corresponding to the event must be created to monitor an event.

Before monitoring an event, the monitor fi le corresponding to the event must be created. The AIX Event Infrastructure does support open() with the O\_CREAT flag. As an example, we will follow the steps required to monitor the fi le system / fi lesys/clj-fs for a utilization of 90%.

- The necessary subdirectories must also be created:
- Open the fi le /aha/fs/utilFs.monFactory/ fi lesys/clj-fs.mon .

```
mkdir /aha/fs/utilFs.monFactory/filesys
```

Before a monitor fi le can be created, the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension will call the event producer to determine if the event being requested is valid and to determine if the user has suf fi cient authority to monitor the speci fi ed event. Here are some of the common errors which can be returned from a monitor fi le create or open:

| ENODEV        | There is no event corresponding to the path speci fi ed. Note: An ENODEV error may still be returned when trying to open an existing monitor fi le when the event no longer exists. |
| EPERM         | User does not have permission to monitor the speci fi ed event.                                                                                                                     |
| ENOTSUP       | The event speci fi ed does not support monitoring by AIX Event Infrastructure.                                                                                                      |

## Writing to the monitor fi le

The consumer process writes to the monitor fi le to specify how and when it should be noti fi ed of events.

Once the monitor fi le desired is created and opened, the consumer process will write to the monitor fi le to specify how and when it should be noti fi ed of events. This data is written in &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; pairs which may be separated by a ; or whitespace. The acceptable &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; pairs are as follows:

Writing information to the monitor fi le only prepares for a subsequent select() or blocking read() call. Monitoring does not start until a select() or blocking read() is done.

For example, to monitor the fi le system / fi lesys/clj-fs for the fi rst occurrence of a utilization of 90% in a blocking read() call, the following string is written to the /aha/fs/utilFs.monFactory/ fi lesys/clj-fs.mon fi le:

WAIT\_TYPE=WAIT\_IN\_READ THRESH\_HI=90 NOTIFY\_CNT=1

## Waiting on events

Monitoring speci fi cations are written to the monitor fi le.

Once monitoring speci fi cations are successfully written to the monitor fi le, the consumer process will block for an event occurrence using select() or read() . Consumers are only noti fi ed of events that occur once they block in select() or read() . There are three ways that the process can return from select() or a blocking read() :

1. The event has occurred the speci fi ed number of times.
- Non-error case. Consumer should read event data to determine how to handle the event.
2. There was a problem when setting up the event inside the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension.

Errors may occur before the event is registered for monitoring with the event producer:

- read()
- If there is another thread waiting in read, the read will fail with EBUSY
- If there was no write done before this read, the read will just return 0, with 0 bytes read.
- select()

## Note:

Due to the implementation of the select system call, in order for select() to return an error, the underlying fi le system operations must return EBADF . As a result, if any of the following conditions are met, select() will return EBADF .

- Another thread is attempting a select
- The monitor fi le has been deleted
- There was no write done specifying monitoring speci fi cations
- There was an error when registering with the IOS subsystem

In these cases, there will be no event data to read.

3. There was a problem setting up the event with the event producer.

If an attempt is made to register the event with the event producer, an entry will be logged into the buffer for the consumer to read. To determine what error occurred, the RC\_FROM\_EVPROD returned in the event data should be referenced in the event producer's documentation. Note that the event output for this case will only contain the timestamp, sequence number and return code from the event producer, regardless of what INFO\_LVL has been speci fi ed. See 'Reading Event Data' on page 368 for an example.

In this case, select() will return EBADF , but read() will return the return code from the underlying uio\_move operation.

If the consumer process has speci fi ed a NOTIFY\_CNT greater than 1, information about each event occurrence will be logged in the consumer's buffer until the number of events request have occurred. The consumer process will only be woken up if the event has occurred the requested number of times, or an

unavailable event has occurred. Once the consumer process is woken up, it will no longer be monitoring the event until it re-issues a select() or blocking read() call for the monitor fi le.

If a consumer has speci fi ed a NOTIFY\_CNT of -1, the consumer process will be woken up after each occurrence of the event, and any event which occurs after the initial successful select() or blocking read() will be logged in the consumer buffer.

The select() and read() calls will not block if there is unread event data in the buffer.

## Unavailable Event Occurrences

For some event producers, there may be event occurrences that cause the monitored event to become invalid.

Some examples are:

- The death of a process for processMon and pidProcessMon .
- The unmounting of a fi le system containing monitored fi les for modDir and modFile .
- The unmounting of a fi le system which is being monitored by utilFs .
- The removal or renaming of a fi le which is being monitored by modDir or modFile
- The removal of an event producer which is currently being used to monitor events (The RC\_FROM\_EVPROD will be ENODEV in this case).

Once an unavailable event occurrence has been triggered, the consumers may not continue to monitor for that event until it becomes valid again. Examples of events becoming valid again:

- The remounting of a monitored fi le system.
- The recreation of a monitored fi le that was deleted.
- The recreation of a process that was being monitored.

When a local unavailable event is triggered, the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension will remove the monitor fi le(s) affected. When a monitor fi le is deleted, consumers who still have the fi le open will be able to read their event data, but will not be able to write or block waiting for an event occurrence on that monitor fi le. When an unavailable event occurrence is encountered by the consumer, they should take the appropriate action (which will presumably cause the event to become valid again), close the fi le descriptor for the monitor fi le, and re-open the monitor fi le with the O\_CREAT flag.

Local unavailable event occurrences will also cause select() and read() to unblock before the requested number of events occurrences have been triggered if the consumer has speci fi ed a NOTIFY\_CNT &gt; 1 . For example, if a consumer is monitoring fi le /foo with a NOTIFY\_CNT=3 , the consumer will return from select() or read() if /foo is removed even if it is the fi rst occurrence of an event with /foo .

## Using AIX Event Infrastructure for polling

AIX Event Infrastructure does not require that event producers always maintain the current value of events which may be monitored.

This is to allow for greater performance since event producers do not have the overhead of maintaining this value if no one is monitoring for occurrences of the event.

This creates a problem when using synchronous polling. Since it is not always possible to obtain the current value of an event at every point in time, poll() or synchronous select() calls are handled in the following way:

- When a process issues select() or poll() on a monitor fi le for the fi rst time, the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension will register that event for monitoring with the event producer.
- For threshold value event producers who do maintain the current value, the current value will be returned to the AIX Event Infrastructure kernel extension upon event registration. This value will be checked against the consumer threshold value at this time. If the consumer's threshold has been exceeded, the select() or poll() will indicate that the event has occurred and will have an RC\_FROM\_EVPROD of EALREADY .

- POLLSYNC flags are ignored. An event remains registered with the event producer until the event occurs the speci fi ed number of times, or until the user closes the fi le.
- Subsequent poll() calls will have the following behavior:
- If the event has not yet occurred, the call will return with no return events
- If the event has occurred the speci fi ed number of times since the last poll() call, return events will be set to indicate that the event has occurred.

## Reading Event Data

Event data in AIX Event Infrastructure consists of keyword-value pairs.

Event data may only be read once and no more than one event occurrence worth of data will be returned in a single read() call. For example, say that two events have occurred before the consumer reads from the monitor fi le and each event has 256 bytes worth of data. If the consumer calls read() for 4096 bytes, only the 256 bytes of the fi rst event will be returned to the user. A second read() call will need to be performed to obtain the data from the second event. Any offset given will be ignored and data will be read starting from the last unread byte.

Event data will be at the most 4096 bytes, although most events will be much smaller ( &lt; 512 bytes). It is recommended that when reading events, a large enough buffer should be used so as to avoid only reading part of an event.

Event data in AHAFS consists of keyword = value pairs, with the exception of BUF\_WRAP , EVENT\_OVERFLOW , BEGIN\_EVENT\_INFO , END\_EVENT\_INFO , BEGIN\_EVPROD\_INFO , END\_EVPROD\_INFO and STACK\_TRACE which are special keywords without any values. Here are the keywords you may see in event data:

| Key                               | Value   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BEGIN_EVPROD_INFO END_EVPROD_INFO | String* | These two keywords mark the beginning and end of the string returned by the event producer. There will always be a newline after BEGIN_EVPROD_INFO and before END_EVPROD_INFO . For consumers who have speci fi ed CLUSTER=YES , this is where node information will be given.                                                                                                     |
| STACK_TRACE                       | String* | For consumers who have speci fi ed INFO_LVL=3 with an event producer who has speci fi ed the AHAFS_STKTRACE_AVAILABLE capability, but not the AHAFS_CALLBACK_INTRCNTX capability, the stack trace of the event occurrence will be provided. The keyword STACK_TRACE indicates that the remaining event data, until the string END_EVENT_INFO is the stack of the event occurrence. |
| NUM_EVDROPS_INTRCNTX              | Integer | This keyword represents the number of interrupt-context event occurrences that are dropped since the time that is speci fi ed by the TIME0_tvsec and TIME0_tvnsec keywords in the report. The event occurrences are dropped only when the frequency of the event occurrence is high.                                                                                               |
| TIME0_tvsec TIME0_tvnsec          | Integer | These keywords record the time stamp of the fi rst event-occurrence drop in seconds and nano-seconds since the Epoch. These keywords are reported along with the NUM_EVDROPS_INTRCNTX keyword.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Duplicate Event Consolidation

If the same event occurs multiple times before the consumer has read the data, the duplicate entries will be consolidated into one entry. This consolidation is indicated by non sequential sequence numbers without a corresponding BUF\_WRAP keyword. The timestamp and sequence numbers will reflect the most recent occurrence of the event.

## Example Event Data

For an event producer which has speci fi ed AHAFS\_THRESHOLD\_STATE and

AHAFS\_STKTRACE\_AVAILABLE , and will pass a message to event consumers, the three levels of output look like this:

| INFO_LVL=1                                                                                                                                                       | INFO_LVL=2                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | INFO_LVL=3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For an event producer which has speci fi ed AHAFS\_THRESHOLD\_VALUE\_HI and has not speci fi ed AHAFS\_STKTRACE\_AVAILABLE , and will pass a message to event consumers, the three levels of output look like this:

| INFO_LVL=1                                                                                                                    | INFO_LVL=2                                                                                                                                                                                  | INFO_LVL=3                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BEGIN_EVENT_INFO TIME_tvsec=1269866715 TIME_tvnsec=16678418 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 CURRENT_VALUE=3 RC_FROM_EVPROD=1000 END_EVENT_INFO | BEGIN_EVENT_INFO TIME_tvsec=1269866715 TIME_tvnsec=16678418 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 CURRENT_VALUE=3 RC_FROM_EVPROD=1000 BEGIN_EVPROD_INFO event producer message here END_EVPROD_INFO END_EVENT_INFO | BEGIN_EVENT_INFO TIME_tvsec=1269866715 TIME_tvnsec=16678418 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 CURRENT_VALUE=3 RC_FROM_EVPROD=1000 BEGIN_EVPROD_INFO event producer message here END_EVPROD_INFO END_EVENT_INFO |

## Error format

If there is an error from the event producer, all event producers will have the following format for all INFO\_LVL :

BEGIN\_EVENT\_INFO TIME\_tvsec=1269868036 TIME\_tvnsec=966708948 SEQUENCE\_NUM=0 RC\_FROM\_EVPROD=20 END\_EVENT\_INFO

If a consumer is monitoring a AHAFS\_THRESHOLD\_VALUE event and the current value already exceeds the requested threshold, the error format will also be used to record this EALREADY event:

```
TIME_tvsec=1269868036 TIME_tvnsec=966708948 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 CURRENT_VALUE=1 RC_FROM_EVPROD=56
```

```
BEGIN_EVENT_INFO END_EVENT_INFO
```

## BUF\_WRAP and EVENT\_OVERFLOW

If unread data is overwritten by data from a new event occurrence, the keyword BUF\_WRAP will be the fi rst output from a read() on the monitor fi le. If there is a buffer wrap AND an event overflow, the BUF\_WRAP will always come fi rst, followed by the EVENT\_OVERFLOW . Here is an example output from read() in the case where we have both a buffer wrap and an event overflow:

First read() will return:

BUF\_WRAP

Second read() will return:

EVENT\_OVERFLOW

Third read() will return the event data that was able to fi t inside the buffer:

```
BEGIN_EVENT_INFO here
```

```
TIME_tvsec=1269863383 TIME_tvnsec=455993143 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 PID=6947038 UID=0 UID_LOGIN=0 GID=0 PROG_NAME=cat RC_FROM_EVPROD=1000 BEGIN_EVPROD_INFO event producer message END_EVPROD_INFO STACK_TRACE ahafs_prod_callback+3C4 ahafs_cbfn_wrapper+30 ahafs_vn_write+204 vnop_rdwr+7E4 vno_rw+B4 rwuio+12C rdwr+184 kewrite+16C .svc_instr write+1A4 _xwri
```

If event information is coming fast enough, it is possible to receive two BUF\_WRAP entries in a row. If you are seeing BUF\_WRAP , increase the size of the buffer (using BUF\_SIZE when writing to the monitor fi le).

## NUM\_EVDROPS\_INTRCNTX

If any interrupt-context event occurrence is dropped because of a high frequency of eventoccurrences, the output from a read() call on the event fi le, representing that event, contains the NUM\_EVDROPS\_INTRCNTX keyword just after the line that contains the BEGIN\_EVENT\_INFO keyword.

The following example represents an output from a read() call:

```
BEGIN_EVENT_INFO BEGIN_EVENT_INFO NUM_EVDROPS_INTRCNTX=5508 TIME0_tvsec=1353437661 TIME0_tvnsec=75494625 TIME_tvsec=1353437661 TIME_tvnsec=741365037
```

```
SEQUENCE_NUM=6663 event-producer...
```

RC\_FROM\_EVPROD=0 BEGIN\_EVPROD\_INFO ...msg from END\_EVPROD\_INFO END\_EVENT\_INFO

This example output contains the following sets of information:

- The NUM\_EVDROPS\_INTRCNTX=5508 value is the number of dropped interrupt-context eventoccurrences since the time that is speci fi ed by the TIME0\_tvsec and TIME0\_tvnsec fi elds.
- The remaining information (that is, SEQUENCE\_NUM=6663 , RC\_FROM\_EVPROD=0 , ...msg from event-producer... , and so on) is about the event that occurred at the time that is speci fi ed by the TIME\_tvsec and TIME\_tvnsec fi elds.

## Pre-de fi ned event producers

## modFile

The modFile event producer monitors for modi fi cations to the contents of a fi le.

## Overview

The modFile event producer resides under the fs directory and monitors for modi fi cations to a fi le. The following vnode operations are monitored: vnop\_rdwr() , vnop\_map\_lloff() , vnop\_remove() , vnop\_ftrunc() , vnop\_fclear() and vnop\_rename() . Modi fi cations which do not go through the LFS layer cannot be monitored (that is writes to mapped fi les).

Files may not be monitored if:

- They are in a remote fi le system.
- They are in fi le system of type ahafs , procfs or namefs .
- They are a symbolic link.
- They reside under a directory which ends with an AIX Event Infrastructure extension ( .mon , .list , .monFactory ).
- Monitor fi les with a full path name larger than MAXPATHLEN in the AIX Event Infrastructure pseudo fi le system cannot be monitored.

## Capabilities

```
AHAFS_THRESHOLD_STATE AHAFS_STKTRACE_AVAILABLE AHAFS_REMOTE_EVENT_ENABLED
```

## Return codes

The modFile event producer uses return codes which are de fi ned in &lt;sys/ahafs\_evProds.h&gt; .

These return codes are used to indicate how the contents of the monitored directory were modi fi ed:

## AHAFS\_MODFILE\_WRITE

The monitored fi le was written to.

## AHAFS\_MODFILE\_UNMOUNT

The fi le system containing the monitored fi le was unmounted. This is an unavailable event.

## Event producer message

This event producer does not pass any messages as part of its event data.

## Acceptable monitor fi les

To monitor for fi le modi fi cations, a monitor fi le with the same path as the fi le you wish to monitor should be created under the modFile.monFactory directory. For example, to monitor /etc/passwd , the monitor fi le /aha/fs/modFile.monFactory/etc/passwd.mon would be used.

## Example event data

The following event data was generated from a process writing to a monitored fi le. This is the output seen with an INFO\_LVL of 3:

```
BEGIN_EVENT_INFO TIME_tvsec=1271703118 TIME_tvnsec=409201093 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 PID=5701678 UID=0 UID_LOGIN=0 GID=0 PROG_NAME=cat RC_FROM_EVPROD=1000 STACK_TRACE aha_cbfn_wrapper+30 ahafs_evprods+510 aha_vn_write+154 vnop_rdwr+7E8 vno_rw+B4 rwuio+100 rdwr+188 kewrite+104 .svc_instr write+1A4 _xwrite+6C _xflsbuf+A8 __flsbuf+C0 copyopt+2E8 scat+22C main+11C __start+68 END_EVENT_INFO
```

## modFileAttr

The modFileAttr event producer monitors for modi fi cations to the attributes of a fi le.

## Overview

The modFileAttr event producer resides under the fs directory and monitors for modi fi cations to the attributes of a fi le or directory (mode, ownership and ACLs). The following vnode operations are monitored: vnop\_setattr() (only for V\_OWN and V\_MODE operations), vnop\_setacl() , vnop\_setxacl() , vnop\_remove() , vnop\_rename() and vnop\_rmdir() .

Files or directories may not be monitored if:

- They are in a remote fi le system
- They are in fi le system of type ahafs , procfs or namefs
- They reside under a directory which ends with an AIX Event Infrastructure extension ( .mon, .list, .monFactory )

- Monitor fi les with a full path name larger than MAXPATHLEN in the AIX Event Infrastructure pseudo fi le system cannot be monitored.

## Capabilities

```
AHAFS_THRESHOLD_STATE
```

```

## Example event data

The following event data was generated from a process changing the mode of a monitored fi le. This is the output seen with an INFO\_LVL of 3:

```
BEGIN_EVENT_INFO TIME_tvsec=1291994430 TIME_tvnsec=760097298 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 PID=5767216 UID=0 UID_LOGIN=0 GID=0 PROG_NAME=chmod RC_FROM_EVPROD=1010 STACK_TRACE ahafs_evprods+70C aha_process_attr+120 vnop_setattr+21C vsetattr@AF13_1+20 setnameattr+B4 chmod+110 .svc_instr change+3C8 main+190

```

## modDir

The modDir event producer monitors for modi fi cations to the contents of a directory.

## Overview

The modDir event producer resides under the fs directory and monitors for modi fi cations to the contents of a directory. The following vnode operations are monitored: vnop\_create() , vnop\_link() , vnop\_symlink() , vnop\_remove() , vnop\_rename() , vnop\_mkdir() , and vnop\_rmdir() .

Directories may not be monitored if:

- They are in a remote fi le system
- They are in fi le system of type ahafs , procfs or namefs
- They are a symbolic link
- They reside under a directory which ends with an AIX Event Infrastructure extension ( .mon , .list , .monFactory )
- Monitor fi les with a full path name larger than MAXPATHLEN in the AIX Event Infrastructure pseudo fi le system cannot be monitored.

The modDir event producer does not recursively monitor for directory modi fi cations. Only modi fi cations to the speci fi ed directory are monitored.

## Capabilities

```
AHAFS_THRESHOLD_STATE AHAFS_STKTRACE_AVAILABLE AHAFS_REMOTE_EVENT_ENABLED
```

## Return codes

The modDir event producer uses return codes which are de fi ned in &lt;sys/ahafs\_evProds.h&gt; .

These return codes are used to indicate how the contents of the monitored directory were modi fi ed:

## AHAFS\_MODDIR\_CREATE

A new fi le system object has been created under the monitored directory.

## AHAFS\_MODDIR\_UNMOUNT

The fi le system containing the monitored directory has been unmounted. This is an unavailable event.

## AHAFS\_MODDIR\_REMOVE

A fi le system object within the monitored directory has been removed.

## AHAFS\_MODDIR\_REMOVE\_SELF

The monitored directory itself has been removed or renamed. This is an unavailable event.

## Event producer message

The name of the fi le system object which triggered the event is included in the event data.

## Acceptable monitor fi les

To monitor for modi fi cations to the contents of a directory, a monitor fi le with the same path as the directory you wish to monitor should be created under the modDir.monFactory directory. For example, to monitor the directory /home/cheryl for modi fi cations, the monitor fi le /aha/fs/ modDir.monFactory/home/cheryl.mon would be used.

## Example event data

The following event data was generated from a new fi le named fi le1 being created in a monitored directory. This is the output seen with an INFO\_LVL of 3:

```
BEGIN_EVENT_INFO TIME_tvsec=1271780397
```

```
TIME_tvnsec=24369022 SEQUENCE_NUM=0 PID=6095102 UID=0 UID_LOGIN=0 GID=0 PROG_NAME=touch RC_FROM_EVPROD=1000 BEGIN_EVPROD_INFO file1 END_EVPROD_INFO STACK_TRACE aha_cbfn_wrapper+30 ahafs_evprods+510 aha_process_vnop+138 vnop_create_attr+4AC openpnp+418 openpath+100 copen+294 kopen+1C .svc_instr open+F8 creat64+1C main+1EC __start+68 END_EVENT_INFO
```

## utilFs

The utilFs event producer monitors the utilization of a fi le system.

## Overview

The utilFs event producer monitors the utilization of a fi le system as a percentage. It resides under the fs directory. Currently, only JFS2 fi le systems support utilFs monitoring. Upon every fi le write, fi le creation and fi le deletion, the utilization of the fi le system is checked to see if it meets or exceeds the given threshold. There may be some fi le system speci fi c operations which can affect the utilization of the fi le system, but utilFs may not be able to detect them until the next fi le write, creation or deletion. Thresholds which are exceeded due to the result of a fi le object deletion will not be noti fi ed until the next fi le write, create or deletion.

File systems with a monitor fi le path name larger than MAXPATHLEN in AHAFS cannot be monitored.

To avoid a flood of event noti fi cations and potential performance impacts, it is highly recommended that utilFs events are monitored with a NOTIFY\_CNT of 1.

## Capabilities

```
AHAFS_THRESHOLD_VALUE_HIGH AHAFS_THRESHOLD_VALUE_LOW AHAFS_REMOTE_EVENT_ENABLED
```

Thresholds speci fi ed must be between 1 and 100, inclusive.

## Return codes

The utilFs event producer uses return codes which are de fi ned in &lt;sys/ahafs\_evProds.h&gt; .

These return codes are used to indicate how the contents of the monitored directory were modi fi ed:

## AHAFS\_UTILFS\_THRESH\_HIT

The fi le system being monitored has reached the threshold speci fi ed.

## AHAFS\_UTILFS\_UNMOUNT

The fi le system being monitored has been unmounted. This is an unavailable event.

## Event producer message

This event producer does not pass any messages as part of its event data.

## Acceptable monitor fi les

To monitor for fi le system utilization, a monitor fi le with the same path as the mount point of the fi le system to be monitored should be created under the utilFs.monFactory directory. For example, to monitor the fi le system /data/fs1 , the monitor fi le /aha/fs/utilFs.monFactory/data/fs1.mon would be used.

## Example event data

The following is event data from an AHAFS\_UTILFS\_THRESH\_HIT event for an INFO\_LVL of 3:

```
BEGIN_EVENT_INFO TIME_tvsec=1271705858 TIME_tvnsec=704241888

## Acceptable monitor fi les

To monitor the socket operations, a monitor fi le that has the name of the socket operation that you want to monitor must be created in the inetsock.monFactory directory. For example, to monitor the TCP socket creation, the /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamCreate.mon monitor fi le is used. Similarly, to monitor UDP socket creation, the /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/ dgramCreate.mon monitor fi le is used.

The following fi les are used for all the Autonomic Health Advisor File System (AHAFS)-monitorable TCP socket operations:

- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamCreate.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamBind.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamListen.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamAccept.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamConnect.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamDisconnect.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamClose.mon

The following fi les are used for all the AHAFS-monitorable UDP socket operations:

- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/dgramCreate.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/dgramBind.mon
- /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/dgramClose.mon

## Example event data

The following event data was generated from a process when a socket is created. The following example is the output that is displayed with an output level of 2 (INFO\_LVL=2):

```
AHAFS event: /aha/net/inetsock.monFactory/streamCreate.mon
```

```

```

## Cluster events

When a system is part of a cluster, it can receive noti fi cations for events occurring on other nodes that are part of the same cluster. Event producers which specify the AHAFS\_REMOTE\_EVENT\_ENABLED capability support cluster wide monitoring. All the AIX Event Infrastructure event producers except the pidProcessMon and diskState can provide such remote noti fi cations.

Behaviour of mkcluster command with the AIX Event Infrastructure:

If the AIX Event Infrastructure is not loaded on a system and the mkcluster command is run then the AIX Event Infrastructure pseudo fi lesystem will be mounted on the /aha directory and the monitor fi le names will start from the /aha directory. If the AIX Event Infrastructure is already loaded on a system and mkcluster command is run then the AIX Event Infrastructure pseudo fi lesystem will not be remounted and the monitor fi le names will start from the directory over which the AIX Event Infrastructure pseudo fi lesystem has been mounted. Consumer applications must check where the AIX Event Infrastructure pseudo fi lesystem has been mounted, to get the monitor fi le paths.

In order to receive cluster events, consumer processes must specify CLUSTER=YES when writing to the monitor fi le representing the event to monitor in the cluster. In order for the remote events to be detected, a consumer process must be monitoring the event on each node with CLUSTER=YES speci fi ed.

Events received from a remote node do not include user or process information, or stack trace, even if the event producer supports it.

For events received on a remote node stack trace is not provided, even if the event producer supports it.

The cluster information NODE\_NUMBER , NODE\_ID and CLUSTER\_ID will be available between BEGIN\_EVPROD\_INFO and END\_EVPROD\_INFO delimiters for all cluster events. This helps the monitoring program to identify on which node the event occurred. The information that is returned from the lscluster -m command output in the fi elds: Cluster shorthand id for node, uuid for node and cluster uuids is returned in the AIX Event Infrastructure event output in the NODE\_NUMBER , NODE\_ID , CLUSTER\_ID fi elds respectively.

Below is example output from both a local and remote occurrence of an event with an INFO\_LVL of 2, and an event producer which speci fi es the AHAFS\_STKTRACE\_AVAILABLE capability.
